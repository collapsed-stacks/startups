If you have loads of meetings and require board member or shareholder approval to get things done then most startups will probably not even get off the ground. I don't know if crowdfunded personal projects are included, but many of them do develop into startup companies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second is to do with the more organic/non-traditional nature of working relationships between people. There may not be a strict employer-employee relationship, and some people are expected to take on multiple roles beyond what the job description may require. There are also many different types of networking and collaboration models that can co-exist, so people have to be more flexible and willing to give if they want to get something in return.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think these are the key differences between working in a startup versus being in an established company. In some ways some startups never move away from that original model that they work in (but it means that their size probably can't grow or scale as well), so there are definitely characteristics that we need to establish so that we get the right audience and discussion happening here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="71" LastActivityDate="2014-07-31T01:26:29.983" CommentCount="0" />

This is a time when we get to set a precedent.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, I'm thinking of the question &lt;a href=&quot;https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/78/how-b2b-startup-can-massively-cold-call-customers&quot;&gt;How B2B startup can massively &amp;quot;cold call&amp;quot; customers&lt;/a&gt;. I think that question is perfectly acceptable for our format. &quot;I have a business and I'd like to find creative ways to market it&quot; is an incredibly subjective matter, but I don't think it's subjective in a &lt;em&gt;bad way&lt;/em&gt;. It's applicable to many people, and some answers will be indisputably better than others.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for the question you raised, however, I agree that that's subjective in a bad way. It's broad and mostly unrealistic. That said, I think if the person rephrased it to be something more like, &quot;I own a tech startup that's tight on cash. Are there any solutions to get relatively cheap software (legally) that can help us build our product and generate some cash-flow before we invest in a more permanent solution?&quot; it wouldn't be such a bad question. Phrasing it the way the OP did, it sounds like they're looking for a miracle solution to get free software for life, and that's not very applicable to the real world and is unlikely to help people in the future. But by putting it as a request for resources for startups, I think it's more likely to help people in the future and deter the spam answers that none of us want to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Like I said, it's time for a precedent. We can choose whether we want those types of subjective, but generally applicable questions on this site. I see you have lots of rep on SO, so I'll put it in terms of Programmers (which allows for far more subjectivity than SO does): a question saying &quot;I need to write an algorithm that will [...]. Would I be best to use R or C#?&quot; might be an acceptable answer. You'd need some more details, but you see my point. There's &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; a good answer to that question, but there are undoubtedly people who will disagree based on loyalty to one platform or the other. However, &quot;I'm learning to program. Should I learn R or C#?&quot; is inappropriate by any person's measure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I personally think the direction we should aim to take Startups in should support questions that are subjective, as long as they can be answered with legitimate logic, reasoning, and experience. So if someone asks a question, even for an off-site resource, that can be answered logically, reasonably, and with experience to back the answer, I don't think that it's an inappropriate question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In other words, I think we need this close reason, but I also think that our emphasis should be on use of either &lt;code&gt;Too Broad&lt;/code&gt; or calling an answer spam.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="59" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:51:27.443" LastActivityDate="2014-08-01T23:10:47.397" CommentCount="9" />

But on a site like this, &quot;best helps you&quot; becomes a little more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When we're speaking in terms of, say, Stack Overflow--the most shocking example, I know--it's a little easier to decide. Generally speaking, the worst case is that multiple people give good or useful answers. In other words, your worst case is having too many right answers to pick from. If someone asks &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24674511/why-can-string-that-is-a-reference-type-be-a-non-null-const-while-other-referenc/24674612#24674612&quot;&gt;Why can string that is a reference type be a non-null const while other reference type consts must be null?&lt;/a&gt;,&quot; they'll receive an answer, or several, that explain why and that's easy enough.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But when we're talking about questions on our site here, that becomes a bit more difficult. We're dealing in the inherently grey area of business decisions and experience. What's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/195/best-way-of-dividing-equity-among-founders&quot;&gt;best way of dividing equity among founders&lt;/a&gt;? Well, that depends. Adam and I gave what we felt to be good guidelines, and if I may be so immodest I might say I think we both gave good answers, but I'm not sure anyone is in fair position to say &quot;oh, well, of course, the best way is....&quot; It's a subjective question, but of course, as Conner and I have &lt;a href=&quot;https://startups.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/26/are-recommendation-questions-off-topic/29#comment4_29&quot;&gt;briefly discussed&lt;/a&gt;, subjective (within reason) is not a bad thing here, so how should users choose the subjectively best answer?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I only bring this up because I'm seeing a lot of questions with a lot of good, up-voted answers, but no accepted ones. There are also clearly a lot of accepted ones as well, but I think we need a precedent on what an accepted answer means to our site in particular. 31 of our 79 questions at the time of posting this have no accepted answers, however I'm pretty sure a significant majority &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have at least one, up-voted answer. I recognize that such behavior could also be an artifact of the site's age, particularly for subjective questions it can be tempting to hold off for a week or two to make sure no clearly beautiful answers roll in late and I have no problem with that waiting period. But I feel like this will become a problem if it hasn't yet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So how do we want to view it? Is an accepted answer the most complete? The most eloquently written? The most up-voted? Is it the one that expresses the ideas the original poster most agrees with? Or is there some other metric--either quantifiable or otherwise--that could help an asker pick?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Or, maybe, is it okay to just &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; accept answers on some types of questions? Are there side-effects to not accepting answers, aside from the fact that they aren't, obviously, marked as accepted in the question list or on search result pages? Admittedly I've yet to utilize our asking abilities myself and I've stuck to answering other people's questions, but looking at some of those questions, I'm hard-pressed to pick which answer I would choose even if it were my call.

Maybe the site description can be adjusted to suit that a bit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thank you :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="92" LastActivityDate="2014-08-08T05:04:04.253" CommentCount="5" />

And I think broadening the focus would invite more people to ask questions (as many sole traders or craftsmen don't consider themselves to be fancy startups) &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; invite more professionals of any field into the discussion. I for one would certainly enjoy an answer from an MBA, financial analyst, marketeer or something the like. But unless they are in the process of starting their own business, they might not be interested to answer questions of startups. But they might answer questions of their general field. And I would also like to find out if grown businesses sometimes struggle with the same problems as a one-man-startup. Also individual departments sometimes have the same problems as startups, but the person in charge might not come to a startup QA site to look for help. Sometimes I want an answer from a person that has already successfully started a business and is still running it. But after some time she may not consider herself running a startup.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To cut a long story short, I vote for renaming &lt;code&gt;startups&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;business&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; I am not a native English speaker, so maybe there is a better term that describes &lt;code&gt;running a business&lt;/code&gt;.

How do you talk to investors? How do you lead employees? How do you shape your product or service? How do you fire up a WebSite? How do you settle dispute in a team? How do you use social media? How do you engage with your customers? How do you make a viral marketing campaign or become a growth hacker? How do you expand into a new country or create a new local branch? How do you make sales via phone? How do you get your first customer?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All of this are valid questions for a startup, but for any other business leader as well. Why should we exclude all those interesting views and questions and answers upfront instead of just skim over them if we are not interested (as in Perl vs Java)?

However, that said, I don't expect it to go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/status-completed&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;status-completed&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;status-completed&lt;/a&gt; any time soon, for a couple reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Priorities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Supporting a site the magnitude of the Stack Exchange network is inherently, well, hard, and there are other things going on that need more urgent addressing. Realistically, if you're concerned about your identity getting out there and an involved party becoming aware of your stance, you could either create another account with a separate email or clear your real account of any personally identifiable information. Now, of course, neither of those are as nice as having the feature implemented. And again, I'm in support of your idea. I just don't think that &quot;syntactic sugar,&quot; to use a coding metaphor, is at the top of the list to the SE team right now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk-Reward&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Speaking in terms, again, of the network as a whole, we have to look at the philosophy: do we want good questions, or do we &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; want &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; questions? Allowing for anonymous posting would lead to a lot of bad questions and straight-up spam. Now, I recognize, of course, that that's easy to combat post-facto. We can easily require authentication, then just hide the user information on the post. Then we'd follow the exact same rules as we do now, with close votes leading to blocked posting abilities and all that good stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But unfortunately, and this is really just a guess, I'd expect us to have to close a lot more questions, because people wouldn't feel accountable. I see a lot more bad questions posted by @user0000000 than I do by someone with their full name listed, and I'm virtually positive that that problem would just increase if we allowed for true anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, to combat my own point, we could require a minimum reputation--have it as a privilege. That would inherently reduce some of the anonymity, but it would work. But I've still seen some pretty embarrassingly bad questions asked by users on Stack Overflow with over ten thousand rep points.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reputation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Much of the brilliance of the Stack Exchange system lies in the accountability we all experience when posting something, because--less on Meta sites--it has a lasting effect on a score that is always displayed near our name. It seems a little weird, then, that someone could write an awesome question or &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/a/11227902/1270504&quot;&gt;answer&lt;/a&gt; (that link isn't really relevant, since it'd never be posted anonymously, but I still think it's cool--call me a Stack Exchange nerd, I can take it), get almost thirteen &lt;em&gt;thousand&lt;/em&gt; up-votes that add up to (200-point cap permitting) 130,000 points, but when you go to the person's profile it only shows a couple mediocre answers adding up to a couple hundred points. Obviously that's an extreme example, but you see my point. Something like that could happen if someone posted anonymously a lot, even just a few good posts (which I imagine many anonymous ones would be, since they'd be inherently &quot;meaty&quot;) could lead to a thousand rep points, that would then be left unaccounted for on a profile page.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, my immediate retort to that is &quot;well then, you just don't get rep points for an anonymous post!&quot; Fair enough, but does that give us an excuse to just go on and post &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/q/3905734/1270504&quot;&gt;not-so-hot&lt;/a&gt; questions on the long-shot that someone will answer, comfortable that we won't get penalized? This speaks somewhat to the idea, again, of letting only higher-rep users post anonymously, but it doesn't solve it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It isn't such a big deal, but badges follow the same issues: what if you get a &quot;Famous Question&quot; badge? Does the info page for that just say it can't display what the question was? Again, not such a big deal, but that's just another aspect of the site that would have to be adjusted to prepare for anonymous posting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long Story Short&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I like the idea, and I think it would be super useful for those of us who &lt;em&gt;wouldn't&lt;/em&gt; abuse it, but I think there are a lot of risks with implementing that sort of system, and it fundamentally opposes some of the philosophies of the site. So even though it'd be doable, and even though it'd be useful, I just don't see it happening any time soon. It's better just to anonymize your account, or create a separate one for more sensitive questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="59" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-05-23T12:38:54.797" LastActivityDate="2014-08-15T08:59:39.270" CommentCount="1" />

The rest is pretty much up to you!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are, however, a couple guidelines that must be followed:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The image that you create must be 220 x 250 pixels&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Must be hosted through our standard image uploader&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Must be GIF or PNG&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;No animated GIFs&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Absolute limit on file size of 150 KB&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, give your ad a border.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But beyond that, it's up to you what the content is, as long as it drives users back to our site and follows the typical community guidelines of what constitutes appropriate content here. So get those creative juices flowing! Also, if you have several ideas, great! But please limit them to one per answer, since that makes voting easier for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Be sure to include with your submission where the ad should point to. Yes, it has to be on Startups. But it can be our homepage, a specific question, or any other page here that you think will draw new users in.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Whether you've created an ad candidate or not, we have another question to answer. Where should our ads run? So far, we're thinking &lt;a href=&quot;https://workplace.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;The Workplace&lt;/a&gt; would be a nice target, but we're open to other suggestions too. And it doesn't have to be just one site. So if you know of a site on the Stack Exchange network that you think would be open to having our ads present, let us know in the comments below and we will speak with their moderators for the go-ahead to post there. If your ad is designed with a specific target site in mind, just be sure to mention that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And finally, if you have a great idea but not the artistic talent to back it, we'd love to hear that too. Just bring it up in the comments and hopefully someone else will bring it to life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; We've launched one ad on &lt;a href=&quot;https://workplace.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2411/community-promotion-ads-2014/2966#2966&quot;&gt;The Workplace&lt;/a&gt;!

It's not quite the usual etiquette, but I suggest that some of the most fruitful answers could themselves be questions, leaving the comments thread for people to suggest ways.

Emacs had a very active and quick startup process which &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/143952/what-currently-makes-an-area-51-proposal-successful-and-what-should-make-it-suc/236870#236870&quot;&gt;helps alot&lt;/a&gt;, while the startups proposal took a few months to pick up steam, so many of our committers (93.9%) have not followed through on their commitment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the advantages Worldbuilding has over us, is that it produces hot questions. Questions with funny titles like &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/questions/843/how-do-i-drug-a-population-in-the-most-efficient-way&quot;&gt;How do I drug a population in the most efficient way?&lt;/a&gt; bring a lot of curious traffic to the site. I think I've only seen one or two startups questions appear as hot network questions. &lt;a href=&quot;https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/260/better-to-learn-programming-or-hire-a-programmer&quot;&gt;Better to learn programming, or hire a programmer?&lt;/a&gt; was probably an interesting hot question, because much of the Stack Exchange network is about programming.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It looks like all of the business proposals can build up a large mass of users and do well with views per day, but even after years of beta still struggle with questions per day. If we continue at this pace, we'd likely end up like one of those sites. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't have a specific plan for improving our sites metrics, but a few general ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increase Site Scope&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We've had some discussions dating back the the initial proposal on whether the startsups definition was too strict and vague. &lt;a href=&quot;https://startups.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/92/is-our-name-appropriate&quot;&gt;Is our name appropriate?&lt;/a&gt; never really gained much traction though. We allow questions from all businesses, regardless of whether or not they consider themselves a startup, as long as it's on-topic for the site. The site name may disuade potential users though.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attract New Users&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is what the advertising post is trying to achieve. Even if we don't appear on the hot network questions, we can still have sidebar ads on other sites.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some other ideas may be promoting this site with other startup communities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Community Building Events&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As we get new users, how do we keep them involved? Right now our chat room is pretty quiet most days. One idea could be to have some sort of &quot;Show Startups&quot; event, where everyone gets a chance to show off what they've been working on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sorry if this is all jumbled, I just wanted to get some thoughts out there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="9" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:52:24.153" LastActivityDate="2014-10-19T01:08:31.663" CommentCount="3" />

After a few days or weeks, the project(s) have a landing page: this is like arriving at Go with a top hat and a bank balance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The deal is, each time the team has a major decision to make, even if it's one where there's unanimity, they bring it back as a question. The answer that scores highest (after say 3 days, and subject to a bit of moderation to keep answerers and voters free from the temptation to just make outrageous suggestions) is then what to do next.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If a team can't run with the answer, it's bankrupt. Otherwise, it runs on to the next decision to bring back to Startups.SE.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The idea isn't to create the world's best startup, but to get some questions that are not only real and timely, but where the answers get applied, and the community gets the next question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So like I say, this is probably a super bad idea. The only merit is, if I heard this was happening somewhere on the Internet, I would want to watch or take part!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, virtual colleagues, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;what about&lt;/em&gt; a Startups.SE startup?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="425" LastActivityDate="2014-12-31T23:54:18.713" Title="What about a Startups.SE startup?"

In the future, I'd be tempted to include a link to the FAQ post &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5234/how-does-accepting-an-answer-work&quot;&gt;&quot;How does accepting an answer work?&quot;&lt;/a&gt;, just because that gives the person a resource and makes it a bit more about teaching.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If I were to leave such a comment, it'd probably look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Awesome!

If it does, I'd appreciate if you could &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5234/how-does-accepting-an-answer-work&quot;&gt;accept this answer&lt;/a&gt; so it can be more easily found by users in the future with similar problems.

I make it more about helping others, which is really the main goal of accepting answers, even if we do all love the rep, and doesn't work off of the assumption that we completely answered the question, even if the person has already hinted at it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, trying to explain this all is probably more difficult than putting into action. If you honestly think the person would benefit from the reminder, go ahead. But don't make too much a habit of it, because if you're doing it a lot, that's probably indicative that you aren't being super careful with it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr/&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I guess another note is that sometimes, people flag comments like this as &quot;Not Constructive.&quot; In such cases, I'd typically let the comment hang out for a little while, then delete it. I don't think that's ever actually happened here, but eventually it will. So don't be too upset if a comment like that does get deleted.

There've been a few cases of people suggesting Law as a site on Area51, it getting through commitment, then getting shot down (there's one there now, actually, although it's anyone's guess whether it will get a beta period or not). Nobody wants that liability.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But yes, as you suggest in your first question, there's definitely a line (&lt;em&gt;somewhere&lt;/em&gt;) between what's acceptable and what's not, and I think there's an unreasonably subtle distinction between those two.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure how we can make it less subtle--although if we could, it could make a nice third &quot;Vote to Close&quot; reason someday--but right now, like the legal system, I think it just depends on how it's worded, both the question and the answer. I'm okay with posts that say things like &quot;might.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've personally answered a number of &lt;a href=&quot;https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/intellectual-property&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;intellectual-property&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;intellectual-property&lt;/a&gt; questions since this site went into private beta, and anyone who reads through those will notice something of a pattern.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Well, it really depends on a few things, but chances are...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;But it wouldn't be a bad thing to talk with a patent professional before continuing, to go over your specific case.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think disclaimers like that are nice in a few ways, not the least of which being that you're reminding the asker that, hey, I don't know everything about you, your business, your competitor's business, or any of that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The same sort of thing applies to questions. Your example, &quot;can I do this legally?&quot;, if I were asking this question myself, I would probably say &quot;What might be some legal risks of doing this?&quot; The key here is in asking for the negative right: the question isn't &quot;can I do this,&quot; but rather, &quot;is there any reason why I can't do this?&quot; Nobody could be qualified through a system such as this to fully answer the first question, but all the second one takes is a single point.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An important thing to remember here, is that nobody is &lt;em&gt;trying&lt;/em&gt; to get anyone else in trouble. If someone asks a question that's blatantly deserving of an attorney's attention, that's probably because they don't realize the severity or variability of it. I know that's obvious to think about now, but it isn't always quite so clear in the heat of actually answering a question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For that reason, I think it's good to include a sentence or two--a &quot;legal disclaimer,&quot; albeit not quite so technical--that points out that a lawyer might be the best option.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for your second question, I think that gets a bit more difficult to answer fully. Mostly because I honestly don't really know.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's a related MSE post with what I think is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/18571/263510&quot;&gt;good answer&lt;/a&gt;. It quotes the Creative Commons license under which this all falls. I'll let you click through there to avoid quoting the entire answer, but essentially,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;UNLESS OTHERWISE AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE MATERIALS&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are a few clauses there, but they all have that kind of effect. So I definitely wouldn't worry too much about this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But at the same time, &lt;em&gt;when in doubt...&lt;/em&gt;. I wouldn't jump in and answer something if I thought there was reasonable concern that it could lead to a lawsuit, even if that would never happen in practice. If a question is phrased such that an answer is that risky, it's &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; not a good question. That's a good time to comment, or perhaps even just edit the question and make it a bit more &quot;negative right&quot;-ish, as described before.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My personal answer to your third can probably be pieced together from what I've already said, but basically, yes! A standard would be great. If you're feeling like it, asking that question in a separate meta post in the scope of &quot;should this be a Close Vote reason?&quot; might be a good idea. We've been looking for a good third one, and that could be it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr /&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Phew, so that's my answer (Don't take it as legal advice :) ).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But just a few extra side-notes about things to note when asking and answering questions. I'm paraphrasing a Community Manager here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure any legal questions are very descriptive of the actual circumstances. It's surprisingly easy for these questions to become either too broad or primarily opinion-based, and neither of those lead to productive posts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure legal questions include the location, and make sure you're mindful of it when answering. I've done that a few times in the past--a person asks a question, I get halfway through writing an answer, realize they didn't specify their location, learn they're somewhere completely unrelated to what I had assumed, and scrap the answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(This speaks something to your second question, as well) Anecdotes aren't an appropriate way to answer a legal question. Make sure any answer is backed up with evidence. That's generally true of questions here, but it's particularly relevant for legal ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Am I allowed to speed on my way to work?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Of course!

For instance, indie production companies are keen to build long tail value for niche shows and channels; fans are often highly motivated to build community around interesting content; bridging the two could be a great bootstrap, because you only need one show or channel to get started, you don't need to ask permission, it's inherently simple to scrape initial content into the back end, and focusing on strong existing content lowers the bar in terms of what needs to be added to the UX day one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, I want to stress that I'm not wedded to that idea.

And I honestly don't know. Or rather, I wish it weren't so simple.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think the unfortunate reality is just that some things shouldn't be asked in a public arena like this. And there are lots of great questions that don't include every little detail about a business strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's lots of talk all over the Stack Exchange network about people not including enough information in questions. So much talk, even, that it's sometimes difficult to discern what &quot;enough&quot; even means. It feels like we're just supposed to include everything we know about a scenario.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But that's not the case. Those philosophies are targeted at sites like Stack Overflow, where there are simply enough users that the statistics add up and people start posting things like,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Sometimes when I press a button on my UI, it doesn't do what I'd expect it to.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I, of course, use that hypothetical example as hyperbole. But those are the sorts of things that we &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; need to avoid. The analogue here looks something like,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I'm looking to start a website, how many people should I hire?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But that doesn't mean we have to include secrets in our posts. When people do that, we end up with questions like,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Sometimes when I press a button on my UI, it doesn't do what I'd expect it to. &lt;em&gt;And here's all the code I've written in the last five years, as well as my report card from seventh grade.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That's why Stack Overflow has the whole concept of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve&quot;&gt;Minimal, Verifiable, and Complete example&lt;/a&gt;. We aren't quite so technical here, partially because we simply can't be (business questions aren't the same as code questions), but the same theory applies. Tell answerers what they need to know to give an awesome answer, but don't whittle away the hours explaining everything you learned in business school.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Take a look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions&quot;&gt;top-voted questions&lt;/a&gt; on our site so far. Here are the (currently) top three:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/260/better-to-learn-programming-or-hire-a-programmer&quot;&gt;Better to learn programming, or hire a programmer?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/2/dividing-profits-amongst-developers-and-designers&quot;&gt;Dividing profits amongst developers and designers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/17/i-have-a-great-idea-but-im-not-great-at-marketing-or-sales-how-do-i-approach&quot;&gt;I have a great idea, but I'm not great at marketing or sales. How do I approach this?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Looking at them, it's clear that, while they're all great and interesting questions, not one of them divulges the actual business processes they're talking about. At most, they say something along the lines of &quot;I'd like to write an app.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not every great question needs to include every detail that led up to its relevance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If your question pertains very specifically to the very specific circumstances you're facing, there's a good chance that your question could be made a bit broader to fit more people anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes--normally, even--this isn't the easiest part. It's often easier (for us as askers, at least) to spit out our questions verbatim just as we're thinking about them. That's not what makes a good question here. What makes a good question is thinking through your question and bringing it down to its bare minimum. Finding relevant aspects of your situation is a task on its own, and sometimes it's hard to know what's relevant and what's not. But that's how great questions (and, in turn, answers) are formed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's a big difference between &quot;this question is too broad&quot; and &quot;what are the last four digits of your social security number and the name of your first childhood pet?&quot; and it's important to find and focus on that difference.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you do run through all of this and you're still worried that you're divulging too much, as I led with, this might just not be a great place to ask that question. In business, we make a ton of decisions every day, and not all of them are completely crowd-source-able.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The best not-always-obvious solution I have for you in those edge-edge cases, where the issue is more in the hands of &quot;I'm going to say something in my question that could offend someone I know in real life if they knew I asked it, but it's an important and on-topic question,&quot; is creating a second account. There's something of a misconception with some, where people believe it's against SE rules to have more than one account. This is not the case. What's against the rules is using a secondary account to game the system--award rep, cast multiple close-votes, etc.--but using a second account to make posts anonymous is completely fine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr/&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I don't think there is one right answer to this. And I agree that it's definitely a difficult line to find. But it's really just a judgement call that we have to make when posting questions. It has to be decided on a case-by-case basis, and you have to think about the risk-reward scenario you're setting up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="59" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-05-23T12:38:54.797" LastActivityDate="2014-12-06T11:14:20.343" CommentCount="0" />

The process has changed a lot since Area 51 began and is &lt;a href=&quot;https://area51.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5089/next-generation-of-area-51&quot;&gt;long overdue&lt;/a&gt; for a rehaul. Stack Exchange has a much different system for graduating sites these days.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Those stats are still useful for a quick look at the health of a site though. The questions per day is the probably the statistic I look at most. It's easy to see how any one day is relative to the average. For example, yesterday we got 4 questions, so the average is improving slightly. The counting stats will increase with time, and views will come with more questions. Our questions per day average seems to fluctuate between 2-6, which slightly less than half of the goal of 10 per day, but it doesn't put us in the dead site category.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's telling that our worst stats are labeled &quot;Needs Work&quot;. Stack Exchange is not branding Startups as a failing site, but rather one that isn't ready to stand on its own yet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As blunders pointed out we're fairly comparable to our peer betas. There are some doing much better and some doing much worse. We don't have the statistics to graduate right now, but very few sites are able to graduate in under a year. I elaborated a bit on this in &lt;a href=&quot;https://startups.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/123/what-can-we-do-to-double-the-sites-utility-then-double-it-again/124#124&quot;&gt;What can we do to double the site&amp;#39;s utility, then double it again?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are definitely improvements to be made however. Like you mentioned, more questions and more users would help greatly, the issue is those are a little harder to obtain. We've just recently started weekly topic challenges which have helped other young sites create questions, and when 2015's advertising cycle begins we're planning on advertising on more Stack Exchange sites. &lt;a href=&quot;https://workplace.meta.stackexchange.com/ads/display/2411&quot;&gt;Our ad&lt;/a&gt; on the workplace has been bringing in about 8 people a day. We're still looking for more strategies beyond the weekly topics and ads to improve these numbers, so if you have any ideas please share them.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm definitely a proponent of voting. More importantly than raising our number of high rep users, it helps distinguish what makes good content on the site. In fact voting is the first moderation priviledge given on all stack exchange sites because of its importance. At this stage we want good momentum and quality content, voting up certain users to hit the 3k or 2k marks won't help in the long run, but voting on quality will.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Based on some of the great content posted here, and the activity of our users, I have a lot of faith in this site succeeding, but it definitely still has some work to do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="9" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-05-03T08:41:04.687" LastActivityDate="2014-12-16T01:50:09.300" CommentCount="0" />

Of course, there's stuff to do here or there, and we've seen one or two flags over the months, but all in all, as a moderator and an avid user of the site, I would comfortably affirm that a significant majority of these 1500 posts are of high quality and convey either through personal experience or scientific research some very useful best practices in forming and running a startup or small business.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So you go, everyone!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For those worried about the state of the site, worry about quality over quantity.

And the discussion is far from over.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We do have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://startups.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/102/vote-to-close-recommendation-posts?lq=1&quot;&gt;vote-to-close&lt;/a&gt; reason set up, so technically, no, they are currently more or less not on-topic. But the idea has come up a couple times in moderator chat of opening that up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our goal--and this is obvious, but stay with me--is to provide and host awesome content. Everyone here, I figure, holds that common goal. &quot;Awesome content&quot; is hard to define, and indeed if you point at a post, one person might say &quot;yeah!&quot; as another is running in fear, but ultimately there are some standards that Stack Exchange has put forth about how we want the site to look and feel, and there are some commonalities on which pretty well anyone who cares will agree.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My personal hesitation with recommendation posts of this kind is that they don't always turn into awesome content.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Me being critical&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I came across a post the other day, and I'm not linking to it because that's irrelevant, but here's the actual, full quote:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;h2&gt;Computer Generated Content&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I need a piece of software that will scan multiple websites (of the user's choosing) and write a short informative piece about the topic. I need it to be compatible with Mac or Linux and be moderately quick.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/linux&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;linux&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;linux&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/osx&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;osx&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;osx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That's not awesome content. Granted, of course, it was put on hold within two hours of being posted, but you see my point. I'm assuming that the asker of this question felt that that was enough. We're small business owners here, so most of us probably know: sometimes people have a difficult time accurately conveying their needs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't want to see our homepage flooded with questions like this. I'm not saying that's going to happen, but it's a risk.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, there's the simple nature of off-site resources: they're, well, off-site. Because of that:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;They're not self-contained, and I have to click a link to ensure validity of an answer.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;They'll mostly expire eventually, either in accuracy or direct content (some new software blows the suggestion out of the water, or the suggestion goes out of business).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On top of that, they're generally fairly opinion-based, whether they have to be or not.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In short, software and tools requests require a different type of moderation (by users and us diamonded folks) than other posts. That's okay, but it's an investment we have to be ready to take on as a collective site, and it's something we want to make sure we're &lt;em&gt;into&lt;/em&gt; before we jump too fast.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, too, I want to make sure we don't dilute posts that &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; need off-site resources. For example, imagine I asked the question &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/1713/how-can-i-retain-customers-for-my-seasonal-business&quot;&gt;How can I retain customers for my seasonal business?&lt;/a&gt;&quot; and got the answer &quot;I know of an awesome ad platform that will target customers for repeat business, here's the link.&quot; Right now, that would be a not-so-hot answer to a question that could (and did) get a good, full, self-contained one. But by opening ourselves up to full-on &quot;what software does &lt;em&gt;[this]&lt;/em&gt;?&quot; questions, that becomes a less unacceptable answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Clearly that's something of a convoluted concern, because one bad answer doesn't mean any fewer good ones in theory, but in practice I worry that it could.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Me being supportive&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All that said, we aim to help startups and small business owners, and startups and small business owners often need software.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That wasn't such a mouthful. But I think it's really important. We sure don't want to shut out questions that would be helpful, since if we start doing that, we're kind of circumventing our central goal here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;The current state of things&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Feeling like I haven't even kind of answered the question here? Me too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, here goes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'll let you, and anyone else who reads this, in on a little secret: that vote to close reason I mentioned a while ago? We haven't really been using it much. We've fallen into non-enforcement with this, and I can't say I totally dig it. We, your moderator team, has been more or less leaving these sorts of questions up to the community to do with as you will. That's cool and all, but it's not consistent, which is an important part of community development.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I can only really speak for myself on this, but when I see an awesomely researched and put together question, I don't want to close it, and I won't. If it's only boarder-line-relevant to startups, I'll push it over to our friends at &lt;a href=&quot;http://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com&quot;&gt;Software Recommendations&lt;/a&gt; (a site that's actually devoted to these types of requests), but if I think it's going to be useful to visitors in the future and it's put together well, I'll leave it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But that's all super unofficial. Technically, again, anyone would be right to close that question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I guess I have two answers for you:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;No, those questions would be off-topic...&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;...unless you phrase it right.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We'll be looking into options over the next little while to better-phrase that vote-to-close reason to better reflect the real goal (we want those questions, just only if they're really about startups and well put together and answerable in an objective way).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you have suggestions about how we can convey that in an effective way, or if you'd like to take part in the discussion over the validity of these questions and whether they should be welcome here, I'll urge you over to &lt;a href=&quot;https://startups.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/102/vote-to-close-recommendation-posts?lq=1&quot;&gt;that previously listed post&lt;/a&gt;. Feel free to post an answer and say &quot;Hey, Matthew, man, this is awful. We need those kinds of posts and they're useful and I love them and I love asking and answering them and I need them in my life!&quot; or &quot;I hate them, I hate them, I hate them! I never want to see one of these questions again!&quot; We haven't viewed this as a super, super high priority because we don't see many posts of the nature, but we can definitely think about it more and get something pushed out if it's a problem that's facing people today.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Again, the press is just to figure out how we can do it, and whether these kinds of moderation concerns are worth the investment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In any event, it's worth noting the &quot;loophole&quot; of sorts to our current system: if you list your problem statement, it's on-topic. That's not always applicable, and in fact isn't really in many of the examples you listed, but much of the time, it is. Consider if you wanted to ask &quot;what software is there that will let me keep track of customer relations?&quot; If you just swapped it around and said &quot;My business is growing, how can I manage my clients to make them each feel independently supported?&quot; and listed some details, that would be acceptable and probably come to a similar answer. The same is true for your second-to-last example, of how remote staff can interact; if you said &quot;I have a growing distributed team, how can I help keep everyone on the same page?&quot; That would be an awesome question, and it would very well lead to an even more awesome answer that included everything and more as an answer to &quot;What remote collaboration software can my team use?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is another of those inconsistencies that I'd love to see fixed, and again, you and everyone else should know that we are, in fact, actively thinking about this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'd hold off on asking the very literal &quot;I need software that will let marketing people A/B test my homepage&quot; for now, though. I think that's a bit too far for our unofficial system to be pushed. Most of this was with reference to questions where the answer would likely include some reference to software.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="59" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:51:27.443" LastActivityDate="2014-12-25T08:10:37.303" CommentCount="3" />

I've been thinking about starting the same discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The initial reason for not allowing recommendation questions was to avoid questions like &quot;What free software have you found most useful for your startup?&quot; Those questions are aimed more at starting a discussion than answering a question, so they aren't a great fit for the Q/A format. In hindsight we could have just closed questions like that as too broad or opinion based, but we ended up adapting Stack Overflow's policy of no recommendation questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Like Matthew said, we've had some discussions about this. We ran into trouble operating by the letter of the law and closing (and later reopening) questions like &lt;a href=&quot;https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/952/hr-solutions-for-small-business&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.

This was true for both mentioned tags, prior to some edit to the respective questions. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I looked at the list of tags and found a number of tags that are pure abbreviations.

Maybe these abbreviations can be added as synonyms to the written-out tags. Also, I can do the retagging, but I did not want to flood the queue (at least not without warning/approval).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr /&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is another tag, probably related to taxes in the USA, which I would like to mention, but I do not know, if there actually is a written-out version for this. If not, I would suggest to add a tag-wiki text to explain what it is about.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/83b&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;83b&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;83b&lt;/a&gt; - 1 question&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr /&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally there are three abbreviation-tags, which are related to the primary topic here.

The standards are similar, and might even be identical, but there's still a big difference in what each one means so I feel like I should acknowledge that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are five main principles that you should be sure to contemplate when drafting your self-referential or promotional post.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Disclose your relationship&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is the simplest one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Don't go posting links to your own stuff saying &quot;this is awesome&quot; without explaining &quot;and I get paid to say that.&quot; As long as you don't hide your association with the product, you should be fine. Make sure readers understand your bias, so that they can make informed decisions on how much weight to lend your answer. Sometimes, knowing a person's relationship to a company can even add credibility to their suggestion of it. Honesty is valuable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Be relevant&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I said that was the simplest, but it might actually be this one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just make sure that what you're referencing or promoting is actually relevant to the context.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a counter-example,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I was wondering why so many companies build widgets when wodgets seem so much more fun, and by the way check out my awesome YouTube channel where I post videos of my cats!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Be Self-Contained&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Stack Exchange is built to be a one-stop shop for all your question and answer needs, and as such, &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/8231/are-answers-that-just-contain-links-elsewhere-really-good-answers&quot;&gt;link-only answers&lt;/a&gt; are frowned upon. That very same principle applies over to questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Make sure your post can stand on its own, without your link there. This means that a user without any prior knowledge (unless it's standard area knowledge) about your company should be able to understand your question without clicking on any links.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Instead of writing something like this (which is too broad for other reasons, and used only as an example),&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I've created an app, you can download it &lt;em&gt;[here]&lt;/em&gt;. What should I do to market it?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;try adding some more details,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I've created an app that lets you count how many widgets you have in your closet. What should I do to market it?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The link is &lt;em&gt;[here]&lt;/em&gt;, if you need more information.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Clarify as requested&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is practically identical to the previous one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If someone asks you a question, edit your post to answer it. Never respond with just a link. If someone isn't willing to click your link, the burden is on you to fill them in. Again, feel free to include a link as extra detail, but &lt;strong&gt;your post should stand on its own.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Write a question/answer, not a sales pitch&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Be succinct.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can include an elevator pitch in your post if you need to, but the purpose of your post should be to ask or answer a question. You are supplying &lt;em&gt;information&lt;/em&gt; with your post, you aren't pitching to potential clients or investors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Rather than,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I've created an app that lets you count how many widgets you have in your closet. It's amazing, you should see it. You can download it right on your Android device with 4.0.3 or higher, then you don't even have to open the closet door! Using infrared technology, I modify your phone's camera to track the presence of widgets via their heat signature. Try it today before you buy, and I'll send you a free T-Shirt.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;What should I do to market it?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just include the &lt;em&gt;pertinent&lt;/em&gt; details.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The same principle applies to comments. If someone asks, &quot;what's your price point now?,&quot; answer them informatively, not as a marketing pitch.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Limit yourself&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is heavily contingent on my previous points, but if you clearly put effort into making every one of your posts reference your own personal business (imagine someone who comes on the site only to answer marketing questions with &quot;try my product!&quot;), you're probably using the site wrong, and you may have a moderator contact you. However, if you only once in a while bring it up, or if you only include the necessary details on each question you asked, it should be fine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, it's just a matter of mindset. If you come on Startups and ask or answer a question, make sure your motives are in learning or sharing information. If you do it to promote your product, you're using the site wrong, and other users will notice. Have a good time, talk about your work in &lt;a href=&quot;http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/16081/startups&quot;&gt;chat&lt;/a&gt; if you'd like (and if other users are receptive), and ask questions here on &lt;a href=&quot;/questions/ask&quot;&gt;meta&lt;/a&gt; if you aren't sure about a specific case.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="59" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-03-20T10:32:14.520" LastActivityDate="2015-01-29T09:46:40.007" CommentCount="0" CommunityOwnedDate="2015-01-29T09:46:40.007" />

That's what bounties and the &quot;sorted by votes&quot; unanswered page is for. But I would like, if we could control it (which we can't), to keep questions answered &lt;em&gt;someday.&lt;/em&gt; And when someone asks a very specific question about something very specific that some very specific company did, that runs the risk of never being answered, ever.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Help the masses&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not to mention, it's policy here on Stack Exchange to keep questions and answers useful to the masses. That's (part of) why we don't allow &quot;what do you think of this name?&quot; or &quot;is this business feasible?&quot; questions. Is a specific question about a specific business's past practices generally applicable? Maybe. Probably, to a point. But I bet oftentimes not.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Explain yourself&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On top of that, it's also policy here to be able to explain your answers, that that's generally out of the realm of possibility with those kinds of questions. If you ask me why Stack Exchange gives its on-premise employees free lunch, and I tell you &quot;it's to increase morale&quot; (I'm assuming there already, but this is just an example), then you ask &quot;why does that matter?&quot; or &quot;how does it do that?&quot; I'm stuck. There's a good chance it's buried in a podcast somewhere, so maybe this is a bad example, but more generally speaking, I can answer why I think morale matters, or I can answer how I think free lunch boosts morale, but at some point in that spiral, we'll stop talking about what Stack Exchange does and we'll start building off of my own expertise, which is suddenly not what you're asking for.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Use our experts&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Given all that, I would much rather see questions that directly leverage the experts of our community, rather than the experts of other startups. It might lull someone into a false sense of security to learn that Twitter did one thing, for example--they might start doing it, without knowing that it's completely wrong for their business.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Solve &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; problem, not theirs&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the question is asked in the context of the actual business, and with the pretense that answerers can't know everything about that business, we avoid a huge risk of the oft-quoted &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/66377/what-is-the-xy-problem&quot;&gt;XY Problem&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That's no reason to block these questions from the site, granted. As long as someone is aware of the consequences of ignorantly following a successful business, or if they're just curious and don't intend to use the information for anything, that's not such a problem. And it's not our job to police people's use of the information we grant to them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've never seen the advantages to outweigh the disadvantages with these questions. I just don't see them as fitting in very well with the rest of our content here. Again, though, that's just me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said, way back in the day, when the very first of these questions was asked on the site, I brought it up in our private, moderator chatroom. There, we decided to hold off and see how often they happen, and how the community organically reacted. So far, I haven't seen a problem in quantity, nor votes.

I'll keep looking, but essentially, here's what I know.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On one hand, we have what Stack Exchange wants.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my experience, Stack Exchange tends to follow two philosophies when it comes to legality and ethics of questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;First and foremost is the terms of service.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This doesn't strictly relate to the question at hand, but the same principle (the spirit of the law, as they say) can be applied here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Use of the Network or Services to violate the security of any computer network, crack passwords or security encryption codes, transfer or store illegal material including that are deemed threatening or obscene, or engage in any kind of illegal activity is expressly prohibited.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Essentially, Stack Exchange doesn't want to be liable, with good reason, for displaying the next big security breach publicly. Similarly, I suspect, the company doesn't want to host the steps to tax fraud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, there's a principle that I've read that, in general, some things can be used for bad, but just because something can be used for bad doesn't make it intrinsically bad.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I could pop on here, ask a question about how to find a capable developer, then hire a developer to write some very, very evil software for me. Just because that question &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be used to hurt people, doesn't mean it has to be.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Speaking to Stack Overflow, where many of our standards originated, the same kind of thing could be said of network packet sniffers, or key loggers. Yeah, they're sometimes used for bad. But maybe you want to know how to write one so that your software can be protected against it. Pretty much anything can be used for bad, but not everything has to be.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On top of that, there's some interpretation of &lt;em&gt;when rules matter&lt;/em&gt;. Stack Exchange is hosted in the United States, so we're bound by some relatively liberal United States laws, but we do host some religiously themed sites, where participants could be put in grave danger by other governments just for participating. I've heard of users taking those risks on the network, just in the interest of teaching and learning about those religions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Committing tax fraud is (to me, at least, not to everyone, granted) far from the same thing as holding different religious beliefs than those in power. So feel free to ignore that last paragraph if you see so fit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So in general, on that front, my interpretation of the rules is something like:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;If it's intrinsically malicious, universally unlawful, or down-right evil, it's our job to get that off the site. Otherwise, assuming it's a well-stated, answerable question, it's fine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Given that standard, I'd say that this question should stay. There's nothing unlawful about having an off-shore account, even if it could then be used unlawfully. Maybe that user is planning to move off-shore, it's not really our place to assume.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the other hand, we have what &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt;, the community, wants.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This one's tougher, and I hope other users will express their opinions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Stack Exchange sites are built and moderated by the community, so if we collectively decide that we'll have no part in fraudulent activities, that's something that we can choose to enforce.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Personally, speaking to the principles that I've seen similar communities hold, it seems to me that the question should stay.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/q/15445285/1270504&quot;&gt;a certain Silk Road developer&lt;/a&gt; got arrested after posting a question on Stack Overflow that led to his identity being leaked. Clearly that's different, and in fact the question wasn't asking for something illegal itself, but it's naïve of any user to ask a question thinking that nobody is watching. I wouldn't personally want to ask a question that was clearly related to illegal activities, but that's just me, but I don't think it's the site's job to stop me from making such bad decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="59" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-05-23T12:38:54.797" LastActivityDate="2015-02-25T03:07:28.710" CommentCount="15" />
  <row Id="225" PostTypeId="1" CreationDate="2015-02-26T11:31:59.010" Score="3" ViewCount="73" Body="&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I stepped by some questions that had some tags I didn't know what they meant. The first example was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/product-market-fit&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;product-market-fit&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, I had no clue whathaheck was that, then I did what I'm used to do in other SE sites: I hovered the mouse over the tag to read its description, unfortunately I found out that there was no tag wiki description for this tag, so I was obliged to look for a description in an external source. I Googled it to find out what it meant.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Navigating a bit more through the site I realized that even the &lt;a href=&quot;https://startups.stackexchange.com/tags&quot;&gt;top tags&lt;/a&gt; are lacking the wiki description. In my opinion, tags are one of the most important mechanism that organizes and guide questioners ans answerers through the content of the site. They are an essential part of the site and we are simply not using them properly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I decided I was going to help the community spending my time filling some blank tag wikis  that I was particularly interested on. I filled three wiki descriptions of tags I really didn't have a clue on what they meant before I Google them, they were:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/product-market-fit&quot;&gt;product-market-fit&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/equity&quot;&gt;equity&lt;/a&gt;; and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/angel-investors&quot;&gt;angel-investors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm adept of the reuse, which means that if someone cared to spend time writing definition of terms before I don't see the need to do it myself all over again. Even more because I believe my writing skills are not really high, so the chances of I write a clear, logical and complete definition of something I didn't know what meant minutes before I Google it, are really low.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So... Yes! I did copy the definitions from Wikipedia :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is that legal? Definitely yes, accordingly to the Wikipedia &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia%3ACopyrights&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;copyright statement&lt;/a&gt;, which says:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The licenses Wikipedia uses grant free access to our content in the same sense that free software is licensed freely. Wikipedia content can be copied, modified, and redistributed if and only if the copied version is made available on the same terms to others and acknowledgment of the authors of the Wikipedia article used is included (a link back to the article is generally thought to satisfy the attribution requirement; see below for more details). Copied Wikipedia content will therefore remain free under appropriate license and can continue to be used by anyone subject to certain restrictions, most of which aim to ensure that freedom. This principle is known as copyleft in contrast to typical copyright licenses.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Does the community want this? Apparently, nobody cared to ask to &lt;strong&gt;this community here&lt;/strong&gt; about. Nevertheless, I had my suggestions rejected despite the general Stack Exchange decision about this subject is: Yes. It is OK to use some Wikipedia statements as tag wiki descriptions, as the below topic:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/79000/229289&quot;&gt;Would it be OK to paste content from Wikipedia into a popular empty tag-wiki?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;PS: one was approved, but right after the mod felt he made a wrong decision and them decided that no description was better than a Wikipedia description and erased my suggestion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So my &lt;strong&gt;main question&lt;/strong&gt; to the community is: Is it really preferable to have &lt;strong&gt;no&lt;/strong&gt; description in the tag wiki instead of having Wikipedia descriptions on them?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is a blank tag wiki description of any help? Will all the users that don't know what one tag means have the same patience I had to go to an external source to read an introductory text about the subject? Will the Wikipedia descriptions move people away from the site?

Three of the four, including the accepted one, ultimately amount to &quot;don't do this.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You're definitely right that Wikipedia licenses its content in a way that is conducive to this behavior, but it's important to remember what the Stack Exchange side feels about it. In fact, I haven't found a single source that speaks to why we'd want copied content here. Everything I've read says one or both of &quot;it's completely legal, and it's completely useless.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I guess the best resource I can cite here is the rejection reason I used:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;This edit copies a significant amount of content from an external source. Generic descriptions such as encyclopedia articles and ad copy do not provide useful guidance; try creating something &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/03/redesigned-tags-page/&quot;&gt;useful to this community &lt;em&gt;specifically&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and be sure to attribute the original author. See: &lt;a href=&quot;https://startups.stackexchange.com/help/referencing&quot;&gt;How to reference material written by others&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The fact that this rejection reason exists in the first place speaks well to the sentiments of Stack Exchange in general. Tag Wikis are meant as a central resource for members of our community. It's awesome that you wanted to contribute to them, but contributions should really be in our own words, and specifically, they should specifically speak to the community itself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Know thy audience. For us, that means tag wikis should, at least, show key relations between the topic at hand and entrepreneurship. Wikipedia is a general resource, and a really good one at that, but it's written for the world, so its phrasing is not as tailored to the community as tag wikis need to be, in order to serve their purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/107378/263510&quot;&gt;Gilles' answer&lt;/a&gt; to the MSE post you cited is really well articulated. There's a specific example in that post, but the last paragraph carries a lot of general weight:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Tag wikis are mainly intended for people who are about to ask a question; they should help those people write better questions, or find answers on their own. An example of something that's useful in a tag wiki for an author is an overview of that author's works; another is a link to a wiki site about that author.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Remember: Stack Exchange is a Q&amp;amp;A network, and the purpose of tags (wikis included) is to support that. As Connor said in his &lt;a href=&quot;https://startups.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/225/is-it-desirable-that-we-fill-empty-wiki-tag-descriptions-with-wikipedia-content#comment1607_225&quot;&gt;comment&lt;/a&gt;, if someone wants to know all of that information, Wikipedia will be their first hit anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Given all that, I'd encourage double-checking the &quot;What Are Tag Wikis?&quot; sidebar.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The full tag wiki is a detailed introduction to the topic, suitable as a destination for those curious about it: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;ul&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;what questions should have this tag?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;some basic definitions&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;brief introduction to the subject&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;important links for learning more&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;one reasonably sized page&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'd encourage anyone who intends to write tag wikis to check over those before submitting. Wikipedia doesn't fulfill many of them. The third point, &quot;brief introduction to the subject,&quot; could be argued either way, but the general consensus seems to be that Wikipedia isn't as brief as we need to be on this. The main goals should be to teach users how to use the tag, and where to find more information.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think of it this way: the tag wiki teaches about a &lt;em&gt;tag&lt;/em&gt;, not a topic.&lt;/strong&gt; To understand a tag, one must differentiate the topic, but beyond that, the purpose is to show how the topic relates and is useful to questions on the site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/03/redesigned-tags-page/&quot;&gt;blog post linked to by many of these&lt;/a&gt; is also very useful in knowing what content deserves an esteemed position in a tag wiki or tag wiki excerpt.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for your &quot;main&quot; question, of whether an empty tag wiki is preferable to a copied one, I would say yes, given everything I've reviewed. A copied one like these takes steps in the wrong direction, and doesn't do anything to help with the actual goal of the wikis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;All that said&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It really is appreciated that you want to add tag wikis, and the issue here is political and social, more than legal, and I know those issues can be difficult to know ahead of time. The ban will be over soon enough, and when it is, I would encourage reading through the UI prompts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tag wikis just have a different purpose than Wikipedia, and while both serve to make the internet a better place, and both serve to give a (generally) brief introduction to a topic, they differ fundamentally in who they're for and what kind of information they work to convey. Linking to Wikipedia, and in some cases even pulling in a sentence or two that are clearly marked as originating from there, can be acceptable. But full paragraph upon paragraph crosses a line.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="59" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:51:27.443" LastActivityDate="2015-02-27T02:52:23.413" CommentCount="2" />

Considering our main goal of the site should be to ask and answer questions, being in the beta phase isn't really all that much of a problem. Stack Exchange isn't going to shut us down if we can continue the level of enthusiasm and quality that we've accomplished so far, and I don't foresee that dropping in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr /&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If I were to offer some critique, and I say this as a regular user, not a moderator, I'm starting to see a lot of what Robert Cartaino, a Stack Exchange employee, said in his post a while back. From &lt;a href=&quot;https://startups.meta.stackexchange.com/q/49/59&quot;&gt;Is this site viable? We&amp;#39;re extending the private beta&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The vast majority of questions seem to be very narrowly focused on the &lt;em&gt;mechanics&lt;/em&gt; of STARTING a business rather than the meatier challenges of &lt;strong&gt;actually running a start-up.&lt;/strong&gt; There's nothing inherently wrong with a few how-to-get-started questions, but right now the &lt;a href=&quot;http://startups.stackexchange.com&quot;&gt;front page&lt;/a&gt; reads more like any chapter-book on &quot;How to Start Your Small Business&quot; rather than something that captures the insightful day-to-day &lt;em&gt;problem-solving&lt;/em&gt; of actually &lt;em&gt;running&lt;/em&gt; a small enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I worry that many of our questions have become about specific implementations of small businesses. I don't mean to call out any questions as being bad, very few are, but in vast quantities, it's hard to build a strong community of askers and answerers around questions like:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ul&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Is &lt;em&gt;[this practice]&lt;/em&gt; legal?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;What does &lt;em&gt;[this passage from a book]&lt;/em&gt; mean?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;What are the steps involved in registering a business?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Those kinds of questions are, while totally valid and generally on-topic, pretty limiting. I would prefer, as Robert suggested, seeing more of the high-level theories expressed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Reviewing our &lt;a href=&quot;https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions?sort=votes&quot;&gt;top questions by votes&lt;/a&gt;, I see a lot of the kinds of questions I love.

How do I approach this?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;None of these questions could be answered by someone reading the Secretary of State website. They require, to one degree or another, the insight of an experienced entrepreneur. They have a certain je ne sais quoi that really sells the community, in my eyes at least, as having a lot to offer. They're not inappropriately subjective, nor are they too broad, but they still present difficult business questions that could have a number of &quot;right&quot; answers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr /&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, of course, I'm not up and arguing that we don't get these questions any more. We do, and they're awesome, but they've slowed down a lot from our founding. I wouldn't be mentioning this if you hadn't asked, but if there was any one thing that I could change about the site, it would be to add more of those kinds of questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I should stress, I take no issue with the more mechanical questions. Those need answers, and I firmly believe that the Stack Exchange model leads here to be among the best places to get those answers. My point isn't to reduce those, so much as to promote the more thought-provoking types.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That all said, I'm really not sure these kinds of questions can be forced.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="59" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:51:27.443" LastActivityDate="2015-03-05T00:05:20.057" CommentCount="2" />

It's straightforward to set up: you can buy lists of 100M+ email addresses for a few bucks and blast away in a completely automated manner.

I strongly disagree. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;As I mentioned in the comments, the question can be interpreted as registering a company name, trademark/copyright law, and anything else that concerns incorporating a company/startup. The name of an App (the startup) can be the &lt;strong&gt;focal point&lt;/strong&gt; of the app. Even in the iOS guidelines, developers are encouraged to choose names that are relevant to their business (app) or they face being rejected by the Apple Store: &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(3.3.3 in the article) &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Apps with names, descriptions, screenshots, or previews not relevant&#xA;  to the content and functionality of the App will be rejected&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Developers are encouraged to chose wisely! Therefore, a question relating to reserving a name is quite important, and to be honest, being a developer I'm very interested if anyone knows if that's even possible. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, there are several questions that relate/are similar to that question (because there are tags deliberately made that make them relatable) and all have been well received and answered by reputable members of the Startup StackExchange site community. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Examples: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/66/is-it-a-must-to-register-the-business-for-internet-based-start-up?rq=1&quot;&gt;Is it a must to register the business for internet based start up?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/804/is-it-okay-to-register-company-app-name-after-app-has-been-released-advertise?rq=1&quot;&gt;Is it okay to register company / app name after app has been released, advertised and has multiple users?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(This question below, which is primarily opinion based, received 4 up votes...

A small growth oriented business isn't a startup. It's just a business. A new startup, its just another way of saying a new business.

It was not without some level of trepidation - Startups had previously been on the network and resulted in closure due to the lack of any remaining moderation hands on the site resulting in its quality dropping. So it was stated when we hit public beta:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Startups SE now has as long as it takes to work through the public beta phase, provided that the site doesn't become a deserted ghost town of run-down buildings full of broken windows.

For months, the moderator team has functionally consisted of a single active individual, who wishes to step down, and others who have been inactive for varyingly large portions of the year and beyond. To combat this, we hosted &lt;a href=&quot;https://startups.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/336/moderator-position-open-nominees-needed&quot;&gt;a call for candidates&lt;/a&gt;. For several weeks, it met with a single volunteer, a user who is relatively new but at least stood forward. And only one downvote in response to the nomination, the closest to any form of acknowledgment of the process. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This led us to do further investigation into the health of the site, and the news was not good. Several bad questions get asked on the main site, maybe get a downvote or two, maybe get a close vote or two, but these result in no actual closures or cleanup. In the worst case scenario, &lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/j4uyo.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; title=&quot;Would link the post but that would require enough rep to see the deleted post&quot;&gt;blatant spam remained on the site, flagged but unaddressed, for four whole days&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The meta site is mostly a ghost town, indicating moreso that there is no real backing on the site. Not only is the meta front page largely consisting of the community user bumping ancient posts, but it dates all the way back to 2015 before you cross halfway into the scroll. It's very reflective in the response we saw in our call for moderation and the lack of care on the main site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We're willing to keep the lights on for a site that's low in activity, as long as the site is being properly taken care of - not just by appointed moderators but also by the community itself.

  <row Id="348" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="345" CreationDate="2017-12-01T20:09:05.963" Score="3" Body="&lt;p&gt;I stepped in as a moderator somewhat late in the game, and understand some of this responsibility is mine. I had a good time discussing issues here as a non-mod member a couple years back but I never felt any meaning coming out of the meta exchange and personally never was able to contribute anything significant to the site's foundation. I go through the queue every now and then but in all honesty there didn't seem to be much new content developing on the exchange that was anything different. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I feel like as a community, our understanding of how startups have changed in the last two years is actually completely missing from the questions that were seen, as such there was never a maturity in questions, but rather the same low level questions were being asked and rarely did we see mature startup community members returning with questions, but simply just mature members providing answers to the same forms of existing problems. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The amount of spam to me was disheartening, specifically people thinking this was a place to advertise their startups via an attempt at an intelligent question. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I wanted to see more development but perhaps through my ignorance and late entry as a moderator I never was able to commit the time to facilitating the change. I am disheartened to see this, but even as I told the stackexchange mod, I would only be checking startups on a weekly basis at best, and had no prior mod experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other than Dennis submitting posts frequently for review, I wasn't seeing the same value being generated by the site (namely: questions) that we originally saw in the past, and perhaps this dim light had a negative impact on my impression of the site as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="43" LastActivityDate="2017-12-01T20:09:05.963" CommentCount="2" />
