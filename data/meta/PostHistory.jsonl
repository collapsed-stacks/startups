This relaunch of Startups SE has certainly captured the energy, enthusiasm, and quantity of activity we like to see in the raw numbers.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, we also have some grave concerns about the scope and direction this site has taken.\r\n\r\nThe vast majority of questions seem to be very narrowly focused on the *mechanics* of STARTING a business rather than the meatier challenges of **actually running a start-up.** There's nothing inherently wrong with a few how-to-get-started questions, but right now the [front page](http://startups.stackexchange.com) reads more like any chapter-book on \"How to Start Your Small Business\" rather than something that captures the insightful day-to-day *problem-solving* of actually *running* a small enterprise. \r\n\r\nMaybe this is a labeling problem. You see \"start-up\" and think \"how to start a business.\" But focusing on such a small (and transient) aspect of entrepreneurship will make it exceedingly difficult to keep the \"do-ers\" in this space. This site has to be interesting to those with the hard-earned expertise to build this community, and I'm afraid this primer on how to launch your new business isn't terribly compelling. \r\n\r\nI'd like to float a personal observation &mdash;\r\n\r\nSmall business management and the challenges we face is certainly a compelling subject. But I'm wondering if we're (inadvertently) encouraging the wrong audience to build this site. Certainly we're not trying to send anyone away&hellip; but rather how to attract the missing chunk of expertise that seems to be missing here &mdash; the active entrepreneurs with the intriguing questions (and insightful answers) that will make this site worth building at all.\r\n\r\nThis is something we have figure out now in private beta.

This isn't to quibble over the actual copy; it's just to set up some basic tenets of where/if to point this site and how to proceed.\r\n\r\n**What do you think?** Critique, omissions, misconceptions? This is to to see if we are on the same basic page. Please discuss:\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n> ##Startups\r\n*A Q&A site for entrepreneurs starting and running a small business*\r\n\r\n> **What topics can I ask about here?**\r\n\r\n> Startups Stack Exchange is for entrepreneurs faced with starting and running a small business under conditions of significant uncertainty. \r\n\r\n> If your question is about&hellip;\r\n\r\n> - Starting a small business including partnership and corporate structures, business plans, finance, legal or IP issues\r\n- Operational issues such as attracting and hiring talent, compensation, employee relationships, training and development\r\n- Strategies for successfully bringing a product or service to market\r\n\r\n> and it's ***not*** about&hellip;\r\n\r\n> - Evaluating your ideas (\"Please review my business\", \"Will this product sell?\")\r\n- General brainstorming (\"I have this idea... what now?\", \"How can I market this?\", \"Help me find a name\", \"Make my website better\")\r\n\r\n> &hellip; then you\u2019re in the right place to ask your question!\r\n\r\n> &lt;etc...>\r\n\r\n---\r\n"}

These moderators are chosen by the StackExchange Community Team rather than being voted on due to the generally small size when the site moves from private to public beta but still really needing some users who can use all the moderator tools.\r\n\r\n## How do you become a provisional moderator for this site?\r\n\r\nSoon after the site launches into \"public beta,\" the Community Team will appoint provisional moderators from this community until the community is ready to hold its own elections (once it graduates from beta).\r\n\r\n**Deep engagement in the community's development** is required for all temporary moderator candidates. All potential candidates must:\r\n\r\n> - Have a reasonably high reputation score to indicate active, consistent participation.\r\n> - Show an interest in their meta\u2019s community-building activities.\r\n> - Lead by example, showing patience and respect for their fellow community members in everything they write.\r\n> - Exhibit those intangible traits discussed in [A Theory of Moderation](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/07/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/).\r\n> \r\n> Bonus points for:\r\n> \r\n> - Members with participation in both meta and the parent site (i.e. interest in both community building and expertise in the field).\r\n> - Area 51 participation, social network referrals, or blogging about the site.\r\n> - Members who have already shown an interest or ability to promote their community.\r\n> \r\n> Candidates will be contacted and three of them will be selected to act\r\n> as provisional Moderators until the community holds formal elections\r\n> after the Beta period. Besides the normal abilities of a Moderator,\r\n> they will:\r\n> \r\n> 1. Have access to a special chat room where we will collectively work through the challenges of moderation and community self-policing.\r\n> 2. Organize the process of selecting the site\u2019s attributes (domain names, design issues, the [help center], etc.).\r\n> 3. Rally community support and drive the mission of getting publicity for the site.\r\n> \r\n> Essentially, **they will have the ear of the Stack Exchange team for\r\n> anything we can do to help their sites succeed!**\r\n\r\n## Nominating users to serve as moderators for the beta\r\n\r\nFor each user that you would like to nominate,\r\n\r\n- post an answer containing the URLs to both of the user's **main and meta profiles on this site**\r\n- optionally, link to the user's **Area 51 profile** or a profile from another site, or add a reason why you'd like him/her to moderate during beta\r\n- **self-nominations** (i.e. posting your own profiles) are allowed and even encouraged\r\n- post each user as a separate answer, and add multiple answers if you wish to nominate multiple users\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if someone nominates *you*, please **edit the answer** to indicate your approval (or declination).

Anyway, let's you and me both suspend disbelief while I paint the picture.\r\n\r\nThe kick-off is a post on meta, asking for ideas for a startup side project. The only criterion is it has to be things that cost zero cash (or piggyback on stuff we'll have sitting around, like hosing).\r\n\r\nOut of this, we have one? two? projects, and a bunch of volunteers who are going to commit a small but meaningful amount of time each week. After a few days or weeks, the project(s) have a landing page: this is like arriving at Go with a top hat and a bank balance.\r\n\r\nThe deal is, each time the team has a major decision to make, even if it's one where there's unanimity, they bring it back as a question. The answer that scores highest (after say 3 days, and subject to a bit of moderation to keep answerers and voters free from the temptation to just make outrageous suggestions) is then what to do next.\r\n\r\nIf a team can't run with the answer, it's bankrupt. Otherwise, it runs on to the next decision to bring back to Startups.SE.\r\n\r\nThe idea isn't to create the world's best startup, but to get some questions that are not only real and timely, but where the answers get applied, and the community gets the next question.\r\n\r\nSo like I say, this is probably a super bad idea. The only merit is, if I heard this was happening somewhere on the Internet, I would want to watch or take part!\r\n\r\nSo, virtual colleagues, ***what about* a Startups.SE startup?**"}

If there are questions clearly in need of legal advice on the site should we be answering them? I'm not talking as much about about questions like 'pros and cons of LLC vs. Sole Proprietor', but more so the questions about legal liability which generally fall into the formula of 'can I do this legally?' or 'can I do this and avoid liability'  \r\n\r\n2. Can users safely speak from personal experience without legal liability on the site?\r\n\r\n3. Should we develop some standard responses/comments to add to questions that clearly need a lawyer to fully answer? For example, if we see a question that clearly needs a lawyer then can we or *should* we try to always add a comment like \"With legal questions it is always good to speak with a lawyer for a more definitive answer as contributors are not all legal experts.\"\r\n\r\nThere is also a [potential migration][1] site destination upcoming?

This was true for both mentioned tags, prior to some edit to the respective questions. \r\n\r\nSo I looked at the list of tags and found a number of tags that are pure abbreviations. I listed them here and added what they (probably) mean:\r\n\r\n* [tag:saas] - 8 questions - *Software as a Service*\r\n* [tag:b2b] - 5 questions - *Business to Business*\r\n* [tag:ux] - 1 question - maybe *User Experience*, but still ambiguous\r\n* [tag:seo] - 1 question - *Search Engine Optimization*\r\n* [tag:baas] - 1 question - *Backend as a Service*\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the [tag:seo] question *could* be retagged to [tag:app-store-optimization], but that is not the point here.\r\n\r\nThese questions, in my opinion, should be retagged to tags with the written-out versions of these tags, to make it more clear what they mean to everyone. Maybe these abbreviations can be added as synonyms to the written-out tags. Also, I can do the retagging, but I did not want to flood the queue (at least not without warning/approval).\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nThere is another tag, probably related to taxes in the USA, which I would like to mention, but I do not know, if there actually is a written-out version for this. If not, I would suggest to add a tag-wiki text to explain what it is about.\r\n\r\n* [tag:83b] - 1 question\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nFinally there are three abbreviation-tags, which are related to the primary topic here. Due to this, I think these abbreviations are fine, but should nevertheless be explained in the tag-wikis.\r\n\r\n* [tag:ceo] - 4 questions - *Chief Executive Officer*\r\n* [tag:ltd] - 3 questions - *Limited* (legal form of a company)\r\n* [tag:gmbh] - 1 question - *Gesellschaft mit beschr\u00e4nkter Haftung* (legal form of a company in Germany)\r\n"}

We'd like for this meta post to serve two purposes: \r\n\r\n1. We hope it will act as a canonical reference *of* canonical references, to make them easier to find for users armed with duplicate close votes, and even just those with general subject interest. \r\n\r\n2. If you feel a topic deserves a canonical reference, feel free to post it as an answer here to gauge community interest and support, or even to recruit a more knowledgeable user to help implement a canonical resource.\r\n\r\nWriting these resources can be very difficult, and it's important to plan them out before posting them (either by answering yourself, or by enlisting help of another before proceeding), as they can easily be viewed as \"too broad\" unless the intent is made clear from the get-go.\r\n\r\nAs I said, this is just an experiment. I'm sure whether a question like this will be helpful in the long run, but we're interested to build a solid foundation now of these types of resources, so that as the site grows we don't find ourselves tangled in a web of mostly-duplicates that could easily share a common, more complete canonical question.\r\n\r\nSo, what would you like to see? What questions do you see asked *over* and *over* that could be broadened up into a wider topic? What canonical resources do we already have that deserve to be documented?"}

If you complete a challenge, like answering questions under certain circumstances or performing edits, you get a little virtual hat to pin on your profile picture for the duration of the event, or if you're handy with screen shots, until the next Winter Bash.\r\n\r\nIt's just another good way to have some fun and share our knowledge.\r\n\r\nParticipation is strictly voluntary, so if you find football helmets and mullets (two \"hats\" from last year) particularly unbecoming, no worries, you'll be able to avoid donning a hat yourself, or even turn off seeing everyone else's.\r\n\r\nParticipation is enabled by default for all sites, but for those where hats might not fit into the vibe they're trying to set up, the Stack Exchange staff do allow us to disable the feature entirely.\r\n\r\nIf we come to a group conclusion that we don't like hats and they shouldn't be enabled, one of us diamond moderators will reach out to the team and request we be taken off the list. Otherwise, you can look forward to this tradition on December 14.\r\n\r\nDo we want hats?"}

A user @Kekito (with all respect) mentioned the he/she voted to close the question because it has nothing to do with startups. I strongly disagree. \r\n\r\n1. As I mentioned in the comments, the question can be interpreted as registering a company name, trademark/copyright law, and anything else that concerns incorporating a company/startup. The name of an App (the startup) can be the **focal point** of the app. Even in the iOS guidelines, developers are encouraged to choose names that are relevant to their business (app) or they face being rejected by the Apple Store: https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/ \r\n\r\n(3.3.3 in the article) \r\n\r\n> Apps with names, descriptions, screenshots, or previews not relevant\r\n> to the content and functionality of the App will be rejected\r\n\r\n2. Developers are encouraged to chose wisely! Therefore, a question relating to reserving a name is quite important, and to be honest, being a developer I'm very interested if anyone knows if that's even possible. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, there are several questions that relate/are similar to that question (because there are tags deliberately made that make them relatable) and all have been well received and answered by reputable members of the Startup StackExchange site community. \r\n\r\nExamples: \r\n\r\n1. http://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/66/is-it-a-must-to-register-the-business-for-internet-based-start-up?rq=1\r\n\r\n2. http://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/804/is-it-okay-to-register-company-app-name-after-app-has-been-released-advertise?rq=1\r\n\r\n3. (This question below, which is primarily opinion based, received 4 up votes... If anything, I would argue that this question is more of a concern)\r\n\r\nhttp://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/4195/should-i-think-of-domain-app-name-first-before-even-going-into-details-of-my-ide?rq=1\r\n\r\nConsidering a lot of the questions on this community concern software startups, closing a question like this could leave a precedent for future software/tech related questions. I even think this question is a GREAT question because it requires a factual and researched: Yes/No response. No opinion. No discussion. Pure fact. \r\n\r\nWe should encourage people to post questions that require those types of answers (As does StackOverFlow and the rest of the communities that I'm apart of).\r\n\r\nWhen should questions be closed? In my opinion (quoting StackExchange) when: \r\n\r\n> This question is completely unclear, incomplete, overly-broad,\r\n> primarily opinion-based or is not about startups as described in the\r\n> help center, and it is unlikely to be fixed via editing.\r\n\r\nSomething that the question above isn't. \r\n\r\nWould love to hear everyone's take on it. \r\n\r\nPS, \r\n\r\nThe title isn't great. Please edit if you can think of something more precise! \r\n"}

A user @Kekito (with all respect) mentioned the he/she voted to close the question because it has nothing to do with startups. I strongly disagree. \r\n\r\n1. As I mentioned in the comments, the question can be interpreted as registering a company name, trademark/copyright law, and anything else that concerns incorporating a company/startup. The name of an App (the startup) can be the **focal point** of the app. Even in the iOS guidelines, developers are encouraged to choose names that are relevant to their business (app) or they face being rejected by the Apple Store: https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/ \r\n\r\n(3.3.3 in the article) \r\n\r\n> Apps with names, descriptions, screenshots, or previews not relevant\r\n> to the content and functionality of the App will be rejected\r\n\r\n2. Developers are encouraged to chose wisely! Therefore, a question relating to reserving a name is quite important, and to be honest, being a developer I'm very interested if anyone knows if that's even possible. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, there are several questions that relate/are similar to that question (because there are tags deliberately made that make them relatable) and all have been well received and answered by reputable members of the Startup StackExchange site community. \r\n\r\nExamples: \r\n\r\n1. https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/66/is-it-a-must-to-register-the-business-for-internet-based-start-up?rq=1\r\n\r\n2. https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/804/is-it-okay-to-register-company-app-name-after-app-has-been-released-advertise?rq=1\r\n\r\n3. (This question below, which is primarily opinion based, received 4 up votes... If anything, I would argue that this question is more of a concern)\r\n\r\nhttps://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/4195/should-i-think-of-domain-app-name-first-before-even-going-into-details-of-my-ide?rq=1\r\n\r\nConsidering a lot of the questions on this community concern software startups, closing a question like this could leave a precedent for future software/tech related questions. I even think this question is a GREAT question because it requires a factual and researched: Yes/No response. No opinion. No discussion. Pure fact. \r\n\r\nWe should encourage people to post questions that require those types of answers (As does StackOverFlow and the rest of the communities that I'm apart of).\r\n\r\nWhen should questions be closed? In my opinion (quoting StackExchange) when: \r\n\r\n> This question is completely unclear, incomplete, overly-broad,\r\n> primarily opinion-based or is not about startups as described in the\r\n> help center, and it is unlikely to be fixed via editing.\r\n\r\nSomething that the question above isn't. \r\n\r\nWould love to hear everyone's take on it. \r\n\r\nPS, \r\n\r\nThe title isn't great. Please edit if you can think of something more precise! \r\n"}

If your technical question is actually a business question, that's alright. But if you just want to know what tech stack you should pick for some given use-case, we aren't the best place to get that information.\r\n\r\nTo emphasize these cases, we (your moderators) have introduced a new close vote reason:\r\n\r\n> Questions seeking technical advice **(\"What tech stack should I use?\")** are off-topic because they attract opinionated answers, and require a skill-set outside the scope of this site. Please see [\"Can we discuss queries related to start up tech stack here?\"](http://meta.startups.stackexchange.com/q/290)\r\n\r\nThere will be some overlap, for sure, between this and our existing [tools recommendations](http://meta.startups.stackexchange.com/q/102/59) reason, but we believe that calling out this specific type of question is warranted.\r\n\r\nIt may someday be the case that we merge the reasons in favor of a new, unrelated off-topic reason, but given the state of things as they are, I think having these be separated out will help provide more clarity to new users.\r\n\r\nThis is now live, and you can use it whenever appropriate. Along with our recommendation and [brainstorming](http://meta.startups.stackexchange.com/questions/114/new-vote-to-close-reason) messages, this will appear under Close -> off-topic because.... when casting a close vote. If none of these reasons fit, you can still create your own off-topic message.\r\n\r\nWhile the change is live, we still definitely welcome feedback. Feel free to propose alternate wording, or even another reason altogether. We're definitely open to iterating on these items as the site matures."}

If your technical question is actually a business question, that's alright. But if you just want to know what tech stack you should pick for some given use-case, we aren't the best place to get that information.\r\n\r\nTo emphasize these cases, we (your moderators) have introduced a new close vote reason:\r\n\r\n> Questions seeking technical advice **(\"What tech stack should I use?\")** are off-topic because they attract opinionated answers, and require a skill-set outside the scope of this site. Please see [\"Can we discuss queries related to start up tech stack here?\"](https://startups.meta.stackexchange.com/q/290)\r\n\r\nThere will be some overlap, for sure, between this and our existing [tools recommendations](https://startups.meta.stackexchange.com/q/102/59) reason, but we believe that calling out this specific type of question is warranted.\r\n\r\nIt may someday be the case that we merge the reasons in favor of a new, unrelated off-topic reason, but given the state of things as they are, I think having these be separated out will help provide more clarity to new users.\r\n\r\nThis is now live, and you can use it whenever appropriate. Along with our recommendation and [brainstorming](https://startups.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/114/new-vote-to-close-reason) messages, this will appear under Close -> off-topic because.... when casting a close vote. If none of these reasons fit, you can still create your own off-topic message.\r\n\r\nWhile the change is live, we still definitely welcome feedback. Feel free to propose alternate wording, or even another reason altogether. We're definitely open to iterating on these items as the site matures."}

I don't see how it should prevent a Marketing SE from forming unless they expand their scope \r\nto be \"Businesses\"\r\n\r\nAnd from another discussion on the same proposal it discusses ProWebmaster's covering SEO, to which I replied:\r\n\r\n>-----\r\n\r\n>Every time a Marketing Proposal appears it gets attacked because some other SE's have rudimentary marketing on topic. SEO for example is on topic in a few places - that's hardly marketing.\r\n\r\n>In traditional marketing terms, there's no such thing as Internet Marketing.\r\n\r\n>Internet is a medium. Your website is Advertising. Facebook or Google or any other site are channels.\r\n\r\n>You contact Sports Illustrated wanting to run an advertisement. Sports Illustrated is the channel. Their email campaigns, list rentals, print magazines, digital publications, etc are all mediums.\r\n\r\n>Then there's TV advertising, radio advertising, corporate sponsorships, public relations, brand influencers, etc. That's just in the Promotion realm of the P's.\r\n\r\n>There's also Price setting, Promotional opportunities, and Place (distribution of goods and services) to consider. None of these are on topic anywhere.\r\n\r\nSo my questions to you all are:\r\n\r\n1. What definition have you all settled on for startups? \r\n2.

It was not without some level of trepidation - Startups had previously been on the network and resulted in closure due to the lack of any remaining moderation hands on the site resulting in its quality dropping. So it was stated when we hit public beta:\r\n\r\n> Startups SE now has as long as it takes to work through the public beta phase, provided that the site doesn't become a deserted ghost town of run-down buildings full of broken windows. Put simply, *unless we see the site overrun with extremely poor quality questions and spam, and no one doing anything about it, you've got a site*.\r\n\r\nI'm afraid to announce that we've run into the latter case. For months, the moderator team has functionally consisted of a single active individual, who wishes to step down, and others who have been inactive for varyingly large portions of the year and beyond. To combat this, we hosted [a call for candidates](https://startups.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/336/moderator-position-open-nominees-needed). For several weeks, it met with a single volunteer, a user who is relatively new but at least stood forward. And only one downvote in response to the nomination, the closest to any form of acknowledgment of the process. \r\n\r\nThis led us to do further investigation into the health of the site, and the news was not good. Several bad questions get asked on the main site, maybe get a downvote or two, maybe get a close vote or two, but these result in no actual closures or cleanup. In the worst case scenario, [blatant spam remained on the site, flagged but unaddressed, for four whole days](https://i.stack.imgur.com/j4uyo.png \"Would link the post but that would require enough rep to see the deleted post\"). \r\n\r\nThe meta site is mostly a ghost town, indicating moreso that there is no real backing on the site. Not only is the meta front page largely consisting of the community user bumping ancient posts, but it dates all the way back to 2015 before you cross halfway into the scroll. It's very reflective in the response we saw in our call for moderation and the lack of care on the main site.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWe're willing to keep the lights on for a site that's low in activity, as long as the site is being properly taken care of - not just by appointed moderators but also by the community itself. With neither being at the presence required, it causes the site to fall apart. As such, **this site will be closed on December 11th**. After that point, the site's content will be available via data dump. \r\n\r\nThank you to everyone who had participated in Startups Stack Exchange for the past 3 years. \r\n"}

If you have loads of meetings and require board member or shareholder approval to get things done then most startups will probably not even get off the ground. I don't know if crowdfunded personal projects are included, but many of them do develop into startup companies.\r\n\r\nThe second is to do with the more organic/non-traditional nature of working relationships between people. There may not be a strict employer-employee relationship, and some people are expected to take on multiple roles beyond what the job description may require. There are also many different types of networking and collaboration models that can co-exist, so people have to be more flexible and willing to give if they want to get something in return.\r\n\r\nI think these are the key differences between working in a startup versus being in an established company. In some ways some startups never move away from that original model that they work in (but it means that their size probably can't grow or scale as well), so there are definitely characteristics that we need to establish so that we get the right audience and discussion happening here."}

They are normally doing it in a way no one else currently tries to solve that problem.\r\n\r\nYou can add all kinds of attributes around what a typical start-up does, e.g. Lean Methodologies or gets seed funding etc but all of those factors can be interchanged. Some start-ups are heavily invested in, others are bootstrapped, how they solve the problem varies greatly.\r\n\r\nA start-up as compared to a small business is what I think we need to define to differentiate this site. A small business is just servicing a need in the market place but not necessarily solving a problem in a new way. E.g. a newsagent is servicing their local area but it is the same as all others. A start-up would do something different to service this area and disrupt the market in some way."}

Meaning that some of the time, the answerer might need a location, but by the time the location is added the question got old and no one particularly cares about it, anymore. I also think that location is necessary all the times, because someone from the Users that is answering might be familiar with the laws of that area and would therefore be more helpful with helping someone from Peoria, Illinois than someone from China or Australia would be. \r\n\r\n***Disclaimer:***\r\n\r\nThe only reason I would say don't add your location, is that someone might decide to stalk you or whatever.

I think the reason is that people who have already started, don't get enough time to contribute. We have people here who are yet to start, and that is how the site is shaping!\r\n\r\nHow can we resolve this? While the course of further expanding of the site, new users getting in, this will automatically get blurred. **And we can see that difference from the first day till here...** We are, and we will mature. This is no time to take our chips down. Please don't get discouraged by this.\r\n\r\n>2) Activity level?\r\n\r\nThat again will rise up substantially in coming future. I have seen a great leap in the activity levels once the site switches from private to public, specially due to HNQs. I understand you have some marks which a private beta is expected to reach, but I sincerely hope that we will do great with this extension period.\r\n\r\n>3) The name?\r\n\r\nNo, please. Lets not change the name. Not even if it is expected to \"fix\" the site. People need to understand that \"Start-up\" is not just a \"start\" up. It is just an immature form of a big business. If someone can't understand that, the site will make sure they do. Maybe the site description can be adjusted to suit that a bit.\r\n\r\nThank you :)"}

You see \"start-up\" and think \"how to start a business.\"  But focusing on such a small (and transient) aspect of entrepreneurship will make it exceedingly difficult to keep the \"do-ers\" in this space. This site has to be interesting to those with the hard-earned expertise to build this community, and I'm afraid this primer on how to launch your new business isn't terribly compelling.\r\n\r\nI disagree: I think that some people who work *with* startup business, including advisers (lawyers/accountants/consultants/bankers) and investors (business \"angels\"/venture capitalists), may see some value to contributing to this site *even if it is* merely a \"a primer on how to launch your business\".\r\n\r\nHowever, I don't think that's a very fair analysis of the site to date.  Of the 87 questions that have been asked so far, I count just 38 that are relevant only to businesses that have not yet begun: the remaining 49 are, to some degree, applicable to established businesses.\r\n\r\nTherefore I reject the premise that underlies your concerns.\r\n\r\n> Small business management and the challenges we face is certainly a compelling subject. But I'm wondering if we're (inadvertently) encouraging the wrong audience to build this site. Certainly we're not trying to send anyone away\u2026 but rather how to attract the missing chunk of expertise that seems to be missing here \u2014 the active entrepreneurs with the intriguing questions (and insightful answers) that will make this site worth building at all.\r\n\r\nI don't dispute that broadening the site's remit to small business generally might indeed appeal to/retain a larger number of \"active entrepreneurs with intriguing questions (and insightful answers)\".    As detailed above, I do dispute that *not doing so* will make the site not \"worth building at all\".\r\n\r\nBut I do have my own concerns that a remit such as \"small business generally\" is so broad that the site might end up with no focus whatsoever.  If it is SE's view that the site really cannot survive in its current form, then I agree that the site's objectives and target audience must be urgently decided."}

However, that said, I don't expect it to go to [tag:status-completed] any time soon, for a couple reasons.\r\n\r\n**Priorities**\r\n\r\nSupporting a site the magnitude of the Stack Exchange network is inherently, well, hard, and there are other things going on that need more urgent addressing. Realistically, if you're concerned about your identity getting out there and an involved party becoming aware of your stance, you could either create another account with a separate email or clear your real account of any personally identifiable information. Now, of course, neither of those are as nice as having the feature implemented. And again, I'm in support of your idea. I just don't think that \"syntactic sugar,\" to use a coding metaphor, is at the top of the list to the SE team right now.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Risk-Reward**\r\n\r\nSpeaking in terms, again, of the network as a whole, we have to look at the philosophy: do we want good questions, or do we *not* want *bad* questions? Allowing for anonymous posting would lead to a lot of bad questions and straight-up spam. Now, I recognize, of course, that that's easy to combat post-facto. We can easily require authentication, then just hide the user information on the post. Then we'd follow the exact same rules as we do now, with close votes leading to blocked posting abilities and all that good stuff.\r\n\r\nBut unfortunately, and this is really just a guess, I'd expect us to have to close a lot more questions, because people wouldn't feel accountable. I see a lot more bad questions posted by @user0000000 than I do by someone with their full name listed, and I'm virtually positive that that problem would just increase if we allowed for true anonymity.\r\n\r\nOf course, to combat my own point, we could require a minimum reputation--have it as a privilege. That would inherently reduce some of the anonymity, but it would work. But I've still seen some pretty embarrassingly bad questions asked by users on Stack Overflow with over ten thousand rep points.\r\n\r\n**Reputation**\r\n\r\nMuch of the brilliance of the Stack Exchange system lies in the accountability we all experience when posting something, because--less on Meta sites--it has a lasting effect on a score that is always displayed near our name. It seems a little weird, then, that someone could write an awesome question or [answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/11227902/1270504) (that link isn't really relevant, since it'd never be posted anonymously, but I still think it's cool--call me a Stack Exchange nerd, I can take it), get almost thirteen *thousand* up-votes that add up to (200-point cap permitting) 130,000 points, but when you go to the person's profile it only shows a couple mediocre answers adding up to a couple hundred points. Obviously that's an extreme example, but you see my point.

However, that said, I don't expect it to go to [tag:status-completed] any time soon, for a couple reasons.\r\n\r\n**Priorities**\r\n\r\nSupporting a site the magnitude of the Stack Exchange network is inherently, well, hard, and there are other things going on that need more urgent addressing. Realistically, if you're concerned about your identity getting out there and an involved party becoming aware of your stance, you could either create another account with a separate email or clear your real account of any personally identifiable information. Now, of course, neither of those are as nice as having the feature implemented. And again, I'm in support of your idea. I just don't think that \"syntactic sugar,\" to use a coding metaphor, is at the top of the list to the SE team right now.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Risk-Reward**\r\n\r\nSpeaking in terms, again, of the network as a whole, we have to look at the philosophy: do we want good questions, or do we *not* want *bad* questions? Allowing for anonymous posting would lead to a lot of bad questions and straight-up spam. Now, I recognize, of course, that that's easy to combat post-facto. We can easily require authentication, then just hide the user information on the post. Then we'd follow the exact same rules as we do now, with close votes leading to blocked posting abilities and all that good stuff.\r\n\r\nBut unfortunately, and this is really just a guess, I'd expect us to have to close a lot more questions, because people wouldn't feel accountable. I see a lot more bad questions posted by @user0000000 than I do by someone with their full name listed, and I'm virtually positive that that problem would just increase if we allowed for true anonymity.\r\n\r\nOf course, to combat my own point, we could require a minimum reputation--have it as a privilege. That would inherently reduce some of the anonymity, but it would work. But I've still seen some pretty embarrassingly bad questions asked by users on Stack Overflow with over ten thousand rep points.\r\n\r\n**Reputation**\r\n\r\nMuch of the brilliance of the Stack Exchange system lies in the accountability we all experience when posting something, because--less on Meta sites--it has a lasting effect on a score that is always displayed near our name. It seems a little weird, then, that someone could write an awesome question or [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/11227902/1270504) (that link isn't really relevant, since it'd never be posted anonymously, but I still think it's cool--call me a Stack Exchange nerd, I can take it), get almost thirteen *thousand* up-votes that add up to (200-point cap permitting) 130,000 points, but when you go to the person's profile it only shows a couple mediocre answers adding up to a couple hundred points. Obviously that's an extreme example, but you see my point. Something like that could happen if someone posted anonymously a lot, even just a few good posts (which I imagine many anonymous ones would be, since they'd be inherently \"meaty\") could lead to a thousand rep points, that would then be left unaccounted for on a profile page.\r\n\r\nNow, my immediate retort to that is \"well then, you just don't get rep points for an anonymous post!\" Fair enough, but does that give us an excuse to just go on and post [not-so-hot](https://stackoverflow.com/q/3905734/1270504) questions on the long-shot that someone will answer, comfortable that we won't get penalized?

I signed up yesterday at StackExchange, only because I stumbled upon this exact forum. The name 'Startup' is very broad, which I believe is good to attract a broad audience. However, I think it is questionable as to whether or not this forum only attracts people dealing with 'small businesses' as many startups can be quite big. Again, this depends on the definition of a startup (some people say you are a startup until you validate a repeatable and scalable business model, some say you are a startup until an exit strategy is executed)."}

We're still in our initial 90 day period, while the previous site had been going for a few years. The other site is going to beat us in all counting stats.\r\n\r\nI'm not trying to make excuses for our metrics, they definitely are lower than where they should be, but they aren't the end-all be-all. What Stack Exchange looks for is a community they think can be self-sustaining. It can't be captured in a few metrics, and they felt that after a few years the previous proposal had deteriorated too much to ever be viable.\r\n\r\nIt's worth looking to see where how we compare to our peers.\r\n\r\n**Startups (80 days)**\r\n\r\n- 3.1 questions per day\r\n- 93% answered\r\n- 44 avid users\r\n- 1,127 total users\r\n-2.3 answer ratio\r\n- 116 visits/day\r\n\r\n**5 most recent beta sites:**\r\n\r\nEmacs (25 days)\r\n\r\n- 14.3 questions per day\r\n- 95% answered\r\n- 74 avid users\r\n- 1,147 total users\r\n- 2.1 answer ratio\r\n- 817 visits/day\r\n\r\n\r\nWorldbuilding (32 days)\r\n\r\n- 10 questions per day\r\n- 99% answered\r\n- 104 avid users\r\n- 1,234 total users\r\n- 3.9 answer ratio\r\n- 2,975 visits/day\r\n\r\n\r\nModerators (81 days)\r\n\r\n- 1.1 questions per day\r\n- 100% answered\r\n- 62 avid users\r\n- 648 total users\r\n- 2.8 answer ratio\r\n- 49 visits/day\r\n\r\nHinduism (122 days)\r\n\r\n- 3.7 questions per day\r\n- 82% answered\r\n- 72 avid users\r\n- 930 total users\r\n- 1.9 answer ratio\r\n- 1,182 visits/day\r\n\r\n\r\n**Business Betas**\r\n\r\nQuantative Finance (1356 days)\r\n\r\n- 3.6 questions per day\r\n- 80% answered\r\n- 317 avid users\r\n- 7,055 total users\r\n- 2.0 answer ratio\r\n- 3,073 visits/day\r\n\r\nBitcoin (1144 days)\r\n\r\n- 5.1 questions per day\r\n- 87% answered\r\n- 385 avid users\r\n- 13,158 total users\r\n- 1.8 answer ratio\r\n- 5,458 visits/day\r\n\r\nProject Management (1348 days)\r\n\r\n- 1.4 questions per day\r\n- 99% answered\r\n- 278 avid users\r\n- 9,222 total users\r\n- 3.7 answer ratio\r\n- 3,517 visits/day\r\n\r\nWhile Emacs and Worldbuilding are off to great starts, those aren't the norm. Emacs had a very active and quick startup process which [helps alot][1], while the startups proposal took a few months to pick up steam, so many of our committers (93.9%) have not followed through on their commitment.\r\n\r\nOne of the advantages Worldbuilding has over us, is that it produces hot questions. Questions with funny titles like [How do I drug a population in the most efficient way?][2] bring a lot of curious traffic to the site. I think I've only seen one or two startups questions appear as hot network questions. https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/260/better-to-learn-programming-or-hire-a-programmer was probably an interesting hot question, because much of the Stack Exchange network is about programming.\r\n\r\nIt looks like all of the business proposals can build up a large mass of users and do well with views per day, but even after years of beta still struggle with questions per day. If we continue at this pace, we'd likely end up like one of those sites. \r\n\r\nI don't have a specific plan for improving our sites metrics, but a few general ideas.\r\n\r\n**Increase Site Scope**\r\n\r\nWe've had some discussions dating back the the initial proposal on whether the startsups definition was too strict and vague. https://startups.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/92/is-our-name-appropriate never really gained much traction though. We allow questions from all businesses, regardless of whether or not they consider themselves a startup, as long as it's on-topic for the site. The site name may disuade potential users though.\r\n\r\n**Attract New Users**\r\n\r\nThis is what the advertising post is trying to achieve. Even if we don't appear on the hot network questions, we can still have sidebar ads on other sites.\r\n\r\nSome other ideas may be promoting this site with other startup communities.\r\n\r\n**Community Building Events**\r\n\r\nAs we get new users, how do we keep them involved? Right now our chat room is pretty quiet most days. One idea could be to have some sort of \"Show Startups\" event, where everyone gets a chance to show off what they've been working on.\r\n\r\nSorry if this is all jumbled, I just wanted to get some thoughts out there.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/143952/what-currently-makes-an-area-51-proposal-successful-and-what-should-make-it-suc/236870#236870\r\n  [2]: https://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/questions/843/how-do-i-drug-a-population-in-the-most-efficient-way"}

If you see a single user doing that a lot (a few times, anyway), you could custom-flag one of their posts and let us know. Just be sure to include whatever supporting evidence you can--other posts, comment threads, chat conversations, meta posts, etc..\r\n\r\nAs you may be aware, there're tons and tons of meta discussions out there about what a \"Not an Answer\" flag actually means. It's primarily an issue on bigger sites, but basically, over-worked moderators with thousands of pending flags don't want to be bothered (with good reason) by having to read through every single answer anyone ever disagrees with (whether it's obvious or not why they do). The precedent we currently work under seems to be that \"not an answer\" is used for \"Thanks!\" or \"Did you ever get this working?\" If an answer makes an honest attempt to answer *a question*, NAA probably isn't appropriate for that.\r\n\r\nIn certain circumstances, flagging as Very Low Quality might be appropriate. That's a tough one, of course, because not all posts like that actually *are* very low quality, as you've said, but that's appropriate for relatively short or obvious cases that you're talking about. It's really more a subjective matter there than anything, but it depends on how clear the post will be to reviewers."}

If the answer is largely orthogonal (pure spam, say), downvotes and other measures are there. Otherwise, answers, upvoting and acceptance are the right tools. \r\n\r\nUpvotes help identify the wisdom of the crowd, so that the most supported answer is right there at the top.\r\n\r\nAcceptance signals the questioner's personal verdict of best answer, with that lovely green tick. \r\n\r\nAnd where an answer prompts someone else to add a better one, that's a sign of the SE model in healthy action. A spot-on answer that's hard to follow will prompt a new, clearly expressed answer, just as if the only answer isn't an answer at all, the invitation to the community through the unanswered questions view remains."}

The general consensus is that' it's okay to poke the person a bit, as long as you're subtle.\r\n\r\nAccepted answers help everyone, so as long as your comment addresses that and doesn't sound like \"give me my fifteen rep points!\" you'll probably be fine.\r\n\r\nThe accepted answer on that particular post is pretty harsh, saying that you should never leave such a comment if the person has ever accepted an answer in the past, since that means they know how and might have chosen against it. I'm not completely sure I agree on that, but the sentiment is true. It's really just a judgment call. When in doubt, I'd advise against commenting. But if you're pretty sure the person meant to and forgot, and they're \"pretty new\" (I'll leave that up to interpretation) to the system, that's okay.\r\n\r\nSometimes people take a long time to accept answers (because they want to explore options or they're just slow at such things), so it's generally good to give them some time, even after they comment. I'd also be much more hesitant if there were a couple answers given, because sometimes the user will go through and comment on each, then accept one that you might not have thought was better than yours. In that event, of course, you wouldn't want to comment.\r\n\r\nIn this particular case, yeah, I think it's probably alright to, as you have, comment and ask the person. In the future, I'd be tempted to include a link to the FAQ post [\"How does accepting an answer work?\"](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5234/how-does-accepting-an-answer-work), just because that gives the person a resource and makes it a bit more about teaching.\r\n\r\nIf I were to leave such a comment, it'd probably look something like this:\r\n\r\n> Awesome! I'm glad I could help. Is there anything else I can help with, or does that answer your question?

The idea was a slick way to add value to existing hashtags, with the idea of creating an API for twitter apps - which at the time were multiplying.\r\n\r\nThat gap has long since closed, but at the same time the hashtag has grown from strength to strength across channels. (Oh, and three of the five founders went on to found and fund other startups.)\r\n\r\nI have a few sketchy ideas about interesting markets. For instance, indie production companies are keen to build long tail value for niche shows and channels; fans are often highly motivated to build community around interesting content; bridging the two could be a great bootstrap, because you only need one show or channel to get started, you don't need to ask permission, it's inherently simple to scrape initial content into the back end, and focusing on strong existing content lowers the bar in terms of what needs to be added to the UX day one.\r\n\r\nHowever, I want to stress that I'm not wedded to that idea. If this team goes forward, it will be something funky to enhance the humble hashtag."}

We aren't quite so technical here, partially because we simply can't be (business questions aren't the same as code questions), but the same theory applies. Tell answerers what they need to know to give an awesome answer, but don't whittle away the hours explaining everything you learned in business school.\r\n\r\nTake a look at the [top-voted questions](https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions) on our site so far. Here are the (currently) top three:\r\n\r\n* [Better to learn programming, or hire a programmer?](https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/260/better-to-learn-programming-or-hire-a-programmer)\r\n* [Dividing profits amongst developers and designers](https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/2/dividing-profits-amongst-developers-and-designers)\r\n* [I have a great idea, but I'm not great at marketing or sales. How do I approach this?](https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/17/i-have-a-great-idea-but-im-not-great-at-marketing-or-sales-how-do-i-approach)\r\n\r\nLooking at them, it's clear that, while they're all great and interesting questions, not one of them divulges the actual business processes they're talking about. At most, they say something along the lines of \"I'd like to write an app.\"\r\n\r\n**Not every great question needs to include every detail that led up to its relevance.**\r\n\r\nIf your question pertains very specifically to the very specific circumstances you're facing, there's a good chance that your question could be made a bit broader to fit more people anyway.\r\n\r\nSometimes--normally, even--this isn't the easiest part. It's often easier (for us as askers, at least) to spit out our questions verbatim just as we're thinking about them. That's not what makes a good question here. What makes a good question is thinking through your question and bringing it down to its bare minimum. Finding relevant aspects of your situation is a task on its own, and sometimes it's hard to know what's relevant and what's not. But that's how great questions (and, in turn, answers) are formed.\r\n\r\nThere's a big difference between \"this question is too broad\" and \"what are the last four digits of your social security number and the name of your first childhood pet?\" and it's important to find and focus on that difference.\r\n\r\nIf you do run through all of this and you're still worried that you're divulging too much, as I led with, this might just not be a great place to ask that question. In business, we make a ton of decisions every day, and not all of them are completely crowd-source-able.\r\n\r\nThe best not-always-obvious solution I have for you in those edge-edge cases, where the issue is more in the hands of \"I'm going to say something in my question that could offend someone I know in real life if they knew I asked it, but it's an important and on-topic question,\" is creating a second account. There's something of a misconception with some, where people believe it's against SE rules to have more than one account. This is not the case. What's against the rules is using a secondary account to game the system--award rep, cast multiple close-votes, etc.--but using a second account to make posts anonymous is completely fine.\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I don't think there is one right answer to this. And I agree that it's definitely a difficult line to find. But it's really just a judgement call that we have to make when posting questions. It has to be decided on a case-by-case basis, and you have to think about the risk-reward scenario you're setting up."}

Here are the (currently) top three:\r\n\r\n* [Better to learn programming, or hire a programmer?](https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/260/better-to-learn-programming-or-hire-a-programmer)\r\n* [Dividing profits amongst developers and designers](https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/2/dividing-profits-amongst-developers-and-designers)\r\n* [I have a great idea, but I'm not great at marketing or sales. How do I approach this?](https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/17/i-have-a-great-idea-but-im-not-great-at-marketing-or-sales-how-do-i-approach)\r\n\r\nLooking at them, it's clear that, while they're all great and interesting questions, not one of them divulges the actual business processes they're talking about. At most, they say something along the lines of \"I'd like to write an app.\"\r\n\r\n**Not every great question needs to include every detail that led up to its relevance.**\r\n\r\nIf your question pertains very specifically to the very specific circumstances you're facing, there's a good chance that your question could be made a bit broader to fit more people anyway.\r\n\r\nSometimes--normally, even--this isn't the easiest part. It's often easier (for us as askers, at least) to spit out our questions verbatim just as we're thinking about them. That's not what makes a good question here. What makes a good question is thinking through your question and bringing it down to its bare minimum. Finding relevant aspects of your situation is a task on its own, and sometimes it's hard to know what's relevant and what's not. But that's how great questions (and, in turn, answers) are formed.\r\n\r\nThere's a big difference between \"this question is too broad\" and \"what are the last four digits of your social security number and the name of your first childhood pet?\" and it's important to find and focus on that difference.\r\n\r\nIf you do run through all of this and you're still worried that you're divulging too much, as I led with, this might just not be a great place to ask that question. In business, we make a ton of decisions every day, and not all of them are completely crowd-source-able.\r\n\r\nThe best not-always-obvious solution I have for you in those edge-edge cases, where the issue is more in the hands of \"I'm going to say something in my question that could offend someone I know in real life if they knew I asked it, but it's an important and on-topic question,\" is creating a second account. There's something of a misconception with some, where people believe it's against SE rules to have more than one account. This is not the case. What's against the rules is using a secondary account to game the system--award rep, cast multiple close-votes, etc.--but using a second account to make posts anonymous is completely fine.\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I don't think there is one right answer to this. And I agree that it's definitely a difficult line to find. But it's really just a judgement call that we have to make when posting questions. It has to be decided on a case-by-case basis, and you have to think about the risk-reward scenario you're setting up."}

The process has changed a lot since Area 51 began and is [long overdue][1] for a rehaul. Stack Exchange has a much different system for graduating sites these days.\r\n\r\nThose stats are still useful for a quick look at the health of a site though. The questions per day is the probably the statistic I look at most. It's easy to see how any one day is relative to the average. For example, yesterday we got 4 questions, so the average is improving slightly. The counting stats will increase with time, and views will come with more questions. Our questions per day average seems to fluctuate between 2-6, which slightly less than half of the goal of 10 per day, but it doesn't put us in the dead site category.\r\n\r\nIt's telling that our worst stats are labeled \"Needs Work\". Stack Exchange is not branding Startups as a failing site, but rather one that isn't ready to stand on its own yet.\r\n\r\nAs blunders pointed out we're fairly comparable to our peer betas. There are some doing much better and some doing much worse. We don't have the statistics to graduate right now, but very few sites are able to graduate in under a year. I elaborated a bit on this in https://startups.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/123/what-can-we-do-to-double-the-sites-utility-then-double-it-again/124#124\r\n\r\nThere are definitely improvements to be made however. Like you mentioned, more questions and more users would help greatly, the issue is those are a little harder to obtain.

Everyone here, I figure, holds that common goal. \"Awesome content\" is hard to define, and indeed if you point at a post, one person might say \"yeah!\" as another is running in fear, but ultimately there are some standards that Stack Exchange has put forth about how we want the site to look and feel, and there are some commonalities on which pretty well anyone who cares will agree.\r\n\r\nMy personal hesitation with recommendation posts of this kind is that they don't always turn into awesome content.\r\n\r\n#Me being critical\r\n\r\nI came across a post the other day, and I'm not linking to it because that's irrelevant, but here's the actual, full quote:\r\n\r\n> ##Computer Generated Content\r\n>I need a piece of software that will scan multiple websites (of the user's choosing) and write a short informative piece about the topic. I need it to be compatible with Mac or Linux and be moderately quick.\r\n\r\n>[tag:linux] [tag:osx]\r\n\r\nThat's not awesome content. Granted, of course, it was put on hold within two hours of being posted, but you see my point. I'm assuming that the asker of this question felt that that was enough. We're small business owners here, so most of us probably know: sometimes people have a difficult time accurately conveying their needs.\r\n\r\nI don't want to see our homepage flooded with questions like this. I'm not saying that's going to happen, but it's a risk.\r\n\r\nBeyond that, there's the simple nature of off-site resources: they're, well, off-site. Because of that:\r\n\r\n* They're not self-contained, and I have to click a link to ensure validity of an answer.\r\n* They'll mostly expire eventually, either in accuracy or direct content (some new software blows the suggestion out of the water, or the suggestion goes out of business).\r\n\r\nOn top of that, they're generally fairly opinion-based, whether they have to be or not.\r\n\r\nIn short, software and tools requests require a different type of moderation (by users and us diamonded folks) than other posts. That's okay, but it's an investment we have to be ready to take on as a collective site, and it's something we want to make sure we're *into* before we jump too fast.\r\n\r\nBeyond that, too, I want to make sure we don't dilute posts that *don't* need off-site resources. For example, imagine I asked the question \"http://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/1713/how-can-i-retain-customers-for-my-seasonal-business\" and got the answer \"I know of an awesome ad platform that will target customers for repeat business, here's the link.\" Right now, that would be a not-so-hot answer to a question that could (and did) get a good, full, self-contained one. But by opening ourselves up to full-on \"what software does *[this]*?\" questions, that becomes a less unacceptable answer.\r\n\r\nClearly that's something of a convoluted concern, because one bad answer doesn't mean any fewer good ones in theory, but in practice I worry that it could.\r\n\r\n#Me being supportive\r\n\r\nAll that said, we aim to help startups and small business owners, and startups and small business owners often need software.\r\n\r\nThat wasn't such a mouthful. But I think it's really important. We sure don't want to shut out questions that would be helpful, since if we start doing that, we're kind of circumventing our central goal here.\r\n\r\n#The current state of things\r\n\r\nFeeling like I haven't even kind of answered the question here? Me too.\r\n\r\nWell, here goes.\r\n\r\nI'll let you, and anyone else who reads this, in on a little secret: that vote to close reason I mentioned a while ago? We haven't really been using it much. We've fallen into non-enforcement with this, and I can't say I totally dig it. We, your moderator team, has been more or less leaving these sorts of questions up to the community to do with as you will. That's cool and all, but it's not consistent, which is an important part of community development.\r\n\r\nI can only really speak for myself on this, but when I see an awesomely researched and put together question, I don't want to close it, and I won't. If it's only boarder-line-relevant to startups, I'll push it over to our friends at [Software Recommendations](http://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com) (a site that's actually devoted to these types of requests), but if I think it's going to be useful to visitors in the future and it's put together well, I'll leave it.\r\n\r\nBut that's all super unofficial. Technically, again, anyone would be right to close that question.\r\n\r\nSo I guess I have two answers for you:\r\n\r\n 1. No, those questions would be off-topic...\r\n 2. ...unless you phrase it right.\r\n\r\nWe'll be looking into options over the next little while to better-phrase that vote-to-close reason to better reflect the real goal (we want those questions, just only if they're really about startups and well put together and answerable in an objective way).\r\n\r\nIf you have suggestions about how we can convey that in an effective way, or if you'd like to take part in the discussion over the validity of these questions and whether they should be welcome here, I'll urge you over to [that previously listed post](http://meta.startups.stackexchange.com/questions/102/vote-to-close-recommendation-posts?lq=1). Feel free to post an answer and say \"Hey, Matthew, man, this is awful. We need those kinds of posts and they're useful and I love them and I love asking and answering them and I need them in my life!\" or \"I hate them, I hate them, I hate them! I never want to see one of these questions again!\" We haven't viewed this as a super, super high priority because we don't see many posts of the nature, but we can definitely think about it more and get something pushed out if it's a problem that's facing people today.\r\n\r\nAgain, the press is just to figure out how we can do it, and whether these kinds of moderation concerns are worth the investment.\r\n\r\nIn any event, it's worth noting the \"loophole\" of sorts to our current system: if you list your problem statement, it's on-topic. That's not always applicable, and in fact isn't really in many of the examples you listed, but much of the time, it is. Consider if you wanted to ask \"what software is there that will let me keep track of customer relations?\" If you just swapped it around and said \"My business is growing, how can I manage my clients to make them each feel independently supported?\" and listed some details, that would be acceptable and probably come to a similar answer. The same is true for your second-to-last example, of how remote staff can interact; if you said \"I have a growing distributed team, how can I help keep everyone on the same page?\" That would be an awesome question, and it would very well lead to an even more awesome answer that included everything and more as an answer to \"What remote collaboration software can my team use?\"\r\n\r\nThis is another of those inconsistencies that I'd love to see fixed, and again, you and everyone else should know that we are, in fact, actively thinking about this.\r\n\r\nI'd hold off on asking the very literal \"I need software that will let marketing people A/B test my homepage\" for now, though.

Granted, of course, it was put on hold within two hours of being posted, but you see my point. I'm assuming that the asker of this question felt that that was enough. We're small business owners here, so most of us probably know: sometimes people have a difficult time accurately conveying their needs.\r\n\r\nI don't want to see our homepage flooded with questions like this. I'm not saying that's going to happen, but it's a risk.\r\n\r\nBeyond that, there's the simple nature of off-site resources: they're, well, off-site. Because of that:\r\n\r\n* They're not self-contained, and I have to click a link to ensure validity of an answer.\r\n* They'll mostly expire eventually, either in accuracy or direct content (some new software blows the suggestion out of the water, or the suggestion goes out of business).\r\n\r\nOn top of that, they're generally fairly opinion-based, whether they have to be or not.\r\n\r\nIn short, software and tools requests require a different type of moderation (by users and us diamonded folks) than other posts. That's okay, but it's an investment we have to be ready to take on as a collective site, and it's something we want to make sure we're *into* before we jump too fast.\r\n\r\nBeyond that, too, I want to make sure we don't dilute posts that *don't* need off-site resources. For example, imagine I asked the question \"https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/1713/how-can-i-retain-customers-for-my-seasonal-business\" and got the answer \"I know of an awesome ad platform that will target customers for repeat business, here's the link.\" Right now, that would be a not-so-hot answer to a question that could (and did) get a good, full, self-contained one. But by opening ourselves up to full-on \"what software does *[this]*?\" questions, that becomes a less unacceptable answer.\r\n\r\nClearly that's something of a convoluted concern, because one bad answer doesn't mean any fewer good ones in theory, but in practice I worry that it could.\r\n\r\n#Me being supportive\r\n\r\nAll that said, we aim to help startups and small business owners, and startups and small business owners often need software.\r\n\r\nThat wasn't such a mouthful. But I think it's really important. We sure don't want to shut out questions that would be helpful, since if we start doing that, we're kind of circumventing our central goal here.\r\n\r\n#The current state of things\r\n\r\nFeeling like I haven't even kind of answered the question here? Me too.\r\n\r\nWell, here goes.\r\n\r\nI'll let you, and anyone else who reads this, in on a little secret: that vote to close reason I mentioned a while ago? We haven't really been using it much. We've fallen into non-enforcement with this, and I can't say I totally dig it. We, your moderator team, has been more or less leaving these sorts of questions up to the community to do with as you will. That's cool and all, but it's not consistent, which is an important part of community development.\r\n\r\nI can only really speak for myself on this, but when I see an awesomely researched and put together question, I don't want to close it, and I won't. If it's only boarder-line-relevant to startups, I'll push it over to our friends at [Software Recommendations](http://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com) (a site that's actually devoted to these types of requests), but if I think it's going to be useful to visitors in the future and it's put together well, I'll leave it.\r\n\r\nBut that's all super unofficial. Technically, again, anyone would be right to close that question.\r\n\r\nSo I guess I have two answers for you:\r\n\r\n 1. No, those questions would be off-topic...\r\n 2. ...unless you phrase it right.\r\n\r\nWe'll be looking into options over the next little while to better-phrase that vote-to-close reason to better reflect the real goal (we want those questions, just only if they're really about startups and well put together and answerable in an objective way).\r\n\r\nIf you have suggestions about how we can convey that in an effective way, or if you'd like to take part in the discussion over the validity of these questions and whether they should be welcome here, I'll urge you over to [that previously listed post](https://startups.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/102/vote-to-close-recommendation-posts?lq=1). Feel free to post an answer and say \"Hey, Matthew, man, this is awful. We need those kinds of posts and they're useful and I love them and I love asking and answering them and I need them in my life!\" or \"I hate them, I hate them, I hate them! I never want to see one of these questions again!\" We haven't viewed this as a super, super high priority because we don't see many posts of the nature, but we can definitely think about it more and get something pushed out if it's a problem that's facing people today.\r\n\r\nAgain, the press is just to figure out how we can do it, and whether these kinds of moderation concerns are worth the investment.\r\n\r\nIn any event, it's worth noting the \"loophole\" of sorts to our current system: if you list your problem statement, it's on-topic. That's not always applicable, and in fact isn't really in many of the examples you listed, but much of the time, it is. Consider if you wanted to ask \"what software is there that will let me keep track of customer relations?\" If you just swapped it around and said \"My business is growing, how can I manage my clients to make them each feel independently supported?\" and listed some details, that would be acceptable and probably come to a similar answer. The same is true for your second-to-last example, of how remote staff can interact; if you said \"I have a growing distributed team, how can I help keep everyone on the same page?\" That would be an awesome question, and it would very well lead to an even more awesome answer that included everything and more as an answer to \"What remote collaboration software can my team use?\"\r\n\r\nThis is another of those inconsistencies that I'd love to see fixed, and again, you and everyone else should know that we are, in fact, actively thinking about this.\r\n\r\nI'd hold off on asking the very literal \"I need software that will let marketing people A/B test my homepage\" for now, though. I think that's a bit too far for our unofficial system to be pushed. Most of this was with reference to questions where the answer would likely include some reference to software."}

As a new, but somewhat immersed, entrant to the startup scene; a lot of my struggles used to be around my life situation and whether a start up is the right thing for me to do. \r\n\r\nA lot of questions on here are in the same vein. People wondering if they should quit their jobs/education to work on a startup. Because of this a lot of questions tend to be about life situations and general guidance as opposed to specific questions. These people get shown the door because their questions are generally to vague. \r\n\r\nI think startups.stackexhchange should entertain these questions, though I don't have a specific way of doing that yet. It seems counter productive to turn away people whose questions have to do with the pre-startup stage."}

{"Id": 550, "PostHistoryTypeId": 2, "PostId": 224, "RevisionGUID": "04256e64-afa9-4e6b-a34f-5c5617b06889", "CreationDate": "2015-02-25T03:07:28.710", "UserId": 59, "Text": "This is a difficult question, which is why I asked you to post it on meta.\r\n\r\nI just went digging for meta posts, but to no avail. I'll keep looking, but essentially, here's what I know.\r\n\r\n**On one hand, we have what Stack Exchange wants.**\r\n\r\nIn my experience, Stack Exchange tends to follow two philosophies when it comes to legality and ethics of questions.\r\n\r\n* First and foremost is the terms of service.\r\n\r\n    This doesn't strictly relate to the question at hand, but the same principle (the spirit of the law, as they say) can be applied here.\r\n\r\n > Use of the Network or Services to violate the security of any computer network, crack passwords or security encryption codes, transfer or store illegal material including that are deemed threatening or obscene, or engage in any kind of illegal activity is expressly prohibited.\r\n\r\n    Essentially, Stack Exchange doesn't want to be liable, with good reason, for displaying the next big security breach publicly. Similarly, I suspect, the company doesn't want to host the steps to tax fraud.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Beyond that, there's a principle that I've read that, in general, some things can be used for bad, but just because something can be used for bad doesn't make it intrinsically bad.\r\n\r\n    I could pop on here, ask a question about how to find a capable developer, then hire a developer to write some very, very evil software for me. Just because that question *could* be used to hurt people, doesn't mean it has to be.\r\n\r\n    Speaking to Stack Overflow, where many of our standards originated, the same kind of thing could be said of network packet sniffers, or key loggers. Yeah, they're sometimes used for bad. But maybe you want to know how to write one so that your software can be protected against it. Pretty much anything can be used for bad, but not everything has to be.\r\n\r\n    On top of that, there's some interpretation of *when rules matter*. Stack Exchange is hosted in the United States, so we're bound by some relatively liberal United States laws, but we do host some religiously themed sites, where participants could be put in grave danger by other governments just for participating. I've heard of users taking those risks on the network, just in the interest of teaching and learning about those religions.\r\n\r\n    Committing tax fraud is (to me, at least, not to everyone, granted) far from the same thing as holding different religious beliefs than those in power. So feel free to ignore that last paragraph if you see so fit.\r\n\r\nSo in general, on that front, my interpretation of the rules is something like:\r\n\r\n> If it's intrinsically malicious, universally unlawful, or down-right evil, it's our job to get that off the site. Otherwise, assuming it's a well-stated, answerable question, it's fine.\r\n\r\nGiven that standard, I'd say that this question should stay. There's nothing unlawful about having an off-shore account, even if it could then be used unlawfully. Maybe that user is planning to move off-shore, it's not really our place to assume.\r\n\r\n**On the other hand, we have what *we*, the community, wants.**\r\n\r\nThis one's tougher, and I hope other users will express their opinions.\r\n\r\nStack Exchange sites are built and moderated by the community, so if we collectively decide that we'll have no part in fraudulent activities, that's something that we can choose to enforce.\r\n\r\nPersonally, speaking to the principles that I've seen similar communities hold, it seems to me that the question should stay.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that [a certain Silk Road developer](http://stackoverflow.com/q/15445285/1270504) got arrested after posting a question on Stack Overflow that led to his identity being leaked.

I'll keep looking, but essentially, here's what I know.\r\n\r\n**On one hand, we have what Stack Exchange wants.**\r\n\r\nIn my experience, Stack Exchange tends to follow two philosophies when it comes to legality and ethics of questions.\r\n\r\n* First and foremost is the terms of service.\r\n\r\n    This doesn't strictly relate to the question at hand, but the same principle (the spirit of the law, as they say) can be applied here.\r\n\r\n > Use of the Network or Services to violate the security of any computer network, crack passwords or security encryption codes, transfer or store illegal material including that are deemed threatening or obscene, or engage in any kind of illegal activity is expressly prohibited.\r\n\r\n    Essentially, Stack Exchange doesn't want to be liable, with good reason, for displaying the next big security breach publicly. Similarly, I suspect, the company doesn't want to host the steps to tax fraud.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Beyond that, there's a principle that I've read that, in general, some things can be used for bad, but just because something can be used for bad doesn't make it intrinsically bad.\r\n\r\n    I could pop on here, ask a question about how to find a capable developer, then hire a developer to write some very, very evil software for me. Just because that question *could* be used to hurt people, doesn't mean it has to be.\r\n\r\n    Speaking to Stack Overflow, where many of our standards originated, the same kind of thing could be said of network packet sniffers, or key loggers. Yeah, they're sometimes used for bad. But maybe you want to know how to write one so that your software can be protected against it. Pretty much anything can be used for bad, but not everything has to be.\r\n\r\n    On top of that, there's some interpretation of *when rules matter*. Stack Exchange is hosted in the United States, so we're bound by some relatively liberal United States laws, but we do host some religiously themed sites, where participants could be put in grave danger by other governments just for participating. I've heard of users taking those risks on the network, just in the interest of teaching and learning about those religions.\r\n\r\n    Committing tax fraud is (to me, at least, not to everyone, granted) far from the same thing as holding different religious beliefs than those in power. So feel free to ignore that last paragraph if you see so fit.\r\n\r\nSo in general, on that front, my interpretation of the rules is something like:\r\n\r\n> If it's intrinsically malicious, universally unlawful, or down-right evil, it's our job to get that off the site. Otherwise, assuming it's a well-stated, answerable question, it's fine.\r\n\r\nGiven that standard, I'd say that this question should stay. There's nothing unlawful about having an off-shore account, even if it could then be used unlawfully. Maybe that user is planning to move off-shore, it's not really our place to assume.\r\n\r\n**On the other hand, we have what *we*, the community, wants.**\r\n\r\nThis one's tougher, and I hope other users will express their opinions.\r\n\r\nStack Exchange sites are built and moderated by the community, so if we collectively decide that we'll have no part in fraudulent activities, that's something that we can choose to enforce.\r\n\r\nPersonally, speaking to the principles that I've seen similar communities hold, it seems to me that the question should stay.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that [a certain Silk Road developer](https://stackoverflow.com/q/15445285/1270504) got arrested after posting a question on Stack Overflow that led to his identity being leaked. Clearly that's different, and in fact the question wasn't asking for something illegal itself, but it's na\u00efve of any user to ask a question thinking that nobody is watching. I wouldn't personally want to ask a question that was clearly related to illegal activities, but that's just me, but I don't think it's the site's job to stop me from making such bad decisions."}

Tag Wikis are meant as a central resource for members of our community. It's awesome that you wanted to contribute to them, but contributions should really be in our own words, and specifically, they should specifically speak to the community itself.\r\n\r\nKnow thy audience. For us, that means tag wikis should, at least, show key relations between the topic at hand and entrepreneurship. Wikipedia is a general resource, and a really good one at that, but it's written for the world, so its phrasing is not as tailored to the community as tag wikis need to be, in order to serve their purpose.\r\n\r\nI think [Gilles' answer](http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/107378/263510) to the MSE post you cited is really well articulated. There's a specific example in that post, but the last paragraph carries a lot of general weight:\r\n\r\n> Tag wikis are mainly intended for people who are about to ask a question; they should help those people write better questions, or find answers on their own.

As Connor said in his [comment](http://meta.startups.stackexchange.com/questions/225/is-it-desirable-that-we-fill-empty-wiki-tag-descriptions-with-wikipedia-content#comment1607_225), if someone wants to know all of that information, Wikipedia will be their first hit anyway.\r\n\r\nGiven all that, I'd encourage double-checking the \"What Are Tag Wikis?\" sidebar.\r\n\r\n> The full tag wiki is a detailed introduction to the topic, suitable as a destination for those curious about it: \r\n\r\n>* what questions should have this tag?\r\n* some basic definitions\r\n* brief introduction to the subject\r\n* important links for learning more\r\n* one reasonably sized page\r\n\r\nI'd encourage anyone who intends to write tag wikis to check over those before submitting. Wikipedia doesn't fulfill many of them. The third point, \"brief introduction to the subject,\" could be argued either way, but the general consensus seems to be that Wikipedia isn't as brief as we need to be on this. The main goals should be to teach users how to use the tag, and where to find more information.\r\n\r\n**Think of it this way: the tag wiki teaches about a *tag*, not a topic.** To understand a tag, one must differentiate the topic, but beyond that, the purpose is to show how the topic relates and is useful to questions on the site.\r\n\r\nThe [blog post linked to by many of these](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/03/redesigned-tags-page/) is also very useful in knowing what content deserves an esteemed position in a tag wiki or tag wiki excerpt.\r\n\r\nAs for your \"main\" question, of whether an empty tag wiki is preferable to a copied one, I would say yes, given everything I've reviewed.

It's not actionable, non-operational, and indeed prone for spam.\r\n\r\nThis one is different: you have an actual entrepreneur who has a remote team to manage, and they need an operational response.

Reviewing an idea or product only helps one person at a specific time. Instead, try asking about a specific business approach and cite yours as an example. \r\n\r\nYou *could* ask a question about what general information you should include in your email, if you're still at that stage. You'll have to watch for subjectivity and broadness, but as long as you phrase it well, that shouldn't be too much of an issue.\r\n\r\nIf you *are* past that stage, and it sounds like you are, **my best direction for you would be to [head over to chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/16081/startups)**.

If you want to continue being able to ask questions here, read that page, and continue to review it. A few users had linked to it after your first and second closed questions, but the third one still wasn't a great fit.\r\n\r\nIf you don't have any more questions to ask (in which case this is all irrelevant, I suppose), you could also try improving your zero-scored question. If you can get that up to a positive score, you may stand a better chance of avoiding the question ban."}

A Startup is essentially a marketing term with no strict definition. A number of people including myself have raised this issue on the meta here and it has so far gone unanswered.\r\n\r\nPart of the issue is its the wrong question. Instead of saying, \"What is a startup\" it should be asked, \"Why are we calling ourselves startup?\"\r\n\r\nAnd the reality is there's no reason. A small growth oriented business isn't a startup. It's just a business. A new startup, its just another way of saying a new business. On the connotative (and as some users on here have also mentioned) there is a notion that startups are tech companies. \r\n\r\nIf I start a new clothing line is it a startup??\r\n\r\n- I want to grow fast\r\n- I'd be happy to sell to a larger manufacturer\r\n- I likely funded it myself or with another investor for the moment\r\n\r\nHow is that different than every company? The answer is its not.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nOnce and really only once that gets resolved comes the issue of scope. What we're going to be left with is \"Business\" which is way too broad. This site needs to determine what is on-topic and what is off-topic.\r\n\r\nI highly suggest this focused is on \"Business Sales and Marketing\"\r\n\r\nThen Off-Topic might include any generic questions about the following:\r\n\r\n - Human Resources (migrate to [Workplace.SE](http://workplace.stackexchange.com))\r\n - How do I incorporate\r\n - Leasing a space / security system / capital expenditures\r\n - [tag:web-development] / [tag:android-development] - get rid of both and close the questions. Migrate the good ones to the appropriate SE.\r\n\r\nThe best SE sites are ones where the Profession dictates the on-topic and off-topic issues. Startups or Business as the entire concept doesn't do that. \r\n\r\nThat's not to say there can't be some overlap say Legal. Most legal questions should be closed and migrated to [Law.SE](http://law.stackexchange.com) but if someone asks a question, \"When arranging a sales meeting at a venue that serves alcohol, are there any laws I or my company need to be aware of?\" - questionable but I could see it staying here.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nRight now because of the name, lack of scope, and tags the site is a bit of a mess. I'm happy to become a pro-tempore mod if the current ones would like the help in doing these things."}

Case studies tend to be broad. \"What are the Dos and Don'ts on [topic]?\" types of questions even more so. However interesting, both are likely too broad to be on topic on this SE (or any other) to begin with.\r\n\r\n2. Most of the questions in the second part of your question could have been valid questions in their own right, without any need for a case study.\r\n\r\n3. The reason I stuck to answering the question in your title was that answering the second part of your question, particularly using the case study as reference data, would likely have turned the answer into a 10k word ebook.\r\n\r\n4. Digging into a company's past will, intuitively, result in mostly praising what it did right if it was successful, and taking a cold hard look at what it likely did wrong if it was not.\r\n\r\n5. Only former staff in a company will know the actual story - successful or not - and the odds are unlikely that any of them are in this SE. When not, the answers will necessarily be speculative and opinion-based.\r\n\r\nPut another way your question was both too broad and primarily opinion-based. (From what I've observed we don't always close such questions on this site when we find them interesting, even though SE's general guidelines suggest that we should.)"}

People may choose not to comment for a variety of reasons such as not wanting to spend the time, avoiding a revenge down vote, or assuming the question is not salvageable. This only fixes the first reason.\r\n\r\nI think a more general approach might be ideas that tackle the underlying issue of poor quality questions. We need to be able to improve questions that can be improved while quickly removing those questions that simply don't belong. I like the suggestion Denis made of having a \"Why did I get a down vote page?\" (https://startups.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/332/how-can-we-try-to-enforce-stricter-standards-for-questions-and-generate-more-goo) Perhaps we can approach it from the other side as well and keep a list of high-quality questions for reference.\r\n\r\nAlso, there are some times where a down vote reason is obvious to experienced users but may not be to the poster. In that case it may be helpful to add a comment even if you are not the down voter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}
