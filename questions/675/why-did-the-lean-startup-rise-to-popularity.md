<p>Many of the core concepts for which Eric Ries' The Lean Startup are based on ideas that have been around for awhile lean manufacturing, theory of constraints, agile, etc.; this is not a secret, for example, at one point, Eric linked to the bio of John Boyd, the creator of the  on OODA loop. Why did the lean startup rise to popularity? For example, has Eric Ries ever publicly commented on any tactics he believes were key to it becoming so popular?</p>

<p>Eric put those existing concepts together in a useful way that others could follow.</p>

<p>Since he bundled up the 'lean startup' concept into a book. All he needed to do was market that book. </p>

<p>The tactics he used weren't much different to marketing a product with some added ingenuity. </p>
