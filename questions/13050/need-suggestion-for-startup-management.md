I've joined hands with 2 other people for startups . My job responsibilities are 

 - Project Management
 - Recruitment
 - Mobile app development
 - Manager(Managing other employees)
 - strategies for the company's growth

Other 2 people's role 
 

 - Investing for companies needs, payment for employees
 - Sales and marketing for getting new projects
 - Helping me if anything required for working. 
 
Right now i'm only getting paid for the project work not for other responsibilities what I do. 

They said they will give me share from the company . I don't know how much to ask, as I feel major operations for running the company I take care and leading and they are investing and getting project contacts. 

Please consider and help with good numbers.

Have a look and put in your numbers, maybe it can help you get an idea.</p>
