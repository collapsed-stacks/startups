<p>I've joined hands with 2 other people for startups . My job responsibilities are </p>

<ul>
<li>Project Management</li>
<li>Recruitment</li>
<li>Mobile app development</li>
<li>Manager(Managing other employees)</li>
<li>strategies for the company's growth</li>
</ul>

<p>Other 2 people's role </p>

<ul>
<li>Investing for companies needs, payment for employees</li>
<li>Sales and marketing for getting new projects</li>
<li>Helping me if anything required for working. </li>
</ul>

<p>Right now i'm only getting paid for the project work not for other responsibilities what I do. </p>

<p>They said they will give me share from the company . I don't know how much to ask, as I feel major operations for running the company I take care and leading and they are investing and getting project contacts. </p>

<p>Please consider and help with good numbers.   </p>

<p>There are a few equity calculators online, like <a href="http://foundrs.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Foundrs</a> and <a href="http://foundersolutions.com/founder_equity_solution" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Founder Solution</a>, as an example. Have a look and put in your numbers, maybe it can help you get an idea.</p>
