Backing cards also called product display cards are the "packaging" that products come zip - tied to. 

Here is an example of a product on a backing card:<br /> http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/81f-d0%2BFMgL._SL1500_.jpg

Any local printers will be able to create these for you.
You just need a design for the front and back then they can get to printing on card.

To attach your product you have a few options.
Tie-wraps
Shrink wrap
vacuum seal
Tape
