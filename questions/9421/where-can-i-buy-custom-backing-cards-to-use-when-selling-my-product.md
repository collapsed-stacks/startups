<p>Backing cards also called product display cards are the "packaging" that products come zip - tied to. </p>

<p>Any local printers will be able to create these for you.
You just need a design for the front and back then they can get to printing on card.</p>

<p>To attach your product you have a few options.
Tie-wraps
Shrink wrap
vacuum seal
Tape</p>
