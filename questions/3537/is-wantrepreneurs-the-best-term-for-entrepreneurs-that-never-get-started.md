Often run into "entrepreneurs" that claim they want to create a startup, but often seemly avoid steps to validate that they in fact have an opportunity that they are in in position to exploit.

Randomly just ran across the term "Wantrepreneurs" - which appears to mean "someone who thinks about being an entrepreneur or starting a business but never gets started."

Is "wantrepreneurs" the best term for this type of entrepreneurs, and more importantly, what separates "real" entrepreneurs from wantrepreneurs?

Wantrepreneurs in my experience are people who attend all the startup meetup, networking, accelerator, hackathon events. They know a lot of the entrepreneurs in a location, they pitch to other entrepreneurs about their startup idea because it is easier to get approval from other entrepreneurs instead of customers. They usually complain about not being able to find cofounders or why investors arenâ€™t putting money in their projects.  

All these plus they still work at a full time job and do not have an idea how they will survive without a car and expensive Apple devices. 

Wantrepreneurs think the field they currently excel at is the only important thing to create a successful company.   
 
- "Coding is meaningless, I'll just outsource it. Doing sales is 90% of what entrepreneurship is about" says a wantrepreneur business guy

- "Sales is meaningless, I'll just hire an intern to do that stuff. Coding is 90% of what entrepreneurship is about" says a wantrepreneur hacker

- "Customer development is meaningless, INSERT HENRY FORD FAST HORSE QUOTE HERE. The entrepreneur knows exactly what to build" says a classic wantrepreneur

Wantrepreneurs didn't understand the fact that, to be a good entrepreneur you have to be proficient in probably more than 10 fields depending on your industry. 

In short wantrepreneurs do not want to take risks, do not want to commit their time in learning different skills but still want to become multi millionaires.

Wannabe entrepreneur also comes to mind.

An entrepreneur executes. A wannabe entrepreneur procrastinates.

An entrepreneur meets prospects and clients and builds a product based on their findings. A wannabe entrepreneur typically builds a product and worries about finding clients later, or finds prospects but never comes back with a product.

**Entreprenever** - "Entrepreneurs" that never get started; they state that they want to create a startup, but often seemly avoid steps to validate that they in fact have an opportunity that they are in in position to exploit. 

Unlikely "wannabes," who are unable to take action even if they wanted -- Entreprenevers are in the position to take meaningful actions, but instead knowingly opt for actions that are meaningless.
