<p>I am a game developer and have been developing backend software for multiplayer games with a company. I now want to release a full fledged gaming backend as a service so that people can integrate their games with my product to make their games multiplayer. Something like <a href="https://fresvii.com/" rel="nofollow">Fresvii</a> and <a href="https://gamesnet.yahoo.com/documentation/services/multiplayer/" rel="nofollow">Yahoo Games</a>.</p>

<p>But I want to understand if there is market for this? Will individual developers or companies pay me to use this or do they believe in developing their own infrastructure?</p>

<p>I would say your product would work in the individual developer market. I doubt game companies themselves will buy it since that trend is to go in-house for most of their operations. But for the individual game developers looking to easily make the game multiplayer, leaderboard, and social connectivity you may be on something. </p>

<p>A quick way to test this would be to contact a mix batch of your prospective markets and simply ask:</p>

<ul>
<li>How much time, resources, e.g. it takes for them to implement the functions you plan to provide.</li>
<li>Do they outsource those functions to 3rd party apps</li>
<li>Type of budget they work with</li>
</ul>

<p>If you get good answers, then build the MVP. </p>

<p>I am a developer as well. And I can tell you go for it if:</p>

<ol>
<li>You have quality software</li>
<li>Have time to maintain it</li>
<li>Have time to support users</li>
<li>Have time to code upgrades</li>
</ol>

<p>You will hear dozens of pro and dozens of cons ideas. But you will never know before you try. I have seen too many silly projects ended up as 1M+ industry, so saying no would be silly. </p>

<p>So once you finished the software, put it alive and invest in marketing. You do not need large companies so make living out of it. </p>
