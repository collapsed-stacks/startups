I am a game developer and have been developing backend software for multiplayer games with a company. I now want to release a full fledged gaming backend as a service so that people can integrate their games with my product to make their games multiplayer. Something like [Fresvii][1] and [Yahoo Games][2].

But I want to understand if there is market for this? Will individual developers or companies pay me to use this or do they believe in developing their own infrastructure?

I would say your product would work in the individual developer market. I doubt game companies themselves will buy it since that trend is to go in-house for most of their operations. But for the individual game developers looking to easily make the game multiplayer, leaderboard, and social connectivity you may be on something. 

A quick way to test this would be to contact a mix batch of your prospective markets and simply ask:

 - How much time, resources, e.g. it takes for them to implement the functions you plan to provide.
 - Do they outsource those functions to 3rd party apps
 - Type of budget they work with

If you get good answers, then build the MVP.

I am a developer as well. And I can tell you go for it if:

1. You have quality software
2. Have time to maintain it
3. Have time to support users
4. Have time to code upgrades

You will hear dozens of pro and dozens of cons ideas. But you will never know before you try. I have seen too many silly projects ended up as 1M+ industry, so saying no would be silly. 

So once you finished the software, put it alive and invest in marketing. You do not need large companies so make living out of it.
