## Broadcasting live with interactive shows without the host having to use video/audio?

Here's my idea which is fairly simple, it is to create a broadcasting network with live 'shows' and channels like on TV, YouTube and radio. However, here's the difference, the host is not talking live on air like on radio, nor are they talking to a camera, they are communicating simply by typing, exactly like a chat room which allows people to come and go as they please. During my show I'll be able to share and broadcast video and audio as part of a live show. The audience are not able to disrupt the show however they are invited to continue messaging the host and even share links to whatever website or video clip they like, as these would be selected by the host to share with all of the audience whenever they like. The host can 'switch on' interactive features during the show which would give one or more guests in the 'audience' the ability to participate in the show in many different ways ranging from live 'radio show' type audio broadcasts to even interactively presenting things as if they were on stage in a theatre! 

The difference between this and social networking websites is you can tune in without registering a profile or without having to establish your own profile just to tune in to my channel. You don't participate in the discussion until the host chooses to allow this feature to grant access to any live discussions which may even allow anyone to post anything on the public live feed / wall. Facebook has pretty much all of the tools to do this but it completely ringfences the 'audience' by restricting access to registered members only and then requires being a 'member' of a group or page which again is exactly the reason why I am asking this question to see if there is an obvious existing solution that would give me a reason not to reinvent the wheel; could you please advise how I would find such a website or app that would give me an easy way of broadcasting my own channel in these ways? If not, I'll get on with the 'show' and continue developing this new platform as a tool to do all of the above in exactly the right way it is intended to be delivered. Many thanks.

So with your question, there are a few things you need to think about with this. You're idea is great, but you need to think about some things before you actually sit down for 1000 hours and program this thing. 

**Reinventing the wheel:** Everybody has a different idea that puts a spin on something else and most ideas derive from products that already exist but just make it better and more beneficial in some way (in most cases). You don't want to sit down for days or spend 100k to have somebody develop something like that for every device and have it be the exact same thing as Google games, Twitch, or any other broadcasting network. What makes this product different besides the kind of broadcasting styles? That isn't good enough to make it a hit and to be honest (maybe harsh, but im trying to be helpful) I don't know anybody who wants to see somebody type in real time. Visuals are everything now days, you want to see what they are doing any how they are doing it which is why broadcasting gaming live or anything else is such a big hit.


**Differences**: Every website different from another, unless the code is stolen of course. You need to create multiple different ways you can create this and it be completely separated from something like Twitch. Think outside the box, just because something has been done doesn't mean you can turn it on its back, add a few things and make it great. Take Facebook for example, it was pretty much like Myspace without music, and it was excuse to a certain set of people which got the public eye after a while. But one or two things different aren't going to make your product any different from its competition. 

**Relativity**: Broadcasting is huge at the moment, especially for things like professional gaming. There is much that can be done with it. People always want to see the next big thing happening right then and there. You need to think about how your product is relative to somebody life or how they could make it apart of it. Thats where the WOW factor comes into play, wow the person to make them come back. From the sounds of it, you want to have anon users which is great...but what can registered users do that anon ones cant? Why would I waste my time registering an account when I don't have more rights than an anon user. Thats what you need to think about when creating this product, as well as design. 

When I am creating a product I develop the idea for weeks maybe even months until I think that it would be beneficial for me to lock myself in my office for days until I get it programmed to my expectations. Throw out some problems you could face, throw out some things you could do if you got some traffic, more employees, etc. Develop the idea, you have a great start but there is still much more you need to do before it can set itself apart from the exact idea than Twitch or Google games. I love the idea, I would be apart of a community like that, but only if it was a little more developed and offered some more differentiation. Hope that wasn't to harsh, you got a great idea going, keep it up!
