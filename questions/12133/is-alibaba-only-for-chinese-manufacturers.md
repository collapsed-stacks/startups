Want to expand my manufacturing to export my product. So I'm looking for listing website. The most popular one seems to be Alibaba, but it seems it's only for Chinese manufacturer?

Is it true? Any other alternative? From googling, I only found thomasnet. Submitted to them but it says take 21 days for verification...

While most of the suppliers are from china in Alibaba, it's open for any suppliers. You can register a supplier account at alibaba if you are from a different country too.

Start at the Alibaba Seller Channel to register your account (free accounts available).
