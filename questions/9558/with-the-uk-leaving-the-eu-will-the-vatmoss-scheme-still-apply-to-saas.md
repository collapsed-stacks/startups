As you all know, the UK has voted to leave the EU. I'm just wondering how, if at all, the VATMOSS scheme will be affected as it's an EU law?

Thanks for any info, I am aware that nothing is changing in regards to the UK for a while yet ;)

<p>There are already two VAT-MOSS schemes "Union VAT MOSS" and "Non-Union VAT MOSS"</p>
