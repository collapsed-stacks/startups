<p>Can anyone point me to a free and good resource for templates which provide a contract between a UK LTD company and a contributing artist (for both music and graphics).</p>

<p>I'm keen to lock in a time-limted exclusive world-wide right to distribute and use this artists work in the game, paying royalties rather than paying outright for the content, and providing protection for both parties.</p>

<p>Not exactly want you want, though given you're not posting an example, figure this is a start: </p>

<p><a href="http://www.tribeofnoise.com/econtract/Exploitationcontract_nonexclusive.pdf" rel="nofollow"><strong>Exclusive Exploitation Contract</strong></a></p>

<p><em>(General gist is that anywhere it says "non-exclusive" you change it to be "exclusive" and update or at least flag text that's not what you need. Also, clearly this contract is owned by someone, but again, better to have a point of reference than nothing.)</em></p>
