I have recently got tickets for assisting the mobile World Congress 2015 in Barcelona, in name of my recently found company. I am wondering how to get the maximum of this event by enabling business opportunities, locally or globally.

We provide software development, covering Mobile, Web and Backend, differentiating by low prices (thanks to the allocation of our software factory in South America). We are just starting and have a couple of clients. This event will be full of international recognized companies but also emerging ones.

What would be good approaches the stands of companies and being closer to get new business opportunities?
I have been recommended to approach the stands, understanding the companies business and taking business cards, to further send emails recalling we have met at the event and offering our services (or our disposal to work together when needed). Would this be too invasive?

You'll be fine. If anything, it's not invasive enough. Since the event is next week, it's a bit too late to set up a booth and do anything super-focused or efficient. But by all means, set yourself one or two precise goals if you haven't done so already, and take all of the necessary steps that apply to meet them.

The very best advice I've ever read on the topic of trade shows, as an aside, was by Steve Blank:

- http://steveblank.com/2009/05/21/trade-shows/

- http://steveblank.com/2009/05/22/trade-shows-part-1/

Just follow the links and read them, as they're absolutely jam-packed with good and sensible advice. He instructs readers to ignore the two posts unless they apply to your industry. I respectfully disagree with him, because much of what he goes on about is still extremely valuable if you bother to read between the lines and gain insights on marketing and sales.

Quoting the very first part, to give you a taste:

> ### Setting Clear Trade Show Objectives

> There’s no use going to a show if you don’t know why.  Answers like, “because our competitors are there,” or “because it’s on our calendar,” or even “because I think we should,” don’t cut it.  (Remember your department has a mission.) There’s a plethora of reasons why a company would want to exhibit at a show:
> 
> - write sales orders
> - generate leads for future sales
> - research the competition
> - spot trends
> - generate awareness and visibility within the industry
> - build our mailing list with quality names
> - find better or cheaper suppliers
> - build rapport with current customers
> - get press
> - generate excitement around a new product introduction
> - get additional partners
> - recruit staff
> 
> The problem with this list is that every company can find at least five things they like on it.   For a small company this is like throwing your tradeshow money on the floor.  A company must pick the one or two top goals or nothing useful will happen. The number one reason a small company is going to a tradeshow is to generate awareness.  As the company gets larger and a large professional sales organization kicks in, its second priority is to generate qualified leads. This doesn’t mean that there aren’t tertiary goals, but they are just that – not the top one or two.

> Before you go to a trade show sales and marketing need to agree to measurable goals. Everything you do before, during, and after the show should be evaluated in terms of whether it contributes toward reaching these goals.  While marketing can decide they are going to the show to generate awareness, marketing can’t decide they are going to a show to generate leads – unless the VP of Sales says that they believe those leads will be valuable and sales has a plan to follow up on those leads. 

> If sales doesn’t think the show is worth going to for the leads, and marketing isn’t going to generate awareness, remind me – why are you going to this show?
