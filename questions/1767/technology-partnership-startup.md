<p>We are interested in partnering with a US based technology (enterprise data storage) company. We do have a team with very good technical and selling skills, the country we intend to sell this product does have a solid potential for this product, however, as this will be our first technology partnership company, we are concerned on the following points:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>One of the major player is already in business in our country with a good customer base. We as a partner would be competing with the manufacturer / principal.</p></li>
<li><p>How can we win the trust of our prospective customers, when we haven't sold this type of product ever in this country?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>A few people we have consulted privately have said that it will be a tough ask requiring a lot of capital in the first year to penetrate through the already big-player customers and or create new customers, because we haven't been in the technology business before.</p>

<p>The company we are partnering with have a superb/solid portfolio for their products and our initial research has demonstrated that we do have the potential, but Enterprise (CIO, CTO) normally would like to go with the already trusted Principal / Partner.</p>
