I'm pretty sure that I am smarter than the average bear.   :)
Two or three days ago, I thought of a Brilliant (million-dollar) idea.
Of course, I should have written down some notes about it, but, alas, I didn't.<br />
I've been Trying to recall; it was something about a new Device or a Process...

And I really thought at the time that it was Seriously Doable and Marketable and it would be In-demand, and I haven't yet seen it on the market.

I've sat in the same place where (I think) I was at the time,
with eyes closed for concentration; and eyes open for viewing the surroundings.
Still, I cannot recall.
My job requires that I take notes about what I do during the day.
I've looked back at those notes, to no avail.  <br />
(I do not think that the Brilliant idea was job-related).<br />

Any suggestions as to how to jog the memory?
