<p>This is a follow up of sorts to <a href="https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/1668/should-i-write-a-holiday-theme-for-my-mobile-app">Should I write a &quot;holiday&quot; theme for my mobile app?</a> For many app developers, it's not feasible to create a holiday version of their app. I was wondering if there are other seasonal strategies that smaller companies can use to gain users during the holidays or is it better to wait out this busy season?</p>

<p>On mobile platforms, the best example I'm aware of is to create a special seasonal release.</p>

<p>For instance, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id406513121" rel="nofollow">"Cut the Rope: Holiday Gift"</a>.</p>

<p>As a freebie, it is useful on two fronts: it served as a reminder for existing clients. It was also an opportunity for existing clients to actively share and promote the app to their friends.</p>

<p>In order to increment your user base you can use the "2x1" strategy. This means, imagine your app has a monthly subscription, you can say "Buy one and give one free to a friend". If your service is good enough (and you are lucky enough) this friend will start paying after the free month. </p>
