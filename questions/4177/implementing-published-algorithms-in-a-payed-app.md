If I find an interesting algorithm in a machine learning journal, can I go ahead and apply it to a particular domain and sell the resulting app?

What if I want to use research in somebody's thesis?

In general, what are the rules about what is OK and what isn't? For example, presumably algorithms in a textbook on the subject are OK.

This is a really wide topic, and the short answer is "depends".

Usually, in journals, as well as in thesis publications, there is no reference of any patent / licensing related to the software if original. 
This doesn't necessary mean there isn't any. 

Also, textbooks sometimes do include algorithms patented, or code implementations released under restrictive licenses.
The fact that the content has been allowed for didactical purpose doesn't necessary mean it can be used in profitable software.

The best advice here is to contact the direct author(s).
