To raise more funds, it has been suggested by our financial director that 10% should be released from mine and my business partner's holdings. My co-founder doesn't want to release any more equity (we both have 25%), but without doing so will make things very hard. He asked if I would release 10% on my own. His rationale is that his innovations are the business.  The flip side is that he has brought in <4% of business ; me, 90% through networks contacts etc.,  as well as driving some of the project work. So, the way I see it we're equal. He may give up if we don't raise enough funds.
If I offered to give up more equity, would taking a cut of his future dividends and a small cut of future business I bring in sound reasonable,  with an equity clawback option?
