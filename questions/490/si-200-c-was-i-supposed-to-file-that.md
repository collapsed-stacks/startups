My co-founders and I started a C-Corp about a year ago. We paid for a counsel to handle all the legal incorporation pieces and what i believed to be inclusive of all state stock filings related to the corporation and it's founders. 

I'm reaching out to the community to find out if a legal counsel handling your incorporation should have filed a Statement of Information-Domestic Stock Corporation (SI-200 C or 200 N/C) OR if this was an oversight of our company and something we should have handled?

The fee to file was 25$ and the late fee is 250.00$.

Based on the name of the form, it sounds like you're company is based in California. If so, a Statement of Information-Domestic Stock Corporation should have been filed a short time after incorporating and every two years after. 

Since it's so closely tied to the incorporation process, I think your legal counsel should have handled this. You'd have to look at your agreement with your legal or talk to them to get a definitive answer of what their services provided. If it was an oversight in their process, they should definitely get that fixed soon. If it was unclear which party should file that document, I'd still expect the legal counsel to file and pay the late fee.
