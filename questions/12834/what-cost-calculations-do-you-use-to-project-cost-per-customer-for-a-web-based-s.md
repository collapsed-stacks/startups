I want to make sure my projected cash flows are as accurate as possible. Which cost calculations do I use if I do not have any actual sales yet ? These cost will be for an online service, I will charge a subscription fee, which expenses do I calculate to get accurate projections for my cost to acquire a customer if I have not acquired any customers first ?

For example CAC =MCC/CA. 
What formulas do you use if you have no Customer Acquisitions (CA) yet, only projections ?

My guess: make expected projections, make "best case" projections, and make "worst case" projections. Then, run your calculations based on each of the 3 projections. (You'll get 3 different results, obviously.)
