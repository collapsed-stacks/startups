I am planning to open a eCommerce site. I am looking for any good resource on how to negotiate / contract with the wholesalers so that I can offer free shipping.

is there any specific business model or are there any consulting companies which help in accomplishing this?

<p>You can find consultancies on <a href="https://www.elance.com/" rel="nofollow">elance</a>, which is a good site for this. I've used it many times before, with good results. You can describe your needs, then get a lot of offers from freelancers. The price range is very wide, but so can the quality be, so do a bit of research, before choosing a freelancer. Check their profiles and references, off course only you can use this for anything.</p>

<p>If you want to look in to a good business model tool, I would recommend Alex Oestenwalder's business model canvas. It's really good and very dynamic. You can see his website <a href="http://businessmodelgeneration.com/canvas/bmc" rel="nofollow">here</a> or see this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynQasjpBTCk" rel="nofollow">video</a> on youtube, that explains the fundamentals.</p>

<p>Hope that it's helpful.</p>
