I'm currently developing a software system which helps educational sector. I'm having a really tight budget. I'm in a flux that should I first copyright it or get funding for it? How much time it'll take to get the copyrights and at what cost for an app and a web API?

Expose the idea to investors, especially if you're using a lot of open source modules in your work. Investors know that such software would have a longer life because ultimately it's community supported (Think MEAN stack based apps).

However, if your work is mostly developed by you with a lot of manual labor and sweat (custom API to interact node with ffmpeg for codec conversion or whatever), and if it really shines above the rest, then do consider getting it patented and licensed. That alone shall add some seriousness to your work when you'll pitch it to investors later on. 

Eventually you'll sell it, and you should at the right time.

Hope it helps! Good luck!
