I'm hiring a social media assistant. That person will need to be able to use my accounts on various sites:  Twitter, Facebook, etc. (I am my brand, BrettFromLA.) Since the duties will take just a few hours a week, I predict there might be turnover in the position. How should I approach sharing passwords with the employee(s)?

One thought is that I could create a new password incorporating something unique to that person, like their middle name ("123Marie456"). That would be simple to switch if I hire a new person.

I'd love to have additional "administrator" accounts on various sites but I bet a lot of sites don't allow multiple users for a single account.

What other approaches might work for this?

<p>Not sure if it qualifies for a full-fledged answer, but there are several applications that allow one to delegate access to social media accounts without actually sharing passwords, such as <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2015/introducing-tweetdeck-teams">TweetDesk</a> or <a href="https://hootsuite.com/products/platform/social-media-collaboration">Hootsuite</a>. </p>

<p>For other options you can try searching the internets for "social media management applications".</p>
