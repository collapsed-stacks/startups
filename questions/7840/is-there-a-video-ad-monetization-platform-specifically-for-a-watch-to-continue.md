I am in the planning/development process of a web-based startup which will be monetized through video advertising. The exact scenario is not similar to youtube in that you cannot skip videos. Rather, during checkout you would have the option to watch an advertisement instead of paying the fee for the service ($2).

I've been doing some searching, but haven't found the perfect monetization platform. Is there any platform that is specifically for this type of 'watch to continue' video advertising? 

Possibly where a question is asked to see if the user has been paying attention. Then once the advertisement has ended the checkout process will complete. Thanks.

I don't believe there is a platform for this, although there are numerous plugins (Wordpress or others) that are able to do this. I saw a plugin a few months ago that has this feature. It is not a plugin located in the wordpress depository.

**Update**


 [Videetv](https://wordpress.org/plugins/videetv-video-monetization/) is a wordpress plugin that came out a week ago. The only downside to this plugin is that the videos you choose are limited to the contents of their video library. They claim that every impression is revenue. 

[Flow Player](https://flowplayer.org/asf/) is a video player that has a partnership with google adsense. The player can be embedded to any platform as its code is an iframe. This player looks a bit more promising as the other, but I suppose that the mose helpful features are available under their paid plan.
