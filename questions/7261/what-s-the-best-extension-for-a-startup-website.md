<p>I'm trying to decide if I should choose a local domain for my start-up's website (like .ro, .bg, .hu) or should I go for something global like .io?</p>

<p>It is depends on your business, goal and target. If you are making website for business and want to target local audience first then choose local extension. And for globally you can choose .com which is best.</p>

<p>Extension it very important so choose it carefully. Because in future, for marketing and search engine optimization that extension matters.</p>

<p>It depends on the service or product you'll offer and on the market it is supposed to target.</p>

<p>But since the question is <strong>pretty general you should usually strive for getting the .com domain extension</strong>.</p>

<p>Paul Graham has published an essay on why choosing .com is important: <a href="http://paulgraham.com/name.html" rel="nofollow">Change Your Name</a>.</p>

<p>You can have more than one domain name go to the same site.  Domain name registration is relatively cheap.  Tie up the domains you want.  It is a good practice to tie up .com if you can.  </p>

<p>That depends on your startup motive, I'd personally prefer .com because of search engine optimization (seo) It's better not to compromise over the this issue otherwise you might regret it later. </p>
