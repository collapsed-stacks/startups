<h1>BACKGROUND \ DEFINITIONS</h1>

<p>When choosing a business structure, LLC, S-Corp, etc: it can viewed as a process.  Assuming that one is in the USA: the <strong>inputs</strong> of the process include choosing:</p>

<ol>
<li>business structure for the purpose of IRS taxation filing</li>
<li>business structure for the purpose of filing at the state level</li>
<li>number of partners in the small business</li>
</ol>

<p>For this discussion, we can refer to a combination of line items 1&amp;2 as a <strong><em>'business-structure pair'</em></strong>.  Example a Florida LLC (1) that files as an IRS S-Corp (2) enjoys <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/101315/taxes-florida-small-businesses-basics.asp" rel="nofollow noreferrer">state-income tax (5.5%) exemption.</a></p>

<p>Outputs of the process include advantages and disadvantages when compared to other choices:</p>

<ol start="4">
<li>Double Taxation (disadvantage)</li>
<li>Exemptions from annual reports, directors + shareholder meetings (advantage)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/101315/taxes-florida-small-businesses-basics.asp" rel="nofollow noreferrer">State income tax exemption (advantage)</a></li>
<li>Federal income tax advantages / disadvantages</li>
<li>Other TBD considerations</li>
</ol>

<p>Ideally there a grid (table) that enumerates the combinations of 'business-structure pairs' on the vertical axis and the outputs of key outcomes / consideration on the horizontal axis (line items 4,5,6...)</p>

<h1>QUESTION</h1>

<ul>
<li>Does such a unicorn (grid) exist?</li>
<li>If not, what other key considerations should one consider (line items
8+)</li>
<li>Are there any additional inputs to the process?</li>
</ul>

<p>If there are other critical inputs to the process, please feel free to edit the question or post a comment, as identifying inputs (and outputs) are central to this Q&amp;A.  One could make the case that <strong>specific context</strong> (below) are inputs to the process.</p>

<h1>SPECIFIC CONTEXT</h1>

<p>A Florida company with no employees (all work to be done through contractors) with one owner and no investors.</p>
