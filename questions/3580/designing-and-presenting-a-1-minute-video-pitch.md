I need to create a 1-minute video pitch for an entrepreneurship contest that I'm entering.  The problem is, I've never done anything like this before. 

 I know what I want to say in terms of the "big three": the problem I'm solving, how I'm solving it, and how I plan to monetize my solution.  I even have a working demo (it's a web platform), so the product itself is somewhat "proven".

One possibility is that I just put on a suit and give a 30-second pitch followed by 30 seconds of demo. <br />
 But the medium of video is so much richer than anything I'm used to designing.  

Should I film in a studio, or some place more lively?<br /> 
How can I come up with a soundtrack that isn't cheesy?<br />Should I try to get footage with potential customers? 

I have no experience with filmmaking, and would be borrowing a camera from a friend.

In short, **how can I best take advantage of film medium to convey my pitch?**

**Get It Done:** Producing video content takes time, and for some, lots of time. Create a video production schedule, and stick to it.

**Get Help:** If you need tips, checkout the [Stack Exchange for Video Production](https://video.stackexchange.com/).

**Know Your Audience:** Core part of this is knowing any rules that are required. Next, if it's possible, if they've posted advice on what to do, give some serious thought to it.

**Just Be You:** It's hard to believe, but nothing is worst than being a fake - just be you. One key exception to this is you don't smile, give it a try, and just make sure you know how to "[fake smile](http://www.wikihow.com/Smize)".

**Get to the Point:** If you're hoping someone is going to watch your video all the way through, don't waste the first 20-30 seconds with some special effect intro -- give them the core points and a reason to keep watching too.

**Make the Ask, then Make It Again:** Always surprises me that some people forget to directly ask for what they want. Ask for what you want, and make sure you repeat it too.

**Copyright Infringement:** Pretty simple, don't do it.

<p>You might find a few creative ideas and figure out "do"s and "don't"s by watching, for example, student competition videos, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=the%20new%20school%20competition%202015" rel="nofollow">such as these</a>. Try watching them as a "judge", you'll probably notice what might work.</p>

<p>As a bonus, you could probably enlist one of the video authors to help you at a reasonable expense.</p>
