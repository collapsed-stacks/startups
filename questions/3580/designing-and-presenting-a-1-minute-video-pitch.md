<p>I need to create a 1-minute video pitch for an entrepreneurship contest that I'm entering.  The problem is, I've never done anything like this before. </p>

<p>I know what I want to say in terms of the "big three": the problem I'm solving, how I'm solving it, and how I plan to monetize my solution.  I even have a working demo (it's a web platform), so the product itself is somewhat "proven".</p>

<p>One possibility is that I just put on a suit and give a 30-second pitch followed by 30 seconds of demo. <br />
 But the medium of video is so much richer than anything I'm used to designing.  </p>

<p>Should I film in a studio, or some place more lively?<br /> 
How can I come up with a soundtrack that isn't cheesy?<br />Should I try to get footage with potential customers? </p>

<p>I have no experience with filmmaking, and would be borrowing a camera from a friend.</p>

<p>In short, <strong>how can I best take advantage of film medium to convey my pitch?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Get It Done:</strong> Producing video content takes time, and for some, lots of time. Create a video production schedule, and stick to it.</p>

<p><strong>Get Help:</strong> If you need tips, checkout the <a href="https://video.stackexchange.com/">Stack Exchange for Video Production</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Know Your Audience:</strong> Core part of this is knowing any rules that are required. Next, if it's possible, if they've posted advice on what to do, give some serious thought to it.</p>

<p><strong>Just Be You:</strong> It's hard to believe, but nothing is worst than being a fake - just be you. One key exception to this is you don't smile, give it a try, and just make sure you know how to "<a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Smize" rel="nofollow noreferrer">fake smile</a>".</p>

<p><strong>Get to the Point:</strong> If you're hoping someone is going to watch your video all the way through, don't waste the first 20-30 seconds with some special effect intro -- give them the core points and a reason to keep watching too.</p>

<p><strong>Make the Ask, then Make It Again:</strong> Always surprises me that some people forget to directly ask for what they want. Ask for what you want, and make sure you repeat it too.</p>

<p><strong>Copyright Infringement:</strong> Pretty simple, don't do it.</p>

<p>You might find a few creative ideas and figure out "do"s and "don't"s by watching, for example, student competition videos, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=the%20new%20school%20competition%202015" rel="nofollow">such as these</a>. Try watching them as a "judge", you'll probably notice what might work.</p>

<p>As a bonus, you could probably enlist one of the video authors to help you at a reasonable expense.</p>
