I want to register the Services based IT Startup company in India first and then go overseas, preferably US and register it as an LLC (or a better suggestion). 

I want minimum legal fee, minimum taxes, minimum procedure costs etc. Once the company is up and running and has clients, I won't have a problem with the taxes then because they won't come out of my pockets.

Alari Trutts and Essa Kay make some great points. My suggestion is you start in India as a Pvt. Ltd., leverage the 3 year tax-free scheme for Startups and only go about incorporating in the US when you have running revenue streams or a signed client. 

Setting up an LLC is trivial and you have a host of options ranging from through the comfort of your browser on LegalZoom or over the phone with any lawyer. So as Alari stated, yes, it is more expensive to setup a company in the US versus India, however, it is also infinitely easier. Depending on the state of your choice it'll be about 600-900 USD including all fees for an LLC.
