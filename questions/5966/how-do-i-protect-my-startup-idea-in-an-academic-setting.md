<h3>Background</h3>
* I will be attending a course about startups at a local university.

* In that course, I am considering disclosing my idea to the other students.

* I am concerned that disclosing my idea to the class might lead to someone stealing it before I can gain traction in developing my idea.

<h3>Question</h3>
> **Is my concern justified?** What advice would others give me about how to best protect my idea and still effectively participating in the course?

Don't be concerned about it. It is all about the **execution**. No offense, but ideas are easy to generate. 

If anything, you might only find other people who might be interested in the same topic/niche: 

 - If these people are smart - connect and maybe you can work on the
   project together.  
 - If these people are not that smart - they won't be a    competition to you
   because they don't understand/believe/care about    what you have in
   mind. You can not create a serious business/product unless you are **truly passionate** about it.

I think you should discuss your concerns with the instructor. Ask for his advice. He must have had this issue come up before. You can always consider asking everyone to sign and NDA but I'm not sure how that might turn out?

It seems like there are two camps when it comes to NDAs. Those generally in favor. And those generally opposed. So, in your case, that topic might depend highly on the specific individuals involved. So I would ask the lead instructor for advice first.
