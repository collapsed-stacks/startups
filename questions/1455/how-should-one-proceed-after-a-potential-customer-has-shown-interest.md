For a startup that sells a web service, we have done the advertising part, and the customer has expressed interest in the product via email or via telephone.

What should be next, sending the customer a WSLA (web service level agreement) or should I cut to the chase and send to the potential customer a quote and payment details?

It often depends on the customer. 

If they expressed direct interest in a specific product and service and seemed ready to move forward then give them all the terms, a quote and payment details and ask if they have further questions.

If they seemed more interested in clarifying a few things first such as different options or asking specific questions about terms and conditions then be sure to answer their questions and guide them through the process a little more.

Meet your customer where they are at and then help them understand what you can offer. This way they won't be confused and will likely be more satisfied with your services in the long run.
