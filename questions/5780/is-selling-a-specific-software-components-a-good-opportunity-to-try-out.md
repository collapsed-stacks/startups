## Is selling a specific software-components a good opportunity to try out?

I created a framework for founding a social portals of specific kind, which I'm still developing. I created it for my own purposes: founding some portals as described.

But now I'm considering the idea (given me by multiple friends independently, it wasn't mine) of selling the source code, but it actually wasn't my primary idea, and I have no experience with selling software at all.

What I have learned so far, is that investors wouldn't be quite interested in the subject (though I didn't ask any for this, just read a book written by one of investors) - because they rather prefer working business models.

So before I come to any conclusion, I wanted to ask you about some things:

 - is selling specific-purpose (not general-purpose, like say Wordpress, Joomla or Zend) frameworks really something needed, and there could be a market for it?
 - should creating a business model over selling a source code, next to business model over actually using it, considered an extra opportunity, or rather extra trouble?
 - perhaps, is selling process too overwhelming to jump into, instead of focusing on the code itself?
