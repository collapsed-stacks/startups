<p>Sometimes it is hard for business to grab clients just because they are in a different city/country/continent. How a SaaS company can attract other businesses to buy the service at distance? What contact techniques should be used? How to make for distance not being a problem?</p>

<p>The same way other businesses do it: inbound campaigns, outbound campaigns... Which could be declined here ad nauseam, but there's actually little point - Googling <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/inbound-marketing" rel="nofollow noreferrer">inbound sales tips</a> and <a href="http://blog.close.io" rel="nofollow noreferrer">outbound sales tips</a> will yield plenty of good results on top of two sites I linked to.</p>

<p>There's nothing special about SaaS in this respect. It's sales, plain and simple. Unless you're selling cheap SaaS products, arguably, in which case outbound or having a sales team usually isn't worth it - but the same holds for a cheap consumer product too.</p>

<p>Where SaaS usually makes a difference is that your eye usually is on churn and customer lifetime value, since you're typically dealing with recurring revenue. But even there you'll find plenty of examples of non-SaaS businesses that do the exact same thing to sell recurring subscriptions to just about anything.</p>

<p>It actually <em>is</em> a problem, sorry. If you need support e.g. in the late afternoon PST, and are dealing with a European or India team that is done with their day or still asleep, it <em>can</em> be a real problem.</p>

<p>Software as a Service by definition should cover distance. The questions you ask should not be a concern of SaaS.</p>

<p>The biggest example is Microsoft. They switched the sale of Office from in store selling of the software to a complete online suite of tools used by people around the world. </p>

<p>Your biggest challenge is educating the masses that your software exist.</p>

<p>Look at Open Office, it is a direct competitor to MS Office. They give it away for free compared to MS charging $5/mo access to the base product. </p>

<p>I use Open Office and while it is not as good(in my opinion after being a MS office client for years) as MS Office. It still gets a hefty amount of downloads. But because it is a not for profit venture. It can apply for grant money to keep it going.</p>

<p>Wikipedia is another example of software as a service. They rely totally on grants and donations and have survived since inception January 10, 2001.</p>

<p>So you don't miss it, distance is not your problem. People knowing who you are is the hurdle you need to cross.</p>
