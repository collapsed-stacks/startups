<p>Kevin kelly argues that we are moving to a network economy. That is probably true. Now I am connected to the internet more that I ever was, and almost cant do without the internet. But what is the driver behind that increase in connectivity? Is that driven by a innate human desire to connect to other people? Or for more information? Or is it because I can do things faster if I can get help from other people?</p>
