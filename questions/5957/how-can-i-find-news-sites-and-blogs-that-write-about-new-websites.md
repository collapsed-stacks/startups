<p>I'm constantly hearing about all sorts of news sites and blogs that write feature stories about hot new websites, but I can't seem to find any. Does anyone know any such sites, or at least know how to search for them?</p>

<p>If you ever seen a website where at the middle of the page they had a big banner saying: "As seen on: The NY Times, Mashable, CNN, etc, etc.", the chances are that those are all feature articles. Every big news website does feature articles it only depends on the PR skills you have.</p>

<p>One technique you could use is the <strong>AirBnB trick</strong>, where they essentially started writing local news sites asking them to write a feature article about them. Small websites will be happy to do this since they need the content. Have enough small websites feature you and start emailing the bigger ones. </p>

<p>The thing is, that if you can <strong>tell your story in a very compelling way</strong>, then you might even be lucky enough to be contacted by these bigger news sites. Big news sites monitor smaller ones and eachother, and if they pick up on a story that gets featured on multiple sites they might decide to feature you as well. They hope that you'll go viral and bring them a big chunk of traffic.</p>

<p>If you enter in this virtuous circle, in no time you'll end up getting featured on the biggest news sites and tv stations in the world. This is how AirBnB did it and this is the pattern many others try to use.</p>

<p>In the case of AirBnB their "compelling story" was that they started out by renting their own bedrooms. They started writing to local news sites and TV stations, and eventually they got picked up by CNN. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>I'm not sure what you're looking for exactly, but if you just want to get your startup listed search for <code>where to list my startup</code>, you'll find plenty of results. If you want to get featured articles about your startup, you need to search for news sites in your domain and start emailing them manually.</p>

<p>There is also this website: <a href="http://startuplister.com/" rel="nofollow">http://startuplister.com/</a> They will submit your startup to 60+ websites for $75.</p>

<p>As specific websites go here in my opinion the top 8 most important websites where you can submit your startup or get a featured article (the last 3 are for articles):</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.producthunt.com/" rel="nofollow">ProductHunt</a></li>
<li><a href="http://betalist.com/" rel="nofollow">BetaList</a></li>
<li><a href="https://angel.co/companies" rel="nofollow">AngelList</a> </li>
<li><a href="http://startupli.st/" rel="nofollow">startupList</a></li>
<li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/" rel="nofollow">HackerNews</a></li>
<li><a href="http://techcrunch.com/" rel="nofollow">TechCrunch</a></li>
<li><a href="http://mashable.com/" rel="nofollow">Mashable</a></li>
<li><a href="http://venturebeat.com/" rel="nofollow">VentureBeat</a></li>
</ol>

<p>Some other places where you can list your startup: <a href="http://startupbeat.com/" rel="nofollow">StartupBeat</a>, <a href="http://startup88.com/" rel="nofollow">Startup88</a>, <a href="http://www.randomstartup.org/" rel="nofollow">RandomStartup</a>, <a href="http://www.new-startups.com/" rel="nofollow">NewStartups</a>, <a href="http://launchlist.co/" rel="nofollow">LaunchList</a>, <a href="http://killerstartups.com/" rel="nofollow">KillerStartups</a>, <a href="http://www.coolstartupbro.com/" rel="nofollow">CoolStartupBro</a>, <a href="http://startupdope.com/" rel="nofollow">StartupDope</a>.</p>

<h3>Answer</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Be strategic.</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li><p><strong>Niche</strong> your product.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Segment</strong> your targets.</p></li>
  <li><p>Attack with a <strong>plan</strong>.</p></li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<h3>Define your niche</h3>

<p>I think you should take a niche approach and target your pursuit of sites that deal with the specific category in which your website fits.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Segment your available options</h3>

<p>After you determine which niche category your site falls into, then</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Do a google search to figure out which web sites are publishing content of the nature you want published about you.</p></li>
<li><p>Categorize those sites into segments for you to attack/approach. Something simple like maybe: small, medium and large.</p></li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h3>Make a tactical plan of attack</h3>

<p>Do the laddering trick described in the other answer above. Start with the smallest sites. Target them. After you get published there, approach the larger sites and so forth. That is generally a good plan for most things.</p>
