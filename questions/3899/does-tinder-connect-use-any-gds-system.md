<p>GDS means global distribution system. Terminology comes from accomodation booking, where big players booking.com airbnb.com are sharing info about their users. Does Tinder based on a similar business model? Do they use other market competitors databases, user registraitions?</p>

<p>As I understand Tinder, it's geolocated dating using a mobile app. So it's likely they're using their own systems and database.</p>

<p>That said, my understanding of the dating industry is that there are databases running around. So take the answer with a fistfull of salt. (Only a Tinder employee would know.)</p>
