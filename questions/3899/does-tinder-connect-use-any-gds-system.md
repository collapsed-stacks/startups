GDS means global distribution system. Terminology comes from accomodation booking, where big players booking.com airbnb.com are sharing info about their users. Does Tinder based on a similar business model? Do they use other market competitors databases, user registraitions?

As I understand Tinder, it's geolocated dating using a mobile app. So it's likely they're using their own systems and database.

That said, my understanding of the dating industry is that there are databases running around. So take the answer with a fistfull of salt. (Only a Tinder employee would know.)
