<p>PQL: Product Qualified Lead</p>

<p>From <a href="http://tomtunguz.com/the-new-sales-hotness-the-product-qualified-lead-pql/" rel="nofollow">this article</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>PQLs are potential customers who have used a product and reached
  pre-defined triggers that signify a strong likelihood to become a
  paying customer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, are there any commonly used practices for scoring PQL's, or are they completely company and segment dependent?</p>

<p>And how does PQL scoring generally happen at companies where they do it?</p>
