PQL: Product Qualified Lead

From [this article][1]:

> PQLs are potential customers who have used a product and reached
> pre-defined triggers that signify a strong likelihood to become a
> paying customer.

So, are there any commonly used practices for scoring PQL's, or are they completely company and segment dependent?

And how does PQL scoring generally happen at companies where they do it?
