<p>I have been trying, without any luck, to get a sense of the size of the market that I am in.  We make a browser-based reading comprehension program for grades 3-8, and I am not even sure where to begin looking for this information.  Nothing that I have found is even remotely useful.</p>

<p>Ideally, I would want state-by-state numbers in the US, a total US market size, and some international data, but at this point, I will be happy to get anything.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for any help that you can provide me in my search.</p>

<p>A proxy might be:</p>

<ol>
<li>Number of students who graduate out of high school per year in the US.</li>
<li>Percentage of households that have children and e.g. an iPad. (Assuming you're doing an iPad app.)</li>
<li>Multiply 6 years (grades 3-8) times number of students times household equipment rate.</li>
</ol>

<p>This will give you a proxy of your maximum market size. If you really want to go into further/proper details, consider:</p>

<ol start="4">
<li>Of these, how many purchase educational apps? (Big question.)</li>
<li>Of these, how many would need and actually purchase a reading comprehension app? (Even bigger question.)</li>
</ol>

<p>I've no idea off the top of my head where you'd find these figures beyond suggesting you to go to local schools in your area and actually ask parents as they wait for their kids to get a rough feeling of what the figures are.</p>
