<p>This is my scenario:</p>

<ol>
<li>We are 2 people (Me and my friend).</li>
<li>He is foreigner. </li>
<li>He has a registered company in India (No employees). He is Director/Chairman</li>
<li>He has the Idea.</li>
<li>He made the seed investment.</li>
<li>I am Vice-Chairman of the company.</li>
<li>I did all the software development. He has no IT-Knowledge</li>
<li>We together created the business plan. He gave the core Idea and I developed it further.</li>
<li>He gave me some money just enough for my living expenses, Every month as I left my job &amp; was working full time on the project.</li>
<li>As he is not in the country since 6 months, I was managing all the business in India along with development.</li>
<li>He also plans to make my incharge of business in India and will go back to his country. I will managing everything here while he will manage from there and expand.</li>
<li>Initially, When we started the development, He promised me to pay fixed salary plus some percentage.</li>
<li>We didn't decide on the value of percentage that time. </li>
<li>Our project development is about to get complete and he is coming to India soon.</li>
<li>We will be launching by 2nd week of July.</li>
<li>After launch, We will be managing the company together but he has language problem so I will be doing most of the work and talking. </li>
</ol>

<p>My Prespective: He has the company, He had the Idea, He did the investment. I developed the business model and also the product, I made the business strategies. We both will be managing the company.</p>

<p>My question is, "</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What should I ask for compensation as salary and what is the
  percentage I deserve?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"</p>

<p>Note: I didn't take my salary since 2 months as we are running short on funds and our project is not started yet.</p>

<p>Please provide some insight and advice for what will be the right &amp; ethical thing to do.</p>
