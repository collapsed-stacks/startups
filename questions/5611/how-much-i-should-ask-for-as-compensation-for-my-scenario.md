This is my scenario:

01. We are 2 people (Me and my friend).
02. He is foreigner. 
03. He has a registered company in India (No employees). He is Director/Chairman
04. He has the Idea.
05. He made the seed investment.
06. I am Vice-Chairman of the company.
07. I did all the software development. He has no IT-Knowledge
08. We together created the business plan. He gave the core Idea and I developed it further.
09. He gave me some money just enough for my living expenses, Every month as I left my job & was working full time on the project.
10. As he is not in the country since 6 months, I was managing all the business in India along with development.
11. He also plans to make my incharge of business in India and will go back to his country. I will managing everything here while he will manage from there and expand.
12. Initially, When we started the development, He promised me to pay fixed salary plus some percentage.
13. We didn't decide on the value of percentage that time. 
14. Our project development is about to get complete and he is coming to India soon.
15. We will be launching by 2nd week of July.
16. After launch, We will be managing the company together but he has language problem so I will be doing most of the work and talking. 


My Prespective: He has the company, He had the Idea, He did the investment. I developed the business model and also the product, I made the business strategies. We both will be managing the company.

My question is, "

> What should I ask for compensation as salary and what is the
> percentage I deserve?

"

Note: I didn't take my salary since 2 months as we are running short on funds and our project is not started yet.

Please provide some insight and advice for what will be the right & ethical thing to do.
