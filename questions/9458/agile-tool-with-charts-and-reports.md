<p>So, after studying a lot about project management, task allocation, performance analysis, etc. I found agile as the solution, be it scrum or kanban.</p>

<p>The tool I had been suggested to use was <a href="https://trello.com/" rel="nofollow">Trello</a>. It is nice, with lists, cards, etc. But one great problem of Trello is that it does not have charts or reports.</p>

<p>I want to be able to track the performance of staff, see who has done what, who has spent how much time in the previous month, upcoming deadlines, assignments, etc. So basically I need lots of charts, reports, visuals, etc.</p>

<p>Would you please suggest some feature-rich (and preferably free) online tools, as the agile project management tool?</p>

<p><strong>Jira</strong></p>

<p>We use <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">jira (by Atlassian)</a> a lot, and is also a much better tool than Trello, when it comes to software development team or when you want team-level or individual level analytics.</p>

<p>jira has some really good <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/jira/generating-reports-185729499.html">analytics capabilities</a> and also have connectors for dash boarding the same.</p>

<p>[The linked report is just an example. One can create any custom reports through it]</p>

<p>I second Dawny33's Jira recommendation, as it is very comprehensive.</p>

<p>I would also recommend <a href="https://taiga.io/" rel="nofollow">Taiga.io</a> as it has a free option and I found it to be very good to use even in its early stages. It had some good reporting about my projects. It was also very flexible about using either Scrum or Agile as well as mixing the two.</p>

<p>As a plus, they recently released their "task based employment marketplace" at <a href="https://tribe.taiga.io/" rel="nofollow">https://tribe.taiga.io/</a> where you can get software development tasks completed for a cost.</p>

<p>Cheers.</p>
