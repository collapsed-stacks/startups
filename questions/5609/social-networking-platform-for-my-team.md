My startup's looking for an internal social networking tool to use in the office for socialising, and also to group-proof documents.

It *definitely* needs to:

* allow **inline** file commenting for things like PDFs **(We've really struggled to find one with this)**
* be available in my cloud - online service?
* be available on mobile & desktop

What do you guys use? What'd you suggest?

I believe what you are looking for is Slack.com - it is a great website for companies who are looking to chat and share things in certain groups. It has a lot of features that can enable your team to share easily and get things done effectively.

You need two tools, then. One to socialize and chat. Another to group-edit and proof-read documents.

There are plenty of chat tools. Besides the obvious like IRC, Skype, or Hangouts, look into Slack, Hipchat, etc. (And don't miss Zapier and IFTTT.)

For the group-editing of docs, startups I run into all use Google Docs. Two key alternatives include iWork for iCloud and Office 365 with Azure. None of these let you edit and comment PDF files, but they basically covers all other bases.
