<p>I have already started my startup a year ago. But I have not been able to balance startup and family time. Especially, often I have no time to accompany my baby, a lovely daughter, which sometimes causes her to be quite upset.</p>

<p>How do you balance the time between startup and family?</p>

<p>Always keep in mind that you won't get that time back with your family. Stop working at 5 or 6 and spend time with it.</p>

<p>If that means your startup will move slower then so be it. Your startup can wait. Your daughter won't. She'll grow to age 10 and 20 before you know it.</p>
