I work for a UK limited company with two shareholders, and two directors. I am one of the directors and the majority shareholder (over %50 of total shares). The company's articles of association are the Model Articles.

If I want to remove the other shareholder as director, is it sufficient for me to call a general meeting with 28 days advance notice, and pass an ordinary resolution with my shares? Would the Companies Act 2006 allow such an action, especially in regards to conflict of interest law?
