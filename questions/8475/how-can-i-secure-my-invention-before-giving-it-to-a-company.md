## How can I secure my invention before giving it to a company?

I am an undergrad engineering student yet to obtain a degree. I had developed a device which has been done before, but I devised my own method and algorithms to build it.

Now, a very recognized startup based in silicon valley wants me to complete it for them for a huge financial award ($1,000 usd) and a place for me in their startup.

What might be the legal routes I need to consider to avoid any mishaps and secure my invention? I really can't afford the huge patent fees being an undergrad.

There are a few "poor man's" methods for establishing proof of WHEN you created your intellectual property.  Then the startup will have to prove that they had the IP before you brought it to them.

1. Print out the IP and mail it to yourself via registered mail. Take the UNOPENED letter and store it someplace safe.
2. Create an "inventor's notebook", any type of documentation that shows your IP, and have it witnessed (signed and dated) by someone reputable (a lawyer).

You can do both of these by mailing to yourself the witnessed IP.

I can't give you a great answer, yet as it has been stated in the comment, nor pattents nor copyrights protect algorithms.

You have few solutions :

 - obfuscate your code and darken the compiled for by stripping symbols and adding blur, this will only delay the discovery of you're algorithm
 - add a licence header to any source file to protect YOUR particular implementation
 - contact a lawyer and eventually make a pattent for YOUR particular implementation
 - modify the essential parts to be used as a service, this way your algorithm execute in your site (secured even in the sight of the law) and client get their data crunched online in a place they can't extract the algorithm from.

I know it looks stupid, but after years of developping a great game engine, a friend of mine noticed every technology could be stolen at any time. That is maybe why licencing as open source have so much success : whatever happens the best you can do is leave your name to the algorithm and its first implementation.

I am not a lawyer, but as I understand, you automatically own the copyright for anything that you create. So, how do you prove to a judge that you were the original creator?

 - Free: Some people publish blueprints and prototypes on youtube or somewhere else to show the judge that they are the creator.

 - Paid: Your best bet is to get a patent because this will make the legal process easier. If you have a patent, you can even recover attorney fees that you will have to pay when you sue the company for stealing your product.

It is probably best to talk with a copyright lawyer.
