I was having an interesting conversation with one of my friends. His company recently won a contract from the Air Force for a big project. The contract is worth a lot of money, but they can only receive the funds after they deliver the project. That means they will have to probably get a loan to finance it. In the meantime, as soon as they found out they won the contract they got a call from Google offering to finance them. Now, I've the following questions about this matter: 

 1. Why would Google finance them in this sector? 
    
 2. Is Google really interested in the technology? Or just trying to loan money for profit?

It was out of the blue, but it was suspicious because I know they are strategic in their quest for tech and not necessarily looking for more money.

Did anyone run into something like this before?


Update:

3. My other concern is that How Google was able to find out the information regarding the contract; Are they really this active in crawling the pages for information? or Do they have somesort of tie-ups with the defense companies?

<p>Thats an interesting question you ask and sounds like google are quit offensive.
I think that only google can give the correct answers to your questions. But that doesn't mean I can give my opinion.</p>

<p>Q1: Its hard to answer, since you don't specify the sector very much. The reason could be strategic, meaning that the investment is not about the technology, but more about influence or strategic reasons</p>

<p>Q2: If you consider the Air Force to be the same sector as the military, google have invested in that sector before. They invested in advanced robotics developed for military purposes, you can read some of it <a href="http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/12/16/google-investing-heavily-in-advanced-robotics-buys-renowned-military-contractor" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Google does have a money lender strategy, which you can find more information about from this <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/102341801#." rel="nofollow">link</a>.</p>

<p>Q3: It seems like googles crawling is algorithmic for common purposes according to this <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/34439?hl=en" rel="nofollow">information</a>.If your friend received a phonecall within a few hours, they probably been waiting for the information to be official(online). This indicates they are interested in the specific area and not just interested in lending money to your friend. Another question that is raised from this, is how did google know they would need to borrow money?</p>

<p>Hope that my answer is of use. Otherwise try asking the same question <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/+LarryPage/posts" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

These are the core ideas behind every project that Google and other giant like Google think.

Just go back to the 5 years, Facebook give fund to Instagram for server development and which results into benefit of Facebook as most of the audience connected to Facebook just because of Instagram.

Google know about your quality and it can trust on you because you have capabilities to do the project that's why you got this contract. Google wants a relationship with you to just increase its reach or say Google invite you for the upcoming year business with you.
