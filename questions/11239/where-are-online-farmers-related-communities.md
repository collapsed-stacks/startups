I am analyzing the market and possibilities of the farming in Euro Union or the US. Especially, for the crops, different kinds of horticulture, like tomatoes, lettuce and so on. I want to collect information about small farms needs in relates to planting, watering, fertilizing, harvesting, and things around it.

I'd like to find farmers who are in the industry and who I can ask some questions and discuss.

So, are there any forums, community boards, may be like StackExchange ones on the web? I found some blogs, news sites, or sites of organizations, but not much luck with forums.

Please advise if you know some.
