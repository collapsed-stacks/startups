Let's consider the following simple scenario: 

- I just uploaded a game app on iTunes and Google play. 
- We assume the app has the potential to become in the top 100 of both app stores as long as the marketing is performed correctly. So in principle it doesn't depend on the quality of the app or demands of the market.

Which would be the fastest marketing strategies to follow to achieve my goal if my budget is about $500?

Seriously, I'd be happy to pay 10x - $5000 (or even 100x) if there's a reliable way to get an app to the top list.

Your marketing budget is very little, but you can still afford to buy some advertisements. Consider in-app advertisements on other iOS/Android games. Narrow your target audience (since your marketing budget is only $500), and put some ads on Google or Facebook.

To answer your question, the quickest way to do that is to pay companies to download your apps. There're lots of companies developing bots that can download many copies of the app for you. Those companies can also write automatic app-reviews for you.

However, if Apple or Google finds out, they will suspend your account.

Read about "Guerilla Marketing". The concept focuses on low-budget and no-budget marketing. Many of the marketing tactics are free; they require your time and energy instead of your money.  There are bunch of books about Guerilla Marketing. There are also websites, videos, articles, and probably Facebook groups devoted to the information. (I'm using a lot of the techniques to plan a marketing campaign for an app of my own right now.)
