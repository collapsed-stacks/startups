<p>I want to start a company in Caribbean but from what I've been told by relatives it seems difficult to find people who won't short your registers or set you up to be robbed.</p>

<p>To counteract this I've thought of having a 4 step hiring process:</p>

<ol>
<li>Have them fill out a basic application. Name, address, social security (or their equivalent), education etc. etc.</li>
<li>I'll do a background check with the police department.</li>
<li>Then I'll ask them to do a psychological test. You know the ones where companies ask things like "I work better in groups" followed by "least like me", "sort of like me" "most like me" etc.</li>
<li>Then I'll conduct an interview.</li>
</ol>

<p>Are my relatives exaggerating?
Do you guys find this excessive?
Do you guys have any experiences operating within the developing/3rd world as it related to hiring?</p>

<p>That's crazy. Practical questions to fit into your interviews (first-hand experience):</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Whether they're legally allowed to work. (You'll occasionally be surprised.)</p></li>
<li><p>Whether they're a criminal. (You really shouldn't care if the answer is yes, because if they admit to it they're probably reformed or trying to be. But you want a truthful answer.)</p></li>
<li><p>Whether they've another job. (Seriously... I once hired a chap in India who had three "full time" jobs.)</p></li>
<li><p>Whether they've proper health insurance. (Assuming having one is not automatic and you want to provide such. If you do provide it then, you'll get very loyal employees that refer other employees.)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Also ask for references -- and actually contact them. And if you're present, ideally ask around. (Caribbean islands area are small, so folks have reputations.)</p>
