For a start up company, how is automatic pay stub created?

I have seen free programs such as zenefits floating around would this auto pay be possible via the zenefits program?

What I mean by auto pay is for example:
Employee gives you his account number and routing number and the money gets deposited automatically.

Thanks for any help.

<p>Yes, you are looking for an online Payroll service. These services take care of the tax and reporting requirements of payroll, and automatic distribution of pay to your employees. </p>

<p>You can often setup online payroll with your business's bank, or your accounting software (for example, <a href="http://payroll.intuit.com" rel="nofollow">payroll.intuit.com</a> for QuickBooks users).</p>

<p>Personally, I recommend <a href="http://gusto.com" rel="nofollow">Gusto</a> (formerly ZenPayroll) because it is extremely easy to use, integrates perfectly with QuickBooks and other software, and also includes support for health care and other benefits. </p>
