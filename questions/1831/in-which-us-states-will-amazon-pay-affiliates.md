<p>An Amazon affiliate account enables you to receive a percentage of Amazon's sales revenue for buyers you refer to them. This also applies if you create an Amazon-based store on your site. However, some states in the US are not eligible for this payment. I'm looking for a list of states that <em>are</em>.</p>

<p>The Amazon Affiliate program is not available for residents of Arkansas, Colorado, Maine, Missouri, or Rhode Island. More details about the program are available in the <a href="https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/associates/agreement/" rel="nofollow">associate agreement</a>. The following excerpt from the link is relevant :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In addition, if at any time following your enrollment in the Program you become a resident of Arkansas, Colorado, Maine, Missouri, or Rhode Island, you will become ineligible to participate in the Program, and this Operating Agreement will automatically terminate, on the date you establish residency in that state. </p>
