I'm writing a business plan to try and get funding for my start up. It is my first mock up and I'm wondering if there is anything that would make it stand out. Also help  setting up a pitch would be great as well.

You have not given very much to work off in terms of what you plan to have in your business plan, so I will start from the beginning.

You should be using some form of the business model canvas for any new startup. If you already are doing this then great! If not then here are your options...

however, I would suggest using the modified version called...

The first step is to fill out one of those canvasses in full, this first time through will all be based on your one assumptions.

Once the first run through is complete it is time to go out and *validate those assumptions*. Hold **in-person interviews** with potential clients and ask questions to test your critical assumptions. Be ready to completely change your canvas along the way.

In short, what will make you stand out is not what you business model canvas looks like, but how it has evolved over time. This will show investors that you are constantly validating your new ideas and are on the road to creating a lean product that offers value to customers.

That which distinguishes your product from the competition IS the IDENTITY of your business. That identity MUST come from you, the founder. This is the essence of your idea.

A good formula for coming up with startup ideas is:

1. Go to work for a company.
1. Find the major sources of problems and pain.
1. Invent a solution to solve one or more of those problems.
1. Sell those solutions to the competition.
