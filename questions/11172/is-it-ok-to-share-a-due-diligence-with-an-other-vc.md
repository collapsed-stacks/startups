Simple question for the VC's out there... 

I just got a job to represent a VC and be his "eyes and ears" among Tech Startups. I just found a company that could be interesting to another VC so I connected both with each other. Is it a good business practice to propose a joint Due Diligence together, or should every VC do their own interview?

Doing your own due diligence is important.  What is of interest to you in the target company's files/accounting is likely going to be different than what the other person is looking at and considering, so relying on their data could be a problem.
