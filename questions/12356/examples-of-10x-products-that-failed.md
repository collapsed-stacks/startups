Peter Thiel famously states in Zero to One that a product should roughly be **10x better** than its closest substitute in order for it to be successful (among other factors that are equally important). Examples offered are Tesla, the iPhone, and Google search.

**Question:** Can anyone think of any recent 10x products that failed to create valuable businesses (where "valuable business" means a company worth at least $1B)? 

The only example I can think of is lytro.com (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lytro#Original_Lytro_Light_Field_Camera). But surely there are more examples.
