Let's say I've just inherited $500,000 dollars, and I want to invest it all into developing a social video app similar to Vine but with a unique twist.  I want the app to be social, fast, and very beautiful.  I also want an API developed to plug others into my networks data.  I'm a non-technical founder with 4 (app specific) patents and $500K for development.  

How expensive is it to make an app like Vine (front and backend)?  

Who are some of the ABSOLUTE best app development teams for hire?

It is impossible to answer this question as it is phrased. 
Usually there should be a proper project plan defined by you, and the company should run a feasibility test on it. After that you have a proper agreement. There are few company like Accenture, CSC, Capgemini, and Cognizan that can do the job, as well as a lot more "indie" companies with at least the same quality standard and capabilities.

Sad news for you is that you will need to be technical to assure code quality and scalability, design knowledge to evaluate usability and a lot of other skills that you may have overlooked at this stage. 

You can pay a company to be your production house, but you can't pay a company to be your CTO and COO.
