<p>Creating a buzz can certainly work in getting investor interest and raise your credibility. However, creating a buzz requires a good network, resources and time. As Denis pointed out, it doesn't happen overnight. </p>

<p>Another factor to keep in mind would be if the company is ready to be in the news. If you do not have a prototype or a product, then there may not much to cover in a press release. If you haven't secured patents then you may not be able to talk about unique aspects of your product. You also may not want to give away what you are doing to your competitors at an early stage.</p>
