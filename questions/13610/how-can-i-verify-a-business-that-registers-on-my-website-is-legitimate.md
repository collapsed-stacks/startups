For a website similar to Just Eat where businesses register to use their services, how can I verify that it is actually the business that is registering and not some random person doing it? I would like to do it in the least annoying way possible for the business owner. A few simple ideas I have thought of:

- Communicate a time where I would call the business number and they would confirm it is them that registered.

- Give them a random code to place somewhere on their social media (like a temporary comment on one of their posts).

What is the normal way to verify a business?

That's very dependent on where you live.

For example, in Germany you can look into the "Handelsregister", a list of companies. Maybe there is an equivalent in your country.

As a basic rule: you want your leads to as comfortable as possible.

You should simply let them register and test everything. After any kind of order, just call them to verify them. You also could introduce a checklist, when to call them: do they have a nice looking website? Is there a way to contact them? Does the user registered have an email with their domain? Etc.

Even if they don't order anything, call them and ask why. It costs nothing and may give you valuable feedback.

Also, try to differentiate between user and company. If a user is valid, you still can address him.

There are different methods of validate users: mail, social login, mobile, postal service, bank account (see PayPal) etc.

What ever you do: no methods will prevent every fraud. There is no 100% security. Minute mails, shared phone number service, fake social account. Even postal address and bank accounts can be acquired illegally etc.

As entrepreneur you should be aware that such things are possible.
