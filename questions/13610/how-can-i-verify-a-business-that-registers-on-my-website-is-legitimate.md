<p>For a website similar to Just Eat where businesses register to use their services, how can I verify that it is actually the business that is registering and not some random person doing it? I would like to do it in the least annoying way possible for the business owner. A few simple ideas I have thought of:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Communicate a time where I would call the business number and they would confirm it is them that registered.</p></li>
<li><p>Give them a random code to place somewhere on their social media (like a temporary comment on one of their posts).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>What is the normal way to verify a business?</p>

<p>That's very dependent on where you live.</p>

<p>For example, in Germany you can look into the "Handelsregister", a list of companies. Maybe there is an equivalent in your country.</p>

<p>As a basic rule: you want your leads to as comfortable as possible.</p>

<p>You should simply let them register and test everything. After any kind of order, just call them to verify them. You also could introduce a checklist, when to call them: do they have a nice looking website? Is there a way to contact them? Does the user registered have an email with their domain? Etc.</p>

<p>Even if they don't order anything, call them and ask why. It costs nothing and may give you valuable feedback.</p>

<p>Also, try to differentiate between user and company. If a user is valid, you still can address him.</p>

<p>There are different methods of validate users: mail, social login, mobile, postal service, bank account (see PayPal) etc.</p>

<p>What ever you do: no methods will prevent every fraud. There is no 100% security. Minute mails, shared phone number service, fake social account. Even postal address and bank accounts can be acquired illegally etc.</p>

<p>As entrepreneur you should be aware that such things are possible. </p>
