I was applying for a start up program, however I don't understand one the questions:

>What is your value proposition to the partner company?

I don't understand `partner company` term here, I know value proposition is the value that you are providing to your customers.

I am creating a messaging app that is connecting people; so the value I am providing to customer is to help them connecting, I don't know what is `partner company` refering to here.

Am I missing something, can someone help me on this?

The partners in this case would be the organizations who you would have to partner with in order to make your own company successful. 

Partner organizations would be required in various parts of your business model. Do you need distributors or retailers to get to your customer? These would be *channel* partners. If you run a manufacturing business and out source some manufacturing, the companies you out source to would be your partners. You might partner with other companies to take care of the supply chain, marketing, distribution, even production. 

It is important to think about your value prop for all these organizations. Why should they work with you over your competitors, who would need the same kind of partners? 

Take a look at this video, it helps a lot, though a bit simple.

Without knowing more details I am thinking that this start up program is perhaps in some cases setting up a partnership type relationship between different companies. that could be desireable in some cases as the more mature company would be expected to provide one or more of capital, experience, mentoring, etc. 

If that is the case you could be providing value to a partnering company by future revenue, preferential sofware/patent licencing etc.

Can't be sure without more context, but it sounds suspiciously like VC jargon for:

> What is your value proposition to us?

(Because much like lawyers they're -- literally -- a company of *partners* with supporting staff.)
