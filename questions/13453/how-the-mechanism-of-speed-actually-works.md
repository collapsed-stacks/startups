if we want to produce awesome products, then we have to make time for it. Sometimes 2 months or more.. sometimes even years. But that decrease the speed.. and if we want to just launch the product anyway, there probably will be no quality product </br>

we want to be able to produce complete products in really short time. how can that be done?

*we sell website packages.

The simpler the product, the quicker it usually is to create. Since you're creating website packages, you can simplify them by first creating website pieces that you can just assemble together, in varying combinations, to create the finished (or close-to-finished) product.

Start by identifying the kinds of "pieces" that your customers might want: various page templates, a shopping cart module, a database that stores website statistics, user account creation and sign in, etc. Then great generic versions of each of those that will work seamlessly with each other. All those pre-made and pre-tested pieces will greatly reduce the time it takes to produce a new custom site.

Another way to simplify and speed up the process is to have contractors on call for various tasks you might need, such as graphic design. If you have to hunt for a new contractor each time a client asks you for graphic design advice (for example), that will slow you down and create more work for you.
