<p>I'm considering using EarthClassMail as a virtual address and registered agent service. This would use the 94120 virtual zip code which is "located" in San Francisco and contained within the 94105 zip code. I wouldn't be operating in San Francisco, but I would receive my mail there.</p>

<p>My concern is that if I use a virtual address in San Francisco, I may be on the hook for SF business tax. San Francisco does have the Mid-Market Tax Break (Twitter Tax Break) and I'm not sure if this would apply to a virtual address.</p>

A person is "engaging in business within the City," within the meaning of this Article, if that person meets one or more of the following conditions:</p>
  
  <p>&hellip;</p>
  
  <p>(b)   An employee, representative or agent of the person maintains a fixed place of business within the City for the benefit or partial benefit of the person; or</p>
  
  <p>&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since your agent, the "virtual office" provider, maintains a fixed place of business within the City for your partial benefit, you are indeed subject to city registration and taxes.</p>
