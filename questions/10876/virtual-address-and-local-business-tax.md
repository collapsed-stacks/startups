I'm considering using EarthClassMail as a virtual address and registered agent service. This would use the 94120 virtual zip code which is "located" in San Francisco and contained within the 94105 zip code. I wouldn't be operating in San Francisco, but I would receive my mail there.

My concern is that if I use a virtual address in San Francisco, I may be on the hook for SF business tax. San Francisco does have the Mid-Market Tax Break (Twitter Tax Break) and I'm not sure if this would apply to a virtual address.

From the [San Francisco Business and Tax Regulations Code](http://library.amlegal.com/nxt/gateway.dll/California/business/article6commonadministrativeprovisions?f=templates$fn=altmain-nf.htm$q=[field%20folio-destination-name:%276.2-12%27]$x=Advanced#JD_6.2-12):

A person is "engaging in business within the City," within the meaning of this Article, if that person meets one or more of the following conditions:
> 
> &hellip;
> 
>    (b)   An employee, representative or agent of the person maintains a fixed place of business within the City for the benefit or partial benefit of the person; or
> 
> &hellip;

Since your agent, the "virtual office" provider, maintains a fixed place of business within the City for your partial benefit, you are indeed subject to city registration and taxes.
