<p>To be a good entrepreneur and succeed in your start-up and beyond, or simply to be good in business and finance fields, one needs to read some good books and study some good topics.</p>

<p>The problem is that there are many sources out there and no one can read everything. </p>

<p>So it would be amazing if someone can list the titles of the most influential books that can boost you to success.</p>
