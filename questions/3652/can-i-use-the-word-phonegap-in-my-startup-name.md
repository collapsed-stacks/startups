<p>I checked out the <a href="http://phonegap.com/about/license/" rel="nofollow">License page</a> but am not sure. I see <a href="http://phonegapexperts.com/" rel="nofollow">Phonegap Experts</a> doing it, is that legal?</p>

<p>To add on to blunders' answer, Adobe does explicitly forbid you from using Phonegap in any app names. In Phonegap Build's <a href="http://wwwimages.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/legal/servicetou/PGB_TOU-en_US-20140618_1200.pdf" rel="nofollow">additional terms</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>PhoneGap is a trademark of Adobe. You may not use PHONEGAP or GAP in the title of any application built using PhoneGap or the PhoneGap Build service.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That being said, this clause only affects app names, not company names, although as blunders answer states this still does not give you any rights to the Phonegap trademark, and I'd recommend you don't use it.</p>

<p>The code is licensed as open source under the ASF, but this does not give you any rights to the Phonegap trademark which is still owned by Adobe.</p>

<p>PhoneGap is a trademark owned by Adobe, as such, terms of it's use are subject to change at their will unless otherwise agreed to in writing. </p>

<p>Highly suggest you don't violate their rights or build a brand on a trademark you don't own.</p>
