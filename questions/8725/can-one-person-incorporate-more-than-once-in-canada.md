If a single person is part of multiple independent startups, and each one wants to do an incorporation, can that one person common to those startups, have multiple incorporations? What are the advantages and disadvantages?

Persons do not "have incorporations". Corporations are created as independent legal entities and issue shares that can be granted to, or purchased by, persons. Your question essentially translates to: Can one person own shares of multiple corporations, to which the answer is obviously yes.

Yes. You can do it. But do it if it is really necessary. But in such cases you will need to consider the tax part carefully.
