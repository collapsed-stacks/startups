A lot of people call themselves CEO, President, etc. I feel like those are too formal for my business. I feel like Owner is too informal. Anyways, I own a local digital marketing business.

I am a sole proprietor. Any ideas on what I should call myself?

Titles only really matter for a few formal situations. For example, some laws might require "an officer" to sign a corporate agreement. Other laws might require a corporation to report people in certain corporate roles yearly. In those rare circumstances, you need to maintain the required title(s). Other than that, titles are mainly used to stroke people's egos. They are also often used as an employment incentive because they cost companies nothing to give out but are valued highly by employees.

It sounds like you are in a creative field which gives you the freedom to have fun with your titles. You can call yourself _Chief Marketing Guru_, _The Boss_, _Social Media Champion_, _Marketing Expert_, or anything else you come up with. Don't feel the need to model yourself after some large corporation. It's your business so you set the rules. Find something comfortable and go with it.

BTW, thank you for your service.

My business cards and all other customer facing documentation identify as "Senior Solutions Architect/Engineer".  For all my formal corporate 'officer required' items I am the CEO.

I have found that putting Owner, President, CEO, etc. in front of customers directly seems to form unwarranted expectations about additional services they may receive in favor of other customers.
