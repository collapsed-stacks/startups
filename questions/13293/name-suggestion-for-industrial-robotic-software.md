I am developing a software for industrial robot simulation, control, vision, calibration, etc. I use python and QT and a graphic engine. I am looking for a good name for my software, something like RobotStudio or RobotMaster which already exist. Please give me some suggestions!! Thanks :)

<p>This question does shed light on a common difficulty in modern startups: there are so many companies and products, the remaining choices can be extremely limited.  </p>

<p>This is a huge problem in my sector, games. What I found was that all of the fundamental words that describe my game action are taken, as are most combinations.  It gets worse when you get into web domain names, in that the concise ones with the fewest letters will almost all be taken.</p>

<p>Trademark will also be a big issue if your product is successful.  Instead of suggesting name ideas, I'm going to outline the steps I have to take in choosing a potential product name, and hopefully that will shed some light on steps you should be taking.</p>

<ol>
<li>Brainstorm to find a name that has the meaning you wish to convey</li>
<li>Ask yourself: Is it catchy? Is it an accurate description?  Is it easy to type?</li>
<li>Google it and see what comes up.  If nothing: </li>
<li>Google it in regard to my <em>product type</em> (game) to make sure. </li>
<li>Check the marketplaces for my product (in my case, Steam, App Store and Google Play)</li>
<li>Check for domain names using the name</li>
</ol>

<p>If all of these come up clear, I take the most important step</p>

<ol start="7">
<li><p>Check the Trademark database for pre-existing registrations.  (In the US, you can <a href="https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks-application-process/search-trademark-database" rel="nofollow noreferrer">use this link</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Assuming success in the prior steps, are there existing products in my market with similar names or trademarks which <em>could</em> cause confusion?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>As you can see, it's a fair amount of work. In my case, it was a process that took more than a year to find a <em>serviceable</em> name.  <em>(All the "perfect" names were already taken by highly inferior products;)</em></p>

<p><strong>At the end of the day, the Trademark availability is the absolutely critical factor.  If you can't secure a trademark, you could have big problems if your product has any success.</strong></p>
