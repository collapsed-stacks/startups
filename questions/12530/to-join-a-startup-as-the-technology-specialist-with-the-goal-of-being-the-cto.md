I have just been offered to join a startup as the technical expert with the idea of me becoming the CTO.

We are to have another meeting to discuss details.

None of the co-founders are technical. What I would like to understand more is the following suggestion made to me: "We want you to start with the ownership of the technological solution, say 1 day's work per week, and grow into the role as CTO".

To me it sounds like they don't really know the extent of the tech work.

What should I ask in the follow-up meeting, and what should I reasonably ask for as compensation? I understand that my options are to ask for a paycheck or equity.

I don't know these people since before.

UPDATE:

It turns out that the project was not only poorly planned, but lacking inhouse technical expertise and understanding of the solution they own (and bought..) The role was defined as growing into a CTO role. So here is my input (and advice to anyone facing a similar situation):

 - Do not accept "growing into" a CTO role part-time. Either there are clear requirements from the start what the CTO will be responsible for, or you are better off walking away.
 - If there is no budget from the start, that shows that the business owners are simply not that business-minded, and hence, another reason to walk away.

Interesting question.

I have been in this kind of scenario before.

> idea of me becoming the CTO

Do you want to be CTO? because if you are not sure about the scope, you should not agree to an appointment.

I think you can probably check with them about their current state of ideation. And how far do you believe in the idea? There could be changes, that the idea fails, business model changes or even worse they stop the company.

If you know the idea that they are working on, you may do your own research and update them about the amount of work required. For example

If it an e-commerce platform, and you need to be working more than once a week, you can let them know. And then they shall decide how to bring it forward.

> To me it sounds like they don't really know the extent of the tech work.

You said, they are not technical, so I would not expect them to know. And that's the reason they are hiring you. It's your job as a "technology specialist" to let them know what is feasible, realistic and practical.

Lastly, being CTO or anything else, you are the first "technical" person in the company so you will always have that "importance". 

Best of Luck!

Hope this helps.

Since they are being vague about your role, you could simple ask them to give you specifics about your career path within the company, along with dates of each step, and how much you will be paid at each step.

The scenario you are in is pretty much where most of the CTO's will be. Not all founders can be Tech savvy, and they will need someone in the team who can be responsible for technical decisions and leading technical teams forward. 

You need to understand startup's mission and then you need to assess how much do you believe in it.
Make your decision based on your allegiances with their mission and whether or not you are technically capable of leading technical teams towards the goal. Obviously the perks that come along with it should be enough to keep you motivated
