<p>Three people are establishing a startup; each will be acting as one of the following: CEO, CTO, COO. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>What are some of the common structures for such scenarios?</p></li>
<li><p>How much equity should each get equally divided?</p></li>
<li><p>How many shares is that?</p></li>
<li><p>What is commonly left for investors and advisors and future hires in the pie?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I know every startup is different and should be tailored accordingly; but I was wondering if there are more common set ups that are favored or utilized?</p>

<p>Here's an article I really like that talks about this:</p>

<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/isaacsanders/1653078" rel="nofollow">https://gist.github.com/isaacsanders/1653078</a></p>

<p>Basically, you divide everything equally at the top level of management so that the founders feel evenly yoked.</p>

<p>Then there are typically 5-6 layers of employees added during the growth period (typically 5 years).  By the endâ€” founders will own 50%, and each layer splits 10%.  Any money raised by investors dilutes the existing shares.</p>

<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/isaacsanders/1653078" rel="nofollow">I like the Isaac Sanders article @Josh provided in his answer</a>.</p>

<p>The only way I can think to improve upon in is to consider the scenario when it is clear that the co-founders should <em>not</em> receive an equal number of shares. For example, if one quits his job to work full time and another does not. Or, it's one co-founder's idea <em>and</em> code and the other just does some presentations. (Writing code is about a million times more difficult and more important to success.)</p>

<p>In that case, my favorite method is to actually pay co-founders for their work in the form of shares. For example, let's agree that writing code pays 100 shares per day. Doing a presentation pays 1 share per day. Something like that. Then keep people accountable for the number of shares they earn by posting the ownership on a shared Google Sheet for transparency and showing their work product to give the other co-founders an opportunity to object if they think someone earned shares without doing the appropriate amount of work.</p>

<p>And make a cutoff period when one can raise objections about share allocation. Say, two weeks. So if there is no objection after two weeks of issuance, it's a done deal. No more arguing about it. You had your chance. Again, a shared Google Sheet helps a lot with this for <em>transparency</em>.</p>
