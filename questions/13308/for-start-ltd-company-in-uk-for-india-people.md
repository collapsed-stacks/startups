You could use a virtual office service to use as a registered address that you would use to list your new company with companies house. You can then open a business bank account from this address and many online-only providers exist as high street banks may wish to see you in person. To get a UK phone number you can use a VoIP(SIP) service that will allow you to receive calls over the Internet to either a computer or a smart phone.  

Given that you are not located in the UK it may be difficult for you to obtain credit (funds) and you may need to look at local options.
