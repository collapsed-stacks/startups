<p>I'm looking to target small to mid-size client companies with annual sales of about 10M-50M.  What are my options, or how do you suggest, I go about finding companies that meet within demographic?</p>

<p>Well, I do not know how it works in the country where you are. But here in Brazil, we can access the "Junta Comercial" website and search all companies in a certain area, from this we can conduct a survey of the company's public financial reports and estimate the customer base</p>

<p>I was able to find the information I need by visiting my local library.  They gave me online (i.e. from home) access to referenceUSA, which has the data I need.</p>
