<p>I have seen profiles like the "Board of Directors", "Director", etc; which the investors are given after mostly leading a major round.</p>

<p>But, what exactly is the meaning of "Board Observer".  I have seen this on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattcohler" rel="nofollow">Matt Cohler's LinkedIn</a>, where he assumes that role in Uber, Zendesk, etc.</p>

<p>The key difference between someone a being a Board Member and a Board Observer is that <strong>the Observer does not have the ability to vote on decisions</strong>. This isn't to say that person may or may not have a say in the content of discussion as many company boards - in particular start-ups can have board meetings often and make decisions without voting. So your question about what they do is mainly going to be offering advice and guidance. </p>

<p>Some boards operate with <strong>Silent</strong> Observers; people who are in attendance, but cannot say anything either as what they say may undesirably determine the outcome of any decisions being made.</p>

<p>But again, the key is that they cannot vote when a motion is brought to the floor.</p>

<p>Noting the position title on a profile page or business card means this person is involved enough with company to at least have a professional relationship with one of the board members and his opinion into the company's operations is valued. Not only that, but it is also a good indicator of the kind of influence this person has and their level of interest in a company.</p>
