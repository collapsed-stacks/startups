If someone is making advancements in engineering, science, chemistry etc and have want to move there research into real working prototypes, will university help make it? I heard this is a great way to get a prototype made. Anyone had experience with this?

P.S Do you also have to go to the school?

Do not worry about it. Instead, go ask. The worst you can hear is "no," and if you hear that, it's not the only university in existence. Furthermore, if we're talking about actual university with grad programs, you might be able to talk one of the students in their later years into helping you. I wouldn't expect something for free, but that doesn't always  mean you need cash either.
