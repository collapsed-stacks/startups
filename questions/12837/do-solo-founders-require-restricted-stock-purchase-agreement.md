At the moment I'm a single founder. I'm planning to seek 3rd party investments in the future.

Do i require restricted stock purchase agreement now when I issue stocks to myself?

No.

As a sole founder having restricted stock would put you in a vesting agreement with yourself. This is not entirely necessary.

The restricted agreement is often used to vest co-founders and ensure that all co-founders are likely to commit to being involved over a certain period.

When it comes to investment, it may be that the investor wishes to put vesting periods and restrictions in place rather than having to change ones that currently exist to fit their desires. I'm against vesting periods personally so would prefer to deal with them only when I have to.

Only benefit I can see of restricted stock earlier is the gamble that the investor wants a vesting period and is happy with yours. This would mean that your vesting period would already have begun by the time you received investment.
