I have an idea, how to support people with innovative business ideas to make them *actually* happen.

In order to validate my problem hypothesis, I want to talk to real people, who might be struggling to bring their ideas to life. However, I wonder how to identify potential customers and where to get in contact with them?

I understand, that I could go to a gym, if I was planning to talk to people who want to get in shape. If a was planning a new dentist's surgery management app, I would research local dentist surgeries and ask for interviews there. But in my case, when the idea is not focussed on a certain industry but rather on a set of customer's characteristics - I'm struggling to identify customers for an interview. How would I identify such customers best? If not possible, how would I test my assumption still, before developing a solution?

Thanks,
Bunjip

there are few options to start with:

 * join to online groups (in facebook...) with these interests
 * local educational/training centers with business courses
 * make simple landing page with questionnaire and buy traffic (google ads) for certain keywords

+1 to Pok√©mon. 

Make assumptions, note them down, and profile the target segments  into specific groups of people. Attend meetups against those segments, etc. Aggregate the data with the assumptions in mind so that the data can be normalized.
