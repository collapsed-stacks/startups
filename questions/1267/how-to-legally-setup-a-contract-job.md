I want to make some tutorial video. For the context, I can handle them. However, I am not a native speaker. I want to find a person to use his/her voice in the video. At this point, I  think it will take 6 hours for me to teach the person the context of the tutorial video and another 6 hours for him/her to present the context, so that I can record it.

However, I don't know exactly the amount of time. I could not easily judge a person of his/her ability of learning at the 1st time we meet. At the same time, I don't want that he/she only finish the half of the project. If I only paid to pay $120 for the whole project and it takes more than 20 hours to finish, how I can protect the whole project would fall into my budget? Can I set up a contact with a person for $120 to get everything done? Even if he/she needs to spend 20 hours, I don't need to worry about the minimum wage in California? 

Note: I do NOT have a company

<p><a href="http://www.fiverr.com/" rel="nofollow">Fiverr</a> is your friend. Your project is made up of components that could be done by specialists. You have a script of so many words that needs to be interpreted into great English. You need someone to read that script over your tutorial video. You need someone to edit the audio and video together to your instructions, moving this bit of speech forward a second, and losing that sentence that doesn't work. You're done.</p>

<p>Or if you need the final result to be recorded live over the screen capture, you'll break it down a different way.</p>

<p>Some gigs won't work out - but that's the joy of Fiverr. Want unique background music? Hire two or three people, pay for all of the gigs, but just use the best. You spent $15 on gigs, instead of $1,500 on a custom music project.</p>
