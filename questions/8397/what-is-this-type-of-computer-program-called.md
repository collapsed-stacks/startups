Just as how there are Content Management Systems (CMS) programs, Customer Relationship Management (CRM) programs, etc....

What is the name of an application that enables employees to update tickets, pass a task through a business-defined workflow, and allow trackable changes?

For example, a tv repair company might have several users: the sales person creates the ticket and describes what problem the tv is experiencing; then a technical accepts the ticket and performs an initial analysis of the problem; then a tier2 technical investigates and resolves the problem; a QA person then confirms the problem is fixed; and finally a delivery staff member brings the tv back to the customer. The whole time there is an electronic ticket that organizes the notes on this customer's tv, and passes the task through the workflow from one person to the next.

What is this type of application called?

<p>We use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jira_(software)" rel="nofollow">Jira</a> for these kind of things, and it's described as an "issue tracking product" on wikipedia.</p>

The system responsible for crating issue tickets is sometimes called the 
**Issue tracking system**  (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issue_tracking_system)


At times this is not a standalone program and can be part of a larger  
**Project management software** (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management_software)
 


if you just need the ticket aspect, you would need to first identify how you would use it, and how much you want to maintain it.

There are several options to consider for a Issue tracking system:

1. Do you want the software hosted on your own sever
1.a. If Yes, Do you have other locations where it would be accessed (Web or other offices)
1.b. If no, would you like to hosted on the internet?

There are pros and cons to both, and simply searching the internet will help you ultimately decide which solution is right for you.



From your question, it sound like you want an entire **Project Management Software**

This software can be used for many parts of your company including (Depending on the software):

* Tracking Different Projects (Due dates, people who work on them and hours)
* Tracking different milestones/tasks within a projects (when they are completed and by whom)
* Tracking and updating issues and tickets for bugs and repairs
* Tracking Customers information
* Tracking GPS of trucks and routes
...and so on..


Good luck

<p>I used RedMine before and it was a very detailed system which is free but I can't compare with the others as I didn't try the other one. A list and comparison of "<strong>issue tracking systems</strong>" is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_issue-tracking_systems" rel="nofollow" title="Wikipedia">here</a></p>

The middle part of this is actually called Business Process Management. There is an open source web application called ProcessMaker that can help with this. It takes some time to learn how it works.

From an organizational perspective, you can set groups and allow only certain groups to see certain parts of the processes, who it is waiting on, et cetera. However, it takes time to define and delineate these processes, consulting with the right people, and then more time to create those processes in the system. 

It does help in eliminating redundant hand-offs in business processes. The system acts as the middle-man. There is also a paid version of it. You could create a front-end on this that is a bit more user-friendly. It all depends on who is needing to use which part of the system.

<p>I don't think this kind of software was well diffused in occident, yet you may find similar softwares in japan for large scale kanban methodology.</p>

<p>I would name that kind of software <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_manufacturing" rel="nofollow">Just-in-Time</a> Production Management Software</strong></p>

<p>If you want a precise answer, you may have to contact a company practicing Toyotism</p>

<p>I would call this project management software. A project is simply an activity that lasts for a finite length of time. It was created with a specific goal in mind and it has both a start date and an end date. And <a href="https://tallyfy.com/project-management/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">project management</a> is simply the active planning and monitoring of these activities.</p>

<p>Workflow software can be extremely helpful in managing the scope and execution of your project. This will ensure that everyone on the team will have a clear understanding of their roles and your project will have a greater chance of success.</p>

<p>There are great solutions, thought of sharing mine too.</p>

<p>Our team uses <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/team-services/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Visual Studio Team Services</a>, which keeps tracks of backlog to deadlines. Allowing you to follow any product development methodology such as Agile, Scrum. </p>

<p>Not only that it allows you to track if the team is working on the right item at the right time. It has concepts such as story points, estimated time. Which then can be visually represented in a graphical manner(burn-out chart)</p>

<p>We have been using this for around 2-years now and we have just seen it getting better. As we are tech-startup, TFS might suit us. Because it tracks code, testing, and also the continuous delivery of the software.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
