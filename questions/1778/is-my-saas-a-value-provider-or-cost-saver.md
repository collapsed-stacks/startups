<p>I have a SaaS that let's people extract data from PDF and Video files. The reason I'm asking is I want to know on what side of the fence I am on in order to know how to price and market my SaaS better. </p>

<p>Common theme about all of my customers is that.</p>

<ul>
<li>They are already aware of the pdf and video files that they need to extract data from.</li>
<li>They have tried other methods such as manual or paying someone.</li>
<li>They have successfully been able to extract data using my SaaS.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now I charge an "all you can extract", unlimited plan for my three plans (small, medium, large). The only difference is the number of workers as you go up the plan. The more workers, the faster your overall data extraction.</p>

<p>The price range starts from a few hundred dollars a month to a thousand dollars a month.</p>

<p>I am guessing that the main value from my SaaS comes from saving people lot of manual and time consuming labor. Am I a cost saver?</p>

<p>I am also seeing that the data that is extracted is of value to the customer, but they chose the data they wanted to extract from a resource they already knew ahead of time. Am I a value provider in this case?</p>

<p>If I am a cost saver, then ultimately, is lower monthly plan or higher monthly plan the answer? My competitors charge similar price but they are metered. These folks come to me because of my unlimited plan. The equivalent of hiring a human and paying wages is also unmetered but much more expensive (I assume around $1000 for an intern). Does it make sense to market the time saving features from this angle? "why hire 5 interns when you can pay ten times less than that with our SaaS" ?</p>

<p>If I am a value provider, then is a feature based monthly plan the answer? Small plan can only extract PDF. Medium and Large plan can extract Videos. Folks need to segment themselves in to the features they need based on the data they already have that needs to be extracted. The data they chose ahead of time is valuable and they want to extract as much as possible. Marketing vectors from this angle appear difficult because it's hard to know what data they are looking to extract since it's specific to each customers and there is a wide variance on what they find valuable. Some guy wants scientific data because they are a school, some guy wants linguistic data because he's building a service etc.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>I would say that cost savings is a form of value. </p>

<p>But that is just one of your potential value propositions.  </p>

<p>Think about some others..</p>

<h2>Quality</h2>

<p>What is your accuracy rate? People are pretty rotten at data harvesting from PDF and video.  If your application error rate is lower than that of people, that's a stand alone value proposition.</p>

<h2>Speed</h2>

<p>You're faster than a person, but are you faster than your competitors? Can you run the video at faster than single speed? Can you split the video up in to pieces and run it in parallel?</p>

<h2>Vertical-Enablement</h2>

<p>Do you have particular expertise in health care or financial services or travel or some other business?   I work for a mortgage company, and for us the value proposition is entirely about what they can do to clean up the data and inject it directly into our business processes.</p>
