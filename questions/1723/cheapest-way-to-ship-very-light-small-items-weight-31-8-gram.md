<p>I am importing lots of 200-500 Nerf Elite darts from China (less than a third of the price in the U.S.)<br>
They are valued at around one dollar and fifty cents; and I'm selling for 20 or so cents more.    </p>

<p>Refer to the image for all the dimensions.
(I am selling K-type (the normal ones in the refill packs)) </p>

<p>How can I ship without going way over the initial cost?</p>

<p>Shipping is invariably expensive when not done in bulk, because you need to cover the fuel, storage, and labor costs to get a package shipped from A to B.</p>

<p>Your options are basically to:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Ship the product in reasonable quantities. Don't send one pack of recharges; ship ten or whatever makes financial sense.</p></li>
<li><p>Buy the needed shipping and packaging in bulk. Don't buy ten stamps, etc.; buy a few thousand or whatever the sweet spot is for you and your budget.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Alternatively, Amazon, Overstock, and presumably a few more companies can do the fulfillment for you. You can then focus on finding buyers and let them worry about the rest:</p>

<p>China Post. My packages are less than 50g and I negotiated very low price, less than $2 per package for shipping with my supplier.</p>
