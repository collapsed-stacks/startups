I am importing lots of 200-500 Nerf Elite darts from China (less than a third of the price in the U.S.)   
They are valued at around one dollar and fifty cents; and I'm selling for 20 or so cents more.    

Refer to the image for all the dimensions.
(I am selling K-type (the normal ones in the refill packs)) 


![dimensions][1]

How can I ship without going way over the initial cost?

Shipping is invariably expensive when not done in bulk, because you need to cover the fuel, storage, and labor costs to get a package shipped from A to B.

Your options are basically to:

1. Ship the product in reasonable quantities. Don't send one pack of recharges; ship ten or whatever makes financial sense.

2. Buy the needed shipping and packaging in bulk. Don't buy ten stamps, etc.; buy a few thousand or whatever the sweet spot is for you and your budget.

Alternatively, Amazon, Overstock, and presumably a few more companies can do the fulfillment for you. You can then focus on finding buyers and let them worry about the rest:

China Post. My packages are less than 50g and I negotiated very low price, less than $2 per package for shipping with my supplier.
