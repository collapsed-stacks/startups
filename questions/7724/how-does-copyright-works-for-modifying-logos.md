For sometime I had an idea for making a product that later I intend to sell. The thing is, it is based of somebodies work, so you can call it fan work. Let's say I want to draw a painting with this Star Trek logo [![enter image description here][1]][1]

I want to sell it. Will it be considered a copyright infringement? And then again, if I will change it a bit, like, add some scratch marks or additional symbols, will it technically be my product, or will it be still protected by Copyright? What if I take only the logo, without text, will it be considered my work of art? And say, what if I take this logo, and create a show called Star Way, is the show considered mine? Yes, it will be an obvious rip off, but will it be legally original?

I hope I made myself clear.

<p>All of those would clearly be copyright infringement.  All the possibilities you mention would be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_work" rel="nofollow">derivative works</a> because you are modifying someone else's copyrighted work.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use" rel="nofollow">Fair use</a> is a pretty big exception to copyright, but since it looks like you are primarily looking to profit from your derivative works, it is unlikely that it would be fair use.</p>

<p>Some authors welcome derivative works.  For example, see <a href="https://kindleworlds.amazon.com/" rel="nofollow">Kindle Worlds</a>, but most authors, especially well known authors do not.</p>

<p>You probably can't do what you want without infringing someone else's copyright.  Though if you look on Etsy, people do this all the time.</p>
