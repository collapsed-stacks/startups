<p>I am about to start the process of marketing a new venture (video production for corporate and media)
It is a field that I have been interested in for years and have a selection of good equipment and knowledge of the processes.</p>

<p>However I have no "Showreel" - I have no videos that I would really want to show to a prospective client, as I have only operated as a hobbyist/experimental until now.</p>

<p>Its not really possible to make a showreel of (for example the inside of a manufacturing plant) as I would not be able to get the required access, and then I would not want to pigeon-hole myself to a particular type of production.</p>

<p>What are my options for getting off the ground? 
Is my only real option to offer free work? maybe a "pay if you like it" service for the first few clients... But then how would I market that?! </p>

<p>You have to hustle some work. If you have the skills you can do the work, so you will have a happy client and something for your portfolio. </p>

<p>Best way to find clients starting out is word of mouth, local to you.</p>

<p>Working for free is more acceptable for a charitable cause but otherwise avoid it.</p>

<p>Ask everyone, and every social interaction you have be thinking whether there could be a client out of it somewhere along the line. Be patient and don't be rude. Good luck.</p>

<p>Approach potential clients - but you need to be creative in your words.</p>

<p>Basically, you need to imply the reward is for your client, not you.  The reward is indirectly in your favour.</p>

<p>Ideas that come to mind</p>

<ol>
<li>Does client have a new product/service to promote?</li>
<li>Does client have an existing product/service to promote in a new market?</li>
<li>If they are a manufacturing site, perhaps offer to create a "how do they do this?" sort of video.</li>
<li>Consider approaching your local city hall/Mayor/Police/Firestation/school that you would like to showcase their contribution with a video on youtube. You would offer your service for free and the City/Mayor gets final approval. The end result could be used to promote investment into the city (from business, or people considering moving to a nearby city instead being persuaded to move to your city).</li>
<li>Approach a wedding planner or non-branded respected hotel and ask if you can help promote their services.</li>
<li>A popular music or theater might be interested in showcasing their facilities (it would get you a few free back stage passes no doubt).</li>
<li>Seek out a marketing company - they have clients and this could save you some leg work and help build reputation all in one go - offer to do a couple of videos pro bono for them. Don't do three or four or five. Don't let someone abuse your offer. They will profit from your hard work, so know where to draw the line.</li>
</ol>

<p>The benefits of the above are clear to the folk in front of the camera - they are also indirectly good for you to build recognition.</p>

<p>Note, City Hall might decline as they might have legal requirements that encourage them to put such an offer out to tender as you would be under-cutting the competition by offering to do work for free.</p>

<p>I disagree with one item that @andrew-welch says in his answer - Charitable work is very worthwhile (I have worked at food banks sorting/distributing food donations). They don't have big budgets.</p>

<p>Who ever undertakes your services, make sure they value/respect your time.  My experience is some folk who know you work for free can sometimes not respect/value your time. Be respectful if you find someone fails to meet an agreed timeline (like an interview or give you a tour at a pre-agreed time). Explain to them that you accept that events can change the course of the working day and their time is important, but so to is yours. You appreciate their time and you ask that respect goes both ways. Say it with a smile so they don't think you are throwing your toys out of the pram.</p>

<p>You need to do all the thinking. Anyone can point and shoot a video camera, you need to explain to them what story you hope to share with the viewer, and explain how you hope to achieve it. Draw up something like a project plan (sketch board?) whereby you its clear on who you can talk to and when and if they don't give you the time, who can you reach out to to address issues. If you want someone to treat you as a professional, then you must focus on being a professional.</p>

<p>Be clear that they will have full authority to approve your work before its made available publicly and you will calm any of their outstanding concerns.</p>

<p>If anyone does not want to be within camera shot, have them wear an arm band so you can blur them post production.</p>

<p>Best of luck!</p>
