<p>A couple years ago, I started an IT security consulting business as a freelancer. I obtained a decent share of clients though applying on contractual work. They usually review my CV and require me to work on site for the duration of the contract.</p>

<p>However, I would like to start expanding my business. Since I can only work on one project at a time, I would like to leverage my time by building a team. How could I convince businesses to have my employees do the work (specially head-hunting firms). My goal would be to find new contracts, manage the work load and oversee client satisfaction.</p>

<p>When I think about other fields like construction or landscaping, the clients usually take it for granted that someone else will be doing the work. At the end, clients are usually happy when work is done on time with high quality standards.</p>

<p>You could start by finding others like you and putting their CV's on your site and converting your site from a solo guy site to a team site.</p>

<p>You could list all your profiles and work, like on a design site, but only for 3-4 people. This way your clients could select the person who they want the work to be done. That is if you want to be completely open about the change.</p>

<p>You would transform your personal brand from John Doe the developer into John Doe and his team of people. This could mean a lot of different business since many companies like to work with teams and many don't. So you'd probably keep the current ones, but you'd see changes in the type of clients you'll get. This also could mean bigger projects.</p>
