<p>Firstly, please bear with me of my English writing as it's not my native language. I have developed a mathematical model for a file compression algorithm, it doesn't use any other available file compression algorithms (my own pure method), this can compress any type of file regardless of their file format (.wmv, .mkv, .txt) and initial tests are done with a software developer. Do you think I can sell the algorithm to some software company &amp; what kind of maximum price should I expect? And should I patent this first? The data are as follows. If this is not the correct stack-exchange site to post this kind of question, please be kind enough to guide me without down-voting this. </p>

<pre><code>Speed: 3.0 GHZ Dual core
RAM: 8GB
File type: MKV
File size: 742 Megabytes
Compressed output: 3.75 Megabytes
Time taken for full compression: 8.34 minutes
Compression ratio: 0.5% 
Speed on this computer: 1.48 MegaBytes/second
Time taken for decompression: 4.55 minutes
</code></pre>

<p>When I compress all other file types (.mkv, .wmv, .mp3, .exe, .zip etc) yields similar results as above.</p>

<p>If you are getting a 20:1 lossless compression on multiple file types then that is worth some money.     </p>

<p>The best for text today is 7:1.   <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Data_Compression/Evaluating_Compression_Effectiveness" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Data Compression/Evaluating Compression Effectiveness</a></p>

<p>That number is almost too good to believe.  </p>

<p>Run some more tests and if you are getting anything over 10:1 with a lossless compression then get a patent as it is worth some money. 
After you validate then post on <a href="https://patents.stackexchange.com/">patents.stackexchange</a>.  Don't post the algorithm or share it with anyone until you have talked to an attorney.  </p>
