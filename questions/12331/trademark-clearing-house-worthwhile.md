<p>Is it worth my while to protect my company name in the <a href="http://trademark-clearinghouse.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Trademark Clearing House (TMCH)</a>, which is an agency that is connected to ICANN and says they protect the rights of the trademark holders against domain name registration using your trademark?</p>

<p>We registered with them a couple of years ago and apart from taking $US150 / year or so, nothing really seems to happen.</p>

<p>This article talks through the reasons for doing it, but we have had no engagement with the TMCH with our trademark over the last two years.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any firsthand experience of the value of this service? </p>
