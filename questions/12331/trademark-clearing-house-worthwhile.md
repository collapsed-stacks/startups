Is it worth my while to protect my company name in the [Trademark Clearing House (TMCH)][1], which is an agency that is connected to ICANN and says they protect the rights of the trademark holders against domain name registration using your trademark?

We registered with them a couple of years ago and apart from taking $US150 / year or so, nothing really seems to happen.

This article talks through the reasons for doing it, but we have had no engagement with the TMCH with our trademark over the last two years.

Does anyone have any firsthand experience of the value of this service?
