<p>I want to make suits of steel armor that have MANY outward facing blades. I would start with armor that is the typical depiction of a knight's armor, then weld blades onto it. The blades would be positioned so that they would not make collision with other parts of the suit. Example: no blades on the inside of the legs or on the insides of joints. The idea is that no harm would come to the user by design.</p>

<p>If I could ensure that a user of such a suit would not be injured, could I sell these suits without dealing with the caucus race we call the American justice system?</p>

<p>I've seen things that could potentially be dangerous sold as 'art'. I'm betting that it would be difficult and uncommon to prohibit sales of your work if you sold it as such. </p>

<p>However, that doesn't mean that you wouldn't face legal liability if someone was hurt from it. The best thing to do would be to talk with a lawyer about the potential liability and relevant statues in your area of business. They might be able to advise you what sort of insurance, if any, to purchase.</p>

<p>Although, if this is going to be your main source of livelihood you might want to consider generating some startup money to actually pay a decent lawyer rather than finding one willing to barter with you. Not to say there are <em>no</em> good lawyers who might barter, just that I bet they are hard if not impossible to find.</p>

<p>Also, as a quick disclaimer my legal experience is limited so obviously take anything I say with a grain or two of salt.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>This would differ state to state, but I can assure you it'd be illegal in at least a couple. You'd also have massive liability issues.</p>

<p>Before you do anything you should discuss it with a lawyer who has experience in the knife/sword laws in your state.</p>
