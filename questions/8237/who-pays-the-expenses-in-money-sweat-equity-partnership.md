<p>I'm starting a business with a friend, I'll be responsible for all the work, and he's only funding the business.</p>

<p>My question is, who pays the company expenses? Is it split 50/50 between us or is it all on him?</p>

<p>The profits are shared 50/50.</p>

<p>It depends on your agreement. If the company is making money or the investing partner has contributed cash, it should be used to pay for expenses before asking for additional cash. </p>

<p>That definitely needs to be a question answered in your agreement, though. </p>

<p>Whatever you decide, do it in advance and make sure it is clear. A great book I would recommend on the subject is called Slicing Pie -

<p>Regarding equity, the take home message is that rather than deciding on who gets what amount of equity before starting a business, it should be done during the growth of the business as that allows you to adjust things in real-time keep it as fair as possible. It feels 'obvious' after you consider the concept but it still opened up my thinking.</p>

<p>Regarding expenses and money/sweat equity, his model (summarised) is:
1. Cash is king - so if you contribute cash (vs time/sth else) - the cash has a ‘multiplier effect’ on how many ‘equity points’ you get (he recommends 4x)
2. Determine an hourly contribution rate for each person. So if partner x puts in 20 hours and partner y puts in 10 hours, they both get the appropriate amount of ‘equity points'.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
