<p>I own a WY LLC as a sole member. I want to add my spouse as a second managing member, and I understand I must amend the LLC's operating agreement in order to do it.</p>

<p>As this is the first time I'm amending an LLC's operating agreement, would anyone be able to point me to a straightforward template I could use?</p>

<p>Many thanks.</p>

<p>I really doubt it is necessary to amend your current LLC operating agreement as I said in my comment. However, if you really want a new Operating Agreement, I have provided links to various sample downloads and templates.</p>

<p>If you choose a totally new agreement, be sure to title it "Amended and Restated" and then use an "as of" date. You also need to retain your current agreement, because that is governing agreement on how operations were done during the period prior to the Amended and Restated Agreement.</p>

<p>The agreements are of various quality. Rather than using one single document, I would cut and paste an agreement that has all the items you wish to include. Then, revise the cut &amp; paste document so it flows and makes sense. And next compare your agreement to the most detailed sample to make sure you didn't leave something important to you out. Then finally compare it to a simple example to insure you have all the required items in your agreement.</p>

<p>Note all the agreements say their document does not constitute legal advice.</p>
