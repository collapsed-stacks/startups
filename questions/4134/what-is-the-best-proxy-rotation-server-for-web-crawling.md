My startup company is doing a web crawling to get **about 20Gb data per day**. And like all other web crawling, we're facing the banned IP problem in one day and the bandwidth using :).
So, what is the best proxy rotation server I can buy ? How about [ProxyMesh][1] or [5socks.net][2] ?
I can only pay 30$-50$ per month for proxy server service!

Please help me, a poor entrepreneur :D
Thank in advance !
