<p>My startup company is doing a web crawling to get <strong>about 20Gb data per day</strong>. And like all other web crawling, we're facing the banned IP problem in one day and the bandwidth using :).
So, what is the best proxy rotation server I can buy ? How about <a href="https://proxymesh.com/" rel="nofollow">ProxyMesh</a> or <a href="https://5socks.net" rel="nofollow">5socks.net</a> ?
I can only pay 30$-50$ per month for proxy server service!</p>

<p>Please help me, a poor entrepreneur :D
Thank in advance !</p>
