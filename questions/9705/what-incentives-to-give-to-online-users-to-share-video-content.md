<p>I am running a startup website for online users to share video content on my website , and I am not sure what incentives should I give them? I do not want to give them money, so what incentives can make users record videos and share it on my website?</p>

<p>Gamification is one way. And seeing as you're asking on stackexchange, the whole reputation and badges process gamifies interaction and participation.</p>

<p>So you can try</p>

<ol>
<li>Leaderboards #number of videos uploaded.</li>
<li>Badges #number of days/weeks streak of consecutive uploads</li>
</ol>

<p>Contests are another good way to incentivise uploads.</p>

<ol>
<li>Thematic contests e.g. cat videos</li>
<li>Featured item videos e.g. "Wild Strawberries" - see Tropfest items</li>
<li>Target demographic - e.g. school students or film school students</li>
</ol>

<p>Inspiration and challenges</p>

<ol>
<li>Finish the sentence "My grandmother taught me..."</li>
<li>Shoot the sunrise from your house.</li>
<li>Give them a shotlist and they submit their movie.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is all assuming the videos you want are some sort of creative process. If you want Minecraft game-play videos I can't think of anything.</p>
