I am running a startup website for online users to share video content on my website , and I am not sure what incentives should I give them? I do not want to give them money, so what incentives can make users record videos and share it on my website?

Gamification is one way. And seeing as you're asking on stackexchange, the whole reputation and badges process gamifies interaction and participation.

So you can try

 1. Leaderboards #number of videos uploaded.
 2. Badges #number of days/weeks streak of consecutive uploads

Contests are another good way to incentivise uploads.

 1. Thematic contests e.g. cat videos
 2. Featured item videos e.g. "Wild Strawberries" - see Tropfest items
 3. Target demographic - e.g. school students or film school students

Inspiration and challenges

 1. Finish the sentence "My grandmother taught me..."
 2. Shoot the sunrise from your house.
 3. Give them a shotlist and they submit their movie.

This is all assuming the videos you want are some sort of creative process. If you want Minecraft game-play videos I can't think of anything.

Make them feel like they are part of a **community**.
