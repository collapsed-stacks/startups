<p>I need advice. 
I think it's better to ask here this question. I started own hosting and named it "XEOVO" <a href="https://www.xeovo.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.xeovo.com</a> </p>

<p>What do you think about this brand name? Is it okay? I really need to get feedback, because in the Russian language you can distort brand name. 
Does it sound okay in English? Easy to remember and pronounce? </p>

<p>We have a chance now to change the name because we are changing website/panel and billing system.</p>

<p>In my opinion XEOVO is hard to remember or pronounce in English.. Only thing I can associate it with is VEVO, and most name recognition is usually tied to associating it with something you already know.</p>

<p>But any name can become a comfortable and known thing when you're big, just a lot harder to get to that stage.</p>

<p>You do have the shortness of the name going for you, but when you have the possibility to rebrand, it's worth to take a further look into this and do some feedback test groups to come up with something great.</p>

<p>There are quite a few online focus group platforms that can help, where you can get a lot of people to pitch in for fairly low costs and in desired regions and interest groups. However I have not used any and don't feel comfortable recommending one for this very reason.</p>

<p>Google: online focus group (or groups) for further information about them and maybe you can later pitch in with your findings regarding the platforms and results.</p>

<p>Just my 2 cents :)</p>

<p>I don't see any issue with your chosen name.  Pronunciation may be a challenge, but is not insurmountable. You could even use that as a "thing" in your advertising, along the lines of "you say potato..." .  You own the .com domain, which is honestly one of the most important factors for an entirely online business.  </p>

<p>It is unique and short enough to be memorable and abstract enough to not carry any preconceived notions.  I doubt any benefits you could derive from rebranding would be offset the cost (both direct and indirect) of such a rebranding effort at this point as there is nothing fundamentally wrong with your name.</p>

<p>I really think you hit on a great name for your organization.</p>
