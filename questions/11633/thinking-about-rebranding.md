I need advice. 
I think it's better to ask here this question. I started own hosting and named it "XEOVO" https://www.xeovo.com 

What do you think about this brand name? Is it okay? I really need to get feedback, because in the Russian language you can distort brand name. 
Does it sound okay in English? Easy to remember and pronounce? 

We have a chance now to change the name because we are changing website/panel and billing system.

In my opinion XEOVO is hard to remember or pronounce in English.. Only thing I can associate it with is VEVO, and most name recognition is usually tied to associating it with something you already know.

But any name can become a comfortable and known thing when you're big, just a lot harder to get to that stage.

You do have the shortness of the name going for you, but when you have the possibility to rebrand, it's worth to take a further look into this and do some feedback test groups to come up with something great.

There are quite a few online focus group platforms that can help, where you can get a lot of people to pitch in for fairly low costs and in desired regions and interest groups. However I have not used any and don't feel comfortable recommending one for this very reason.

Google: online focus group (or groups) for further information about them and maybe you can later pitch in with your findings regarding the platforms and results.

Just my 2 cents :)

I don't see any issue with your chosen name.  Pronunciation may be a challenge, but is not insurmountable. You could even use that as a "thing" in your advertising, along the lines of "you say potato..." .  You own the .com domain, which is honestly one of the most important factors for an entirely online business.  

It is unique and short enough to be memorable and abstract enough to not carry any preconceived notions.  I doubt any benefits you could derive from rebranding would be offset the cost (both direct and indirect) of such a rebranding effort at this point as there is nothing fundamentally wrong with your name.

I really think you hit on a great name for your organization.
