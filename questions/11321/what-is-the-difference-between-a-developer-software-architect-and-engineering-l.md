<p>I was asked recently which job I wanted to apply for job: </p>

<ul>
<li>developer</li>
<li>software architect</li>
<li>engineering lead</li>
</ul>

<p>Most people -- outside of startups -- thought these were all the same role.  Then I asked within startups and got mixed messages.</p>

<ul>
<li>a developer obviously programs </li>
<li>engineerin lead is "a lead engineer is a lot like being Captain Kirk of the U.S.S. Enterprise" </li>
<li>A software architect is a software expert who makes high-level design choices and dictates technical standards, including software coding standards, tools, and platforms. </li>
</ul>

<p>These roles all kind of overlap in various ways and recruiters, marketers or people outside the programming space often ask me to pick just one.  </p>

<p>Any ideas for what the distinctions might be?</p>

<p>In my own experience it usually goes something like this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Developer</strong> is the rank and file. They can be junior or senior or what have you, it doesn't matter. What counts is that they'll be doing the day to day execution.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lead Developer</strong> usually is a senior developer in charge of leading a team of developers. That often means they'll be throwing grunt work at a few juniors and providing guidance to the latter. Depending on the lead dev and their team they'll either stick to project managing the whole thing, or assign a hard task or three to themselves while the others team members work on the more mundane tasks (or on tasks they're specialized in).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Software Architect</strong> is a very senior dev who gets involved in high level software design-related questions. They vet architectural choices made by others, tackle some of architectural design themselves, and offer guidance as to how long this or that will take for the developers.</p></li>
</ul>
