<p>ZenPayroll handles most of the pain of payroll-related taxes for us, and that's great.  What are some good ways to efficiently handle corporate income tax, i.e. Form 1120?  We'd love to focus on building product.</p>

<p>Find an accountant or a small accounting firm near you, and have them take care of this for you. Make sure they put their money where their mouth is: if a taxman audits you, they should be the ones taking care of it.</p>

<p>Don't bother checking with Deloitte, E&amp;Y, PWC, or KPMG. They're into account auditing and certification for publicly traded companies. And they price accordingly -- as in scratch your eyes out expensive. You might eventually work with them later on when you head for an IPO. Just not now.</p>

<p>Just hire a firm to do it for you.
I don't know how large your company is but check in with Deloitte, Ernst &amp; Young, PriceWaterhouseCoopers, and KMPG. They'll do that stuff.</p>
