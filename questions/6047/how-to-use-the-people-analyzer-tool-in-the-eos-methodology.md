Anyone familiar with the EOS business methodology? I'm interested specifically in the [People Analyzer Tool](http://eosworldwide.com/people/).
I'm not entirely sure how to use the tool correctly, especially the last 3 columns (gets it, wants it, capacity) and their meaning.

You can learn more about these tools by reading Traction (by Gino Wickman) and Get A Grip (by Wickman and Mike Paton). 

Briefly - the People Analyzer helps leaders and managers assess and communicate with employees as to whether or not they are "Right People" (who share the company's Core Values) in the "Right Seat" (who are consistently good at their jobs). "GWC" stands for "Get It" (someone who is genetically encoded to do this particular kind of work well) "Want It" (someone who springs out of bed every day wanting to excel in their job) and "Capacity to Do It," (someone who has the education, training, experience, maturity to consistently perform the job at a high level). 

Hope that helps.
