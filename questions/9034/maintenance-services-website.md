You have to set pre-defined prices for their services, when booked through your site, if you are expecting a brokerage amount. 

Else, there is no way you can learn how much they earned. Even if they tell you how much they earned, there is a very high probability of lying, as they need to pay a certain %age from the amount as your brokerage.

It is also good to have pre-defined prices on your site to curb overcharging by the technicians, thus affecting customer satisfaction and trust.
