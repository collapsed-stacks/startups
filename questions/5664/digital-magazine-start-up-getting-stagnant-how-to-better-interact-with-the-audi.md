<p>I started an online digital magazine with a group of friends. This is the link to it <a href="http://www.musemalady.com/" rel="nofollow">musemalady.com</a>. When we started this company it went off really well getting appreciable attention on social media, but now it seems to have become stagnant. </p>

<p>Now though we have better content, higher frequency of publishing article, and more visual content, still our viewer count is not increasing. How can I better interact with the audience and promote the site.</p>

<p>Are you promoting your site's content at all? If you're not submitting to social networks like Twitter, Reddit, etc., guest blogging every here and there, doing press releases every here and there, and what have you, you're not. Some ideas to promote your content:</p>

<p>Also, your site isn't loading, or maybe it is but it's doing so too slowly. That's a big no no insofar as SEO is concerned, because you'll get a severe penalty from Google.</p>
