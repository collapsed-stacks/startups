## When you've handed over an idea, how long before you can take it back?

<p>I generally try and keep some good ideas to hand, where "good" means:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Compact - simply expressed, with a relatively small amount of work to v1</p></li>
<li><p>Testable - a clear way to turn time or/and money into customer development and hypothesis falsification</p></li>
<li><p>Valuable - either (a) a clear correspondence between problem and a proxy for cost; or (b) a way of retaining the attention of a community; (c) an existing business or relational model where money flows but which would benefit from rewiring</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Partly this is just fun, and partly it's because if someone comes to me with a terrible idea but not the experience to understand why it's bad, or a potentially great idea that is just way too big a step from where they are, then I'll cheerfully lob across an idea that they can play with, learn from and then, usually discard.</p>

<p>I have a problem that one such idea I gave to someone I'm no longer in contact with, and that would be ideal for someone else I'm mentoring. It's over a year now, and I see no evidence that they've taken it forward, but they're so far off my radar that it's 1% possible that they're running with it in stealth.</p>

<p>From a pure rights and wrongs point of view, I'm clear that ideas (even "good" ones), have no value, that they aren't property, and that in startups it's often the case, and a good thing too, that you may have multiple projects in very much the same space.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I feel hesitant.</p>

<p>What's my next move? Do I go with my reason and offer the (recycled) idea that I think would be most helpful, or listen to my gut that says that unless I know my former contact has set it aside, I shouldn't draw anyone else's attention to the same opportunity?</p>

<p>Unless you've promised the first party to never share the same idea with anyone else, then you're under no moral obligation not to.</p>

<p>From a practical perspective, you clearly have no ongoing interest in the first party, financial or otherwise. And even if you assume they are developing in stealth mode, if it's a good business, then it's only a matter of time before they'd have some other competitor pop up.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it seems like the best thing you could for your current padawan is to give him the idea.</p>
