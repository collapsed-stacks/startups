I am looking for resources, knowledge, or strategies on how to re-engage past users or customers. This is for a software as a service company. The less expensive, the better as this is for a startup

Forget past customers for a moment, and ask yourself why anyone would be interested in doing business with you.

The same rules apply.

Seeking a new customer is a challenge.
Seeking business with an old customer is an opportunity.

How? The one difference you have with a past customer (compared to a new customer) is you already have names and numbers, and possibly, hopefully, have a legacy of not being horrible.

If you have a product or service that interests any prospective customer, find the selling points, and push them.

Know your product - if possible, make them an attractive offer (first three months free (but make clear on what that includes/excludes to avoid misunderstanding), send them some samples... failing that, re-approach, tell them you are a startup, and you would appreciate constructive criticism on your product/service - you not care if they buy or not, but you would appreciate it if you could meet for lunch and a chat with them. Your honesty and friendly approach might win you a trial, or a referral. You got nothing to lose, all to gain.

Respect your customer... Think carefully, why would they want to take money from their pocket, and put it in to yours.

Best of luck!
