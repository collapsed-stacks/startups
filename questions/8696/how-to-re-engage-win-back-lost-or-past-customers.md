<p>I am looking for resources, knowledge, or strategies on how to re-engage past users or customers. This is for a software as a service company. The less expensive, the better as this is for a startup</p>

<p>Forget past customers for a moment, and ask yourself why anyone would be interested in doing business with you.</p>

<p>The same rules apply.</p>

<p>Seeking a new customer is a challenge.
Seeking business with an old customer is an opportunity.</p>

<p>How? The one difference you have with a past customer (compared to a new customer) is you already have names and numbers, and possibly, hopefully, have a legacy of not being horrible.</p>

<p>If you have a product or service that interests any prospective customer, find the selling points, and push them.</p>

<p>Know your product - if possible, make them an attractive offer (first three months free (but make clear on what that includes/excludes to avoid misunderstanding), send them some samples... failing that, re-approach, tell them you are a startup, and you would appreciate constructive criticism on your product/service - you not care if they buy or not, but you would appreciate it if you could meet for lunch and a chat with them. Your honesty and friendly approach might win you a trial, or a referral. You got nothing to lose, all to gain.</p>

<p>Respect your customer... Think carefully, why would they want to take money from their pocket, and put it in to yours.</p>

<p>Best of luck!</p>
