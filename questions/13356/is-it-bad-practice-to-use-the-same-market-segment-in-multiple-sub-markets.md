## Is it bad practice to use the same Market Segment, in multiple Sub-Markets?

I am currently working on a venture, within the Art Market.  One of the Sub Markets is 'Canvas Prints'.  

As part of the Segmentation process, I have put together several broad Market Segments for assessment, such as 'Animal Lovers' and 'Sports Fans'.  

There are other Sub Markets, such as 'Sculptures' and 'T Shirts' where 'Animals Lovers' and 'Sports Fans' could also fit in.  Is this a plausible approach to Market Segmentation, or should I find a workaround for not having the same Market Segment, under multiple Sub Markets?
