<p>I am currently in a position where the company that hired me (temporary) wants something I developed. I haven't started working for them yet and it is something I developed a while back. </p>

<p>Now is there any way I can negotiate a sale of this thing or even lease on a license? Also there's a possibility that I might be asked to redo everything on the job and so a sale might not be possible. </p>

<p>Would like some help/opinion on this.</p>

<p>I hate to say this but your <strong>best bet to get a good deal on that, would have been during your interview/recruting phase with the company</strong>. So before you signed the contract. You could have asked for equity or a bonus/purchasing price of the previouse work. Since you have done stuff before which will then be used by the company. If you have signed a contract of for a fix amount of time, were you are hired as a developer. The company can just say: repeat what you have developed. And if your notice period is to long you will be forced to develop what they want. So You could have negotiated a greater salery or a bonus or equity but now that you signed a working contract pretty much everything is done.</p>

<p>Try to talk to them they might be nice guys and you can find a solution together. It seems that you want to work for/with them but you had second thoughts about your negotiation and you are not sure if you sould have negotiated harder.</p>
