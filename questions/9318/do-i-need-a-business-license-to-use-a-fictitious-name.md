 I am not interested at this time in starting a business. My health is too poor. What I am doing is writing open source software to keep my skills up and would like to release it under a fictitious name.

Do I need to do anything so the software copyright is assigned to that name? At some point I hope to roll the software into a business.

I am in the US, more specifically Washington state.

Thanks

<p>The answer to your question is that you can operate your business as a "dba", meaning "doing business as".  So, for example, Sam Smith could be "doing business as" Sam's Software.  This is also called a "sole proprietorship", and it requires no licensing other than a sales tax permit, if Washington requires one.  </p>

<p>As for copyrights, you can always put the copyright in the name of your fictitious "dba", whatever that is.  Obtaining a copyright is pretty simple and straightforward.  Go to <a href="http://www.copyright.gov" rel="nofollow">www.copyright.gov</a></p>

<p>to study more on it, but it's simple.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
