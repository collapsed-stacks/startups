Being a B2B company and providing mobile software to a niche market in the logistics, and each of our customers usually buying between 15 to 150 units, is it the best approach to disclose our prices on the web site?

Assuming that you don't sell your product online, I think that A/B testing can be a good solution, or at least help you find the best solution. 

Showing prices or not showing prices can affect sales dramatically. Therefore you don't want to speculate with it. You can easly A/B test it by using 2 versions of your website with 2 different phone numbers.

I think that most companies in your situation decide not to show prices for various reasons but testing it and getting real numbers is the best way to know.

It entirely depends on how your lead generation efforts and sales process are set up, and to some extent on how expensive your product or service is.

If you're set up to take orders online, then obviously yes -- it should be on the site somewhere.

If you're using your site to qualify leads and steer them into asking more information from your sales staff, then the case for showing your prices online is a lot less clear.

The main benefit of disclosing some pricing information online without taking orders is that it can allow you to qualify leads before they even bother trying to contact you.

Let's take the example of a custom app development shop. It could write something like:

> Get in touch to discuss your project. (Please note: our minimum project size is $25k.)

See how that tiny bit of information might turn off anyone who was looking for a cheap code grunt?

Note, however, that you'd still have no idea of how much your project would cost.

This brings us to the main problem with disclosing precise pricing information upfront or too early: doing so can backlash when the benefits of doing business with you are not clearcut enough yet.

Once the prospect is made keenly aware of the upside they'll get, and convinced that you'll deliver, they'll approach any prices you toss at them with positive ROI in mind. Do so before that, and they'll perceive intolerably high risk -- either the upside is unclear, or your ability to deliver is unclear.

I would add to Denis' answer about competitors.  Do you have any direct competitors and do they have transparent pricing on their site?  If they do then you want to follow suit, otherwise I'd say no.  Now I'd only say no/maybe if you had an obviously better product and can demonstrate that on your site.

Well, Totally depends on what your marketing strategy is usually companies tend to show their prices on their websites in order to let the customer choose as to which product he is interested in. It is also a good strategy to not show the prices since B2B usually have large scaled deals in which prices see a constant ups & downs.
