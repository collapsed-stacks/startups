<p>In India, there are a lot of ways to come across/find a potential co-founder. </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Facebook:</strong> Many people under-estimate facebook as a potential productivity tool. But, there are several startup groups on facebook, where serious startup discussions and recruiting happens. I have met my co-founder on a similar group(<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/delhistartups/" rel="nofollow">Delhi Startups</a>), and  have successfully founded a company and recently raised funding too. So, the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/blrstartups/" rel="nofollow">Bangalore startups</a> group would be the one you would want to use. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/blrstartups.connect/" rel="nofollow">Another Bangalore startups group</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Meetups:</strong> There are several startup meetups happening in Bangalore. And potential co-founders and employees can be met during those meetups, especially during the networking phase.</li>
<li><strong>Angelist:</strong> It is another wonderful site, where you can connect with potential partners, discuss your ideas with them, and create your startup profile, and even apply for a funding at a later stage.</li>
</ul>

Well I'd suggest firstly establishing what kind people and what positions are integral for your start up. 
Freelancers is a good alternative for filling up positions. Its an means to an end.
I used the site http://www.upworks.com
to find a temporary freelancer. But you can find people there willing to become a part of your team. 
Downside: it's not free. 

Other alternatives are incubators. You can find many likeminded people there.

An example I found with a quick Google search is:

Try searching around for other incubators. I guess you'd find quite a few

<p><a href="http://veloztechform.com/blog/7-ways-to-select-your-team-for-startup/" rel="nofollow">Choosing the right startup team</a> should be at the top of your list. Having the right team determines the path and outcome of a new venture.</p>

<p>Here are the key points that you need to keep in mind when forming your startup dream team :</p>

<p><strong>Common Passion</strong>: It is important that every member of your team identifies your passion and becomes equally passionate about it.</p>

<p><strong>Go-Getter</strong>: A go-getter is an informal term generally used for a person who is aggressively enterprising. Every member should be able to give his 100% to his area of expertise and make sure that he compensates for the lack of manpower.</p>

<p><strong>Ability to Work as a Team</strong>: It is very important for the team members of a startup to be able to work with each other. If all the members of the team cannot work together as a team, the going will only get tough.
The Right Mix : You would need all kinds of people to make an idea work. You need to have the right mix of expertise including marketer, manager, leader and industry veteran in your team so that the idea actually sees the light of the day.</p>

<p><strong>No Place for Egos</strong>: There is no room for personal egos in a small startup team. Just as you cannot work with a team where people have strong individual egos, they too will not be able to work if you have a stubborn ego. Everyone should have the right to voice his/her opinion, should agree to disagree and yet should continue to work as a team.</p>

<p><strong>Be Prepared for Failures</strong> : Very few businesses can boast of having a smooth ride all the way to success. Initial failures are a part of the deal and each member of your team must be up for it. If any member stumbles at the very beginning and decides to quit, you must be able to motivate and retain the person.</p>

<p><strong>Long-term Commitment</strong>: You should build a team that is committed to the company for a long time. When hiring members for your core team, you come across a personâ€™s CV that reflects that he often changes his job, you should be wary of recruiting the person.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, you must have a team that is able to complement each other and cushion weaknesses. Everyone cannot be the decision-maker but everyone should have a democratic right to voice their opinions. You should be working with a team that is able to see and literally live your dream.</p>

<p>Hope it will help you to build strong startup team!</p>
