I have an idea of a meeting game/chat service - I know this market is overcrowded, but I think I invented something unique and interesting for people. So my question is, what prototype would be enough for such idea?

The goal here is to get feedback from users and seed funding from investors or via crowdfunding.

If I create a chat simulator (with prompt answers and questions) just to show the logic & rules of this game, plus several screens like user profile and registration - will that be ok?

I obviously can't create the whole system on the initial stage. 

What's your opinion, guys?

The idea and sketches will only take you so far. In order to raise money from real investors, you need a working prototype or proof of concept model, which you can show the investors that works.

This is because the investor needs to know that you and your team can actual accomplish and execute. Pictures, diagrams and idea presentation do not give the slightest clue to an investor if you can really bring your idea to life. (The best way to get an answer for such a question is always put yourself in the investor shoes for example, and ask your self the same question, in this case: "Would I give money to someone only based on an idea and drawings without actually knowing what they can do?)

There's always the FFF (friend, family & fools) category for early seed money which could easily be scored by being an amazing person, having an amazing idea, or by confusing someone with a lot of excess money, and doesn't really require proof just yet.

Like to everything there's also a rule to this. Investors may give you money, requiring less proof, when you have a successful exit in your past.

Taking all of this into consideration I recommend you to find a co-founder, set up an equity scheme to avoid future conflicts and build a prototype (even over weekends if it doesn't work out any other way) Then based on a working prototype you can already create a company and start pitching to investors.

Good luck and have fun!
