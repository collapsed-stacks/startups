*I'm posting this in startups, because my end goal is to start something on my own.*

I've been living off online poker for the past 5 years. I decided to quit poker and pursue something more fulfilling. So, last year I enrolled in a web design (community college) program with the plan to transfer to university after 1 year and study CS. Now I'm unsure if I want to be spending the next 4 years of my life in university, because by the time I graduate I'll be 32yo. Although, without a CS degree I'll have less leverage over my employers, and my options are going to be limited if I later decide to work outside of web design.
So here are my options:

- Build a portfolio and try to get an internship in front end, JS, or UX design.

- Complete 1 more year of community college, then intern.

- Start 4 year CS degree studies. I'm approved for grant money that would cover 2/3 of the costs.

- Continue learning on my own and build things. I have money saved up that I can live off of for 2 years.

Note: I have NO work experience, as I've been living off online poker for a long time. I'm interested in so many things (front end, back end, UX/UI), but the end goal would be to start my own thing or work remotely once I gain experience in the field. I've wanted to study CS for a long time now, because many areas of it interest me, but 4 years is a long time for someone who's starting at 28 years old.

<p>Before giving my answer I would like to be upfront about the fact that I myself have attained an associates degree and a bachelors degree. And actually happen to be a poker player, but that's another story...</p>

<hr>

<p>First off, this will not be one of those brain dead answers saying "can't get a good job without a degree", that mindset may have been true a while ago but nothing is ever that black and white.</p>

<hr>

<p>University</p>

<p>A degree will be helpful for getting you in the door and will teach you the fundamentals of CS. I do not regret doing my degree because it opened up my opportunities across borders. However, if you think that a bunch of computer science profs (who in my experience, haven't been in the real world in years) are going to prepare you to be useful in the real world, then I'm sorry to burst your bubble. When I came out I found that while I had the fundamentals I really didn't have any useful skills used in industry today (new languages, frameworks etc)</p>

<p>Please keep in mind that this may not be true about the top tier schools (MIT etc.) as I would not know.</p>

<hr>

<p>College</p>

<p>While I got hands on experience the college didn't do much to help me find good work.</p>

<hr>

<p>Self-learning</p>

<p>This is how I learned almost every useful skill I have. Through the determination to get up and do a 20 hour course and then move on to the next one.</p>

<p>For this I would recommend sites like...</p>

<ul>
<li>Lynda.com (for the fundamentals)</li>
<li>Udemy</li>
<li><a href="http://www.pluralsight.com" rel="nofollow">Pluralsight</a></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>Your missing option: Developer bootcamps</p>

<p>This is the one option that you have overlooked. Developer bootcamps (at least the reputable one) can get you job ready in a few months if you are willing to put your life on hold and live, sleep, breath code.</p>

<p>I know people who have done them and have good things to say and now have great jobs.</p>

<p>Check out...</p>

<p>Full Stack Academy
Hack Reactor</p>

<p>Many of them also have options for remote programs. Make sure you do your research though.</p>

<hr>

<p>What do I recommend?</p>

<p>Well from the above it probably sounds like I am advising to teach yourself everything but this may not be your best option.</p>

<p>I think that I was able to teach myself so much for 2 reasons...</p>

<ol>
<li>I spent time learning the fundamentals and was able to build on that knowledge.</li>
<li>After doing years of school I knew how to learn on my own, and so the more courses I did on my own the better I got at learning from them.</li>
</ol>

<p>CS can be a very hard subject to learn on your own.</p>

<p>If you feel that you need guidance then your   good options are...</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A 4 year CS degree and large levels of self learning</p></li>
<li><p>A 4 month intense bootcamp and lots of self learning.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If I was in your decision I would first reach out and try to get someone to help you build a lesson plan for 2 months. Then try to tackle it yourself and try to find a mentor.</p>

<p>Then, if you are struggling then look for some guided help.</p>

The best way to learn about building a technology company could be to start a Computer Science degree. While you are enrolled into the program, you will get a chance to meet like minded people. If you are enrolled into a University that promotes entrepreneurship, you will have access to mentors and probably investors.

Another interesting thing is while you complete your degree, you will probably do multiple internships which will help you understand how companies work.

There aren't always jobs for people without a degree (the opposite isn't true either). If you want to start your own company, you will need a certain degree of financial independence which is the ability to take a year off from your job and pursue entrepreneurship. If I were you my strategy would have been to complete a degree, get a job and work for a great company for 2 years and save 50% of my monthly expense every month. After two years I will have 1 years expenses saved. This could be a great time to go and start my own company. If the company succeeds, well and good. On the other hand if the company fails, I will go get another job.

Good luck!

Actually, you will be 34 years old by the time you finish your MBA.

You cannot get a six-figures job in this day and age with only a college education.

Today, the life expectancy of an individual currently living in the United States of America is 78.

However, new drugs are being discovered daily and some of them can cure you from a lot of incurable diseases.

At the very least, you can live longer.

Also, there are many technological advances now helping you to live longer, my mother has a titanium hip. This was not possible 50 years ago.

You can now buy a Mitsubhishi heart and replace your current heart with an artificial heart. Again, this was not possible 50 years ago.

As you can see, you may live all way to 88 years old in the near future.

You can live in the ghetto or you can live in Bel Air.

Choose wisely.
