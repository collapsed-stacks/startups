<p>I'm looking in developing a very specific piece of software and need to outsource it. The software is purely for internal use, it will include basic  CRM, but also functionality relating to inputting customer orders and outputting workshop instructions. You can say it's a retail / medical market.</p>

<p>I know about sites like Freelancer and Upwork, but I don't think they are the right match since</p>

<p>a) I don't want  to wade through dozens of lone ranger</p>

<p>b) I don't want to start with the price, but rather I want to provide the problem and get a full proposal and quote from interested and relevant contractors.</p>

<p>I've tried Googling "offshore developers" and "outsourcing developers", but there again way too many.</p>

<p>Where would I start?</p>

<p>Thanks in advanced.</p>

<p>There are quite a few companies that do this kind of work, and the below is no way an exhaustive list, it's just the ones I know of.</p>

<p>I suggest you check out each and search for similar companies.</p>

<p>The benefit of working with them is that you'll get a team of people working on your project,rather than just one freelancer. <a href="https://www.textacoder.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer">TextaCoder</a>, <a href="https://gigster.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Gigster</a>, <a href="https://codegophers.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">CodeGophers</a> work this way.</p>

<p>There are also companies who offer a flat fee and time frame for each project completion:</p>

<p>5 Days 5K: <a href="https://airdev.co/sprint/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Airdev</a></p>

<p>10 Days 10K: <a href="https://www.tenrocket.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">TenRocket</a></p>

<p>1MO 18K: <a href="https://tillerlabs.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer">TillerLabs</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.koder.tech/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Koder</a> does something different by offering "developers as a service".  For a monthly subscription you have an X amount of developer man hours at your disposal.</p>

<p>Also check out <a href="https://blitz.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Blitz</a>, created by Udacity, if you are interested in hiring the developers after project completion.</p>
