<p>Soon i will be launching a new Application available for Mobile, Tablet and Desktop and I am searching for a way to promote it through different channels.</p>

<p>I am thinking of finding people that will bring new subscription and then give them shares proportionally to the number of subscription they bring...</p>

<p>What do you think about this method? What other methods do you suggest?</p>

<p>The app will be a Facebook App, Users will be able to login and invite facebook friends, I also will give users benefits for inviting friends on Facebook</p>

<hr>

<p>Edit: I'm throwing in a bounty to spice things up.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>All promotional channels need to be <strong>free</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Give the <strong>maximum amount</strong> of <strong>online resources</strong> that we can use, so that the post will be useful for the community</p></li>
<li><p>Include important info if you know them for example:</p>

<ul>
<li>is it totally free? or it has also some for pay services? </li>
<li>does it have a meritocratic system</li>
<li>does it have an excessive number of startups being promoted</li>
<li>does the promotional channel reach real customers or just other startups/developer</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Based on your practical Startup Experience which websites gave you the maximum success</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I will award my bounty to those that give the most complete answer, that will be the most useful to the community</p>

<p>Thanks
Best Regards

<p>This is a fairly broad question without know more about your app, but here is a basic list of distribution strategies you can use for most products:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Word of Mouth</strong>. Find your first few customers through personal connections. Do an amazing job for them and they will refer you to their friends, who in turn will refer you to their friends, and so on. Encourage this through a referral program (e.g., you get 10% off your offer for referring a friend and your friend gets a 10% discount too) or a revenue sharing program (e.g., your idea of users being able to make money from attracting new users to your app).</li>
<li><strong>Advertising</strong>. Advertise your business on Google, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, etc.</li>
<li><strong>PR, Media, Blogs</strong>. Build a relationship with bloggers, journalists, and other media people and get them to write an article about your company. Submit your app to as many publications and aggregators as you can. For example, you could use <a href="http://www.promotehour.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Promotehour</a> to find a list of places to submit your startup and <a href="https://justreachout.io/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">JustReachOut</a> to find journalists on any topic.</li>
<li><strong>Inbound Marketing</strong>. Create content around your app, such as blog posts, talks, open source code, etc. The goal is to <em>teach</em> your audience, for free. Once they start seeing you as an expert in some domain, they will be more likely to use your products.</li>
<li><strong>SEO</strong>. Create lots of content (see inbound marketing above) that ranks highly in search engines. </li>
<li><strong>Social Media</strong>. Share the content you create (see inbound marketing above) on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Google Plus, etc. Build a following.</li>
<li><strong>Communities</strong>. Search Meetup for local meetups. Search Lanyrd for conferences. Search Reddit, Hacker News, Quora, and Stack Exchange for online communities. Get involved and help/teach the communities (don't just spam them).</li>
</ol>

<p>In business terms, what you're looking for are the beta customers for your app. They can be acquired in the following ways:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Personal network and referrals</strong>: Ask people in your immediate personal networks to try the app, and also refer it to more people. It is one of the most effective ways of customer acquisition.</li>
<li><strong>Communities/meetups in the domain</strong>: Attend meetups/community events in the domain of your app, and pitch your app to the attendees. This would both help you further build your network, as well as marketing and outreach for your app release.</li>
<li>Finally, here are some online websites, which you can post in, regarding your app and get beta customers: <a href="https://github.com/mmccaff/PlacesToPostYourStartup" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://github.com/mmccaff/PlacesToPostYourStartup</a></li>
</ol>

<p>I have personally tries the third way, via Reddit, and can vouch for the fact that it works, and also that the beta customers acquired through this channel actually give candid feedback, which further help in the future iterations of your app release.</p>
