<p>I'm looking into the pricing and availability of insurance against claims that can be brought against a marketplace (think TaskRabbit, UrbanSitter, etc) for crimes and errors committed by the service providers against their clients (members of the public, registered on site). </p>

<p>What are the terms and things to start my research from? Any experts to reach out to for consultation? </p>

<p>Target Market: US. </p>
