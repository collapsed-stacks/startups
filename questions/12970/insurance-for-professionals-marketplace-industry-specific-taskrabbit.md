I'm looking into the pricing and availability of insurance against claims that can be brought against a marketplace (think TaskRabbit, UrbanSitter, etc) for crimes and errors committed by the service providers against their clients (members of the public, registered on site). 

What are the terms and things to start my research from? Any experts to reach out to for consultation? 

Target Market: US.
