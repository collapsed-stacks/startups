Is it possible to register an LLC business name under US laws, with the term GROUP in it, while the business is a one person company?

Say something like: The blabla Group L.L.C.

(If it matters, the business is to be registered in the Maryland state).

Thanks.

<p>I'm not a lawyer, but I don't believe there are any laws against this. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.dat.state.md.us/sdatweb/artorgan.pdf" rel="nofollow">Maryland Articles of Organization for a Limited Liability Company</a> include these rules for the name.</p>

<pre><code>The name must not be misleadingly similar to that of another LLC, Corporation,
Trade Name, Limited Partnership or Limited Liability Partnership on file with the Department and the name
of the LLC must include one of the following:
a. Limited Liability Company
b. L.L.C.
c. LLC
d. L.C.
e. L C 
</code></pre>

<p>According to those requirements, assuming "The blabla Group L.L.C." or a similar name hasn't been taken, you should be able to register under that name.</p>

I am an attorney in California, but your question falls under Federal law. 

Yes - you can register a business name that includes the word "GROUP" even if you are currently operating as an individual.  However, merely registering an LLC does not protect your business name against competitors who might use the same name.  It is a better idea to register a trademark at the USPTO (uspto.gov).  

Hiring an attorney to prosecute a trademark is generally the best way to go.  Trademark prosecution is usually under $1,500 plus $350 for the government fees.  It might sound like a lot of money, but a trademark (if properly maintained) can last forever.  For example, "Coca Cola."
