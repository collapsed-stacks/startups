We are a small startup company with a SaaS solution, I wonder if there is any place (website) where startups can exchange services between each other?

Thank you!

<p>Yes, there are several.</p>

<p>The act of exchange (goods or services) for other goods or services without using money, is called BARTERING.</p>

<p>In your case, one of the best bartering websites would be <a href="http://www.bizx.com/" rel="nofollow">BizX</a></p>

<p>BizX is for business-to-business barter, where members use “BizX dollars” to help each other save cash on expenses and find new ways to grow their businesses. </p>

<p>BizX dollars are earned by (and can be spent on) selling products, services, or unused inventory to other members.</p>
