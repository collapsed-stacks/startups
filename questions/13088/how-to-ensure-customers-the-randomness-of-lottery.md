I hear that people around me express their concerns about validity of lotteries.
They usually don't participate, because they think that holders would cheat and give the prize to a friend/relative.

I'm trying to run small lotteries to grab more customers, yet I need to prove somehow that they are 100% valid and are not biased or can not be cheated.
Is there a way to ensure people about the validity of a given lottery?

Edit:
I'm talking about some kind of algorithm for this. With no need to a supervision entity. Lottery or prize or anything else, that is based on randomness. You see a guy winning on TV. How do you get sure that he's not the son of the holder? Just by trusting the supervision entity?

If you can make the process visual, like pulling a paper ticket out of a bowl filled with paper tickets, then you could live-stream a video of you pulling the ticket out. I suggest live-streaming because if you just uploaded a video, customers might think you reshot the video 100 times until you got the result you wanted. Tell customers "we will live-stream the drawing at [some specific time]". Also show customers all the different tickets you are putting in the bowl, and stir the tickets to emphasize the randomness.
