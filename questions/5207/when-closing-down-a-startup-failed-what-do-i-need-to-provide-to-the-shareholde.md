I have a startup, raised some money, struggled to bring the product to market... anyways we are shutting it down.  The investors want to claim their investment as a loss on their taxes.  Do I provide them a form, or is it simply a part of their taxes that they handle?

Want to make sure to take care of them.

**UPDATE:** This is a USA based company.  Specifically Washington state.

It depends on your country.

Fwiw, in France you'd go to court, have a judge liquidate the company, and then provide the investors with a copy of the decision. (Unless the investors are arguing over scraps, they'll usually have agreed on who gets what in advance and the judge will OK it.)

<p>Generally speaking the topic that you're covering is about how to legally dissolve a corporation. To do this, you'll need to deal with employees, investors, <a href="http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&amp;-Self-Employed/Closing-a-Business-Checklist" rel="nofollow">IRS</a>, etc.</p>

<p>Since you're in Washington and this as you know is a pretty sensitive topic, I'm simply going to suggestion that you review Nolo's page on "<a href="http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/how-dissolve-corporation-washington.html" rel="nofollow">How to Dissolve a Corporation in Washington</a>" -- and <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=how%20to%20dissolve%20a%20corporation%20investors%20washington&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8" rel="nofollow">dig around on Google too</a>.</p>

<p>Lastly, I would highly suggest that you get professional advice from a local advisers on closing out your books, contracts, obligations, and representing in legal documents presented on behalf of the company.</p>
