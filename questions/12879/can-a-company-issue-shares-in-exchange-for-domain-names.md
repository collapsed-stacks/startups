I need to issue $100 worth of shares. Each shares are worth $0.00001

Can I able to issue $100 worth of shares in exchange for 8 domains?

The reason I want to do that is because I'm an alien entrepreneur who incorporated a company in US Delaware. 

I need a bank account to prove that I paid money for my initial founder shares. To open a bank account in US, I need to be physically present in the US. At the moment I can't afford that. Thats why I'm trying alternate ways. 

Hope that makes sense.

In principle yes, a company can issue shares (funny money if you will) to buy assets, but that won't allow you to prove that you paid money for your initial founder shares, hence my suggestion in your [prior question](https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/12848/can-i-use-bitcoin-to-buy-my-founder-stocks) to ask your attorney or accountant.

As an aside, are you absolutely sure you need to be physically present to create a corporate account? I haven't looked into this for years but insofar as I can recollect there used to be no shortage of firms that will incorporate an offshore firm for you complete with a bank account. More often than not this involves buying a pre-existing company - you can't pick the name but it comes with a bank account already.

Also, seeing this is the second time you're asking something to the same effect and that you're evidently going to need to jump through hoops to do what you're looking into, are you absolutely certain that you need a Delaware-based business? (Delaware, I'd add, of all places. It's really not the best place to incorporate if you can't afford to interact with attorneys, because it's big money friendly and broke founder/consumer hostile.)

If it's about incorporating in a developed country there are much better places, like [Las Vegas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naDCCW5TSpU) (a quasi tax haven within the US), Estonia, Luxembourg, Malta, etc. If it's about following YC advice on incorporating there it's mostly nonsense IMO - there are plenty of investment opportunities outside of US-based VC outfits, and you can always incorporate in the US later should it turn out to be necessary. And FYI if it's about tax avoidance it's [not a good idea](https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/12779/best-place-to-incorporate-international-startup).
