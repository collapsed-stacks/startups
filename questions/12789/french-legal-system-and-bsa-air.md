This question is mostly relevant in France. Some people would like to invest in a company through BSA AIR ("Accord d'Investissement Rapide" - agreement to buy equity with a discount during the first round of fund raising). And then include this investment in a PEA ("Plan D'Epargne en Actions", a special type of bank account that reduces the taxes on investments in equity, under certain conditions).

However, the BSA contract cannot be bought directly from the PEA. Is it possible that the investor first buys BSA AIR, then after they are converted, we buy the shares, and then he buys the shares again, from the PEA ?

What would be the danger of a such approach ?
