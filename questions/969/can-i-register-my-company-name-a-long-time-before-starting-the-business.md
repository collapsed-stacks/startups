<p>I would like to start a company with a name. I would like to register that name before someone else gets it. But, I don't want to start doing the company work now.</p>

<p>What is the time within which the company should start working after it has been registered?</p>

<p>P.S. I want to register my company in India.</p>

<p>I recently registered my company in India. The process is as below...</p>

<ol>
<li>Get a DSC for each Director \ partner - Digital Signature Certificate </li>
<li>Get a DIN for each Director \ partner - Director Identification Number</li>
<li>Register the company name    </li>
<li>Incorporate the company</li>
</ol>

<p>I believe you want to pause at step 3. 
The registered name will be valid for 3 months or the actual incorporation of the company, whichever comes first. Once incorporated it's your till your company is alive.</p>

<p>It's not 100% sure what you mean, but here are some facts that may help you:</p>

<p>Some jurisdictions will not let you get a name or form an entity until you are actually ready to do business. The Indian government has published some guidance on this <a href="http://business.gov.in/starting_business/registration_business.php" rel="nofollow">here</a>. If in doubt, you should contact a lawyer experienced in working with small businesses in India.</p>

<p>If you just want to get a name, then (I believe) the form you need is <a href="http://www.mca.gov.in/MCA21/dca/downloadeforms/eformTemplates/1030-Form1A.zip" rel="nofollow">this one</a>.</p>

<p>You may also need to register a trade mark or service mark. In most common-law jurisdictions, this is just as important (if not more so) than the name that you give the business entity itself.</p>

<p>You can register a <em>domain</em> name anytime, as long as it's not part of a restricted top-level domain. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_top-level_domain" rel="nofollow">this list</a> for information about generic versus restricted domains. If you are permitted to register the domain you want without forming a business, then you can register it now and transfer the name to the business later.</p>

<p>This may vary by state, but in many states you can reserve a name before registering the business. For example, in New Hampshire, for $15 you can fill out a <a href="http://www.sos.nh.gov/corporate/PDF/Form_1_V-2.0.pdf" rel="nofollow">single-page form</a> to reserve a name.</p>
