I heard that there is a website on which one can check the sales figures of french companies.

Does anyone know this website?

Not sure if any of these are the specific site you're looking for, but in your shoes I'd try the AMF (the French equivalent of the SEC), Insee (national stats agency) and the Minefi (minister of economics and finance):

- http://www.amf-france.org
- http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/document.asp?ref_id=if4
- http://www.economie.gouv.fr/cedef/chiffres-cles-des-pme

Maybe also Boursorama for publicly traded companies, e.g.:

- http://www.boursorama.com/bourse/profil/profil_finance.phtml?symbole=1rPDRTY

Or some googling in French, really. e.g. "Chiffres rapports entreprises" or "bilan et résultat entreprises France". If it's public it'll be listed somewhere.

I don't know what you are looking for exactly when you say looking at french figures but Infogreffe "Registre des commerces et sociétés" is the website where you can see annual balances of a company in exchange for some small fees.
