I have an idea for a Smartphone app and want to get it developed along with my day job, however I am worried about many things even before beginning and request your help, based on folks who already have tested these waters.

- I don't know Android programming and know that I would need to hire a  programmer. But how do I ensure that my idea doesn't get stolen or the code doesn't get copied, especially as I have to hire a freelancer who will work remotely. 
- Would the programmer ask for clear designs (Screen designs, workflow and all required media/theme file etc) or should the same guy be asked to create these as well. I don't know how it happens in Android world, although I think I would certainly need an app designer before I hire a programmer.
- Are there free tools available to design the app on my own, so that I only would need a programmer to implement it?

Thanks a lot.

There are plenty. Look for "wireframing tool". To name a few: Moqup, Balsamiq, Sketch, Invision. Some even let you define and animate application flows between screens, so you can user test the interactions.

You can protect yourself with an IP clause and a non-compete clause in your agreement with them.

But frankly, the best way to not get your idea stolen is to bring something to the table. When faced with what is commonly referred to as "an idea guy", a great developer will often ask him- or herself: "can do, but what do *you* bring to the table?" If the answer is unclear then it's indeed tempting to make do without you. If you demonstrate that you're bringing in proper market insights, domain expertise, administrative skills, a proper sales strategy, and clients, you're well on your way to being viewed as useful to the project.

First of all- be aware that React is a very new framework with limited support. So don't choose it unless you know what you're doing. 

There is no way to prevent code from being stolen, apart from splitting the work between multiple people. Usually your site will be unique enough that people won't want to rip it off. Most companies don't care if their software gets stolen because it just isn't important. 

Some companies hire UX designers to create the design. However, for a small project, you should not have to worry about this as long as the task is clear.

There is really no way to get around programming if your site is complex, but Dreamweaver software will get you started.

As long as you have the freelancer / company sign a contract saying you own all intellectual property and code, if they steal your code / idea - they will not win a legal battle. 

Furthermore, there are plenty of companies out there that build applications for people. In fact, (not trying to do a plug), but I started a business last month that creates apps for people (http://surrogatesystems.com/business.html).

Very hard to hire a good developer. But you can hire on the corssover site. My technical is top of a software company but I did not pass they test. I think you will get a very good developer with they service
