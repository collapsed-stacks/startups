<p>I see three definitions of partner that are at least loosely relevant here.</p>

<p>(1) A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partnership" rel="nofollow noreferrer">partnership</a> is legal entity where the owners are partners.  This one definitely doesn't apply here you are almost surely a corporation or an LLC.</p>

<p>(2) Companies can have other companies be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_partner" rel="nofollow noreferrer">business partners</a> that work together in a commercial relationship. Your investor is not a business partner.</p>

<p>(3) In common language, "<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/partner" rel="nofollow noreferrer">partner</a>" can more broadly mean "one associated with another especially in an action :  associate, colleague".  In this casual sense, you could call your investor a partner, but you do run the risk of confusing others who might think one of the above two definitions apply.</p>

<p>It really depends who you are talking to and the context of the conversation, but if you do call the investor a partner, you should understand the risk of confusion.  </p>
