I am an undergrad student in chemistry, and i have an idea for an application, and how it can be monetized, but my programming skills are limited. Any tips on finding a computer science partner on campus to assist me on building this application? While i focus on other aspects of building the startup

I agree with Kishor, there is a lot you can do without a developer before you look for a comp. sci student. 

To elaborate on the 'wireframe' concept- if you want to make an app, you can create a prototype without coding at all! Just draw/sketch out what each screen would look like, and write out little descriptions of what you would want each button to do. 

That will give comp. sci students more to work with, and thus incentive to want to join your project.

Now- to answer your question, there are many places you can find such students. I studied engineering and had many comp. sci friends, here is what I would recommend:

**1. Student groups.** 
Look for student groups centered around coding for personal enjoyment, hobbyist projects, & entrepreneurship. "Maker Club", "(School Name) Hacker Club, Entrepreneurship Club, etc. Look for a Facebook page or something like that, and see if there is any contact info. Ask if they can connect you to someone in the club, or present your idea at one of their meetings. A surefire way to meet interested students.

**2. Bulletin boards.**
Make a quick flyer that includes *your name, background, contact info* and *your idea for an app*. Make sure it gives a student actual incentive to want to spend their time/energy on your app idea- why should they care? Place these strategically- don't just slap them everywhere- if students see a LOT of them, they will assume you are desperate/spamming people, and that your idea is not worth working on. 

**3. Find out where CS students hangout near you**
Every school has a different culture. Near me, a lot of CS students prefer certain bars, bubble tea shops, coffee shops, etc. Simply going to one and chatting up students who seem to be working on interesting projects is one way of doing things. If they don't want to help, they may know someone who will. This is definitely a social challenge for introverts, but worth a try!

Hope this helps. Best of luck. 

While C.S. students generally focus on software development, don't rule out electrical engineers & computer engineers! They are often quite good too.

There are too many aspects in order to successfully convert an idea to a working application. 

I would suggest you to wireframe your idea first and then look out for skill. If you have limited skills in programming chances are very high that you will not be able to judge the skills of another person as well. 

Take a safer route and make an arrangement of paying for the delivery. Test the features in bits and pieces first.
