I have tons of papers I want to get rid of.

Including my 83(b) election.

Can I just scan it and save it in the cloud then dump like the rest ?

Thanks !

Almost every piece of paper can be scanned and stored electronically now. One exception is documents having a signature or seal. To find out if you need to keep originals contact any authority that might ask you present that document someday and see if they allow scanned copies.

The other thing to keep in mind is that some documents are going to have to be printed out again at a future date in order to meet the requirements of an organization that is stuck in the world of physical paper. We have found that some paper (a very small percentage) is worth keeping to save the time and cost of future printing.
