<p>You don't need a Visa to set up and register a company in the US. The only things you need in practice are a lawyer and an accountant.</p>

<p>There are plenty of options to incorporate. It's usually done in Delaware, but also in Nevada, Florida, and other States.</p>

<p>What you may need is proof of residency of some sort to open an account, but if it applies to the State you're incorporating in it's trivial to work around: have your lawyer incorporate and create the account, then transfer it all to you.</p>

<p>(Aside: there's an additional upside in incorporating in the US: should your investor ever sue, you're better protected as a founder, in that a US investor will have hell collecting in Europe if you're incorporated in the US instead of Europe.)</p>

<p>There's a service to help you with this (not by me, neither am I affiliated with it). Have a look and see if this might be relevant to you. It's called <a href="https://stripe.com/atlas" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Stripe Atlas</a>. They help you with:</p>

<ul>
<li>US company formation</li>
<li>Stripe account (for payment processing)</li>
<li>Bank account and debit card</li>
<li>Other relevant services such as tax and legal advice</li>
</ul>

<p>At the moment this costs $500. Hope this helps!</p>
