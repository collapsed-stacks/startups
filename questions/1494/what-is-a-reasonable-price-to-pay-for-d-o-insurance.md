<p>A 'reasonable' price is subjective so I don't know if I can give that the best answer.</p>

<p>However, for 1 million of coverage you might be able to shop around and find some estimates from different companies. I'm guessing it varies based on your size, the nature of your operations and other things along those lines.</p>

<p>There is a <a href="http://www.costelloandsons.com/vcpe_dando_resources.html" rel="nofollow">statement in here</a> that gives you an estimate on how much it might cost yearly.</p>

<p>Good Luck!</p>
