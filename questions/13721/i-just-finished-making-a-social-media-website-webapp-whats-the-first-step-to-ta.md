<p>This depends on who the social network is for. If you start something like Facebook, it worked to promote it at colleges. If you start something like LinkedIn, you want to target professionals who are looking for business connections.</p>

<p>But regardless, you're going to run into "network effects".  The definition of that is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A phenomenon whereby a product or service gains additional value as more people use it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So at the start, you may not be able to be picky. I would recommend enlisting friends, family, and coworkers. Reach out to everyone on your existing social networks (Twitter, Facebook, etc.). You may be able to bribe/entice strangers to sign up by giving them special perks right at the start. (I'm not sure what those perks might be, but you may be able to think of some:  money, "credits" on your site to "buy" something, special privileges on your site, etc.)</p>

<p>Make sure to include features that make the site spread.  For example, allow fans of your new site to promote it on their existing social networks (Twitter, Facebook) and link back to your new site.</p>

<p>If you know any bloggers, reporters, YouTubers, etc., ask them to do an article or video about your site, or maybe interview you.</p>

<hr>

<p>On a related topic: When I start a business, I always think about a few fundamental things.</p>

<ul>
<li>What is the "elevator pitch" - how do I describe the business to someone in less than a minute?</li>
<li>How will I promote it?</li>
<li>What built-in features will make it spread?</li>
<li>How will I get my first customers?</li>
<li>How will I make money off of it?</li>
</ul>

<p>You can probably find a list of questions like this online, or invent your own like I did. You can answer those questions for this website, and also before you start your next business! :)</p>
