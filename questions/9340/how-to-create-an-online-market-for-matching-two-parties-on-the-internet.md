I am making a job search website. There are two main parties on the site, job seekers and employers. However, job seekers will not pay attention to the service if there are not many employers on the site and vice versa. What is the best strategy to make the two parties to come to use the service on the website and make to market live up?

Job seekers shall give attention to any website as long as there is a single job advertisement in it. You need to focus on bringing in job ads only from the employers.
