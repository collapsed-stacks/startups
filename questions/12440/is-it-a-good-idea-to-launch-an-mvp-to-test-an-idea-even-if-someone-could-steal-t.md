## Is it a good idea to launch an MVP to test an idea even if someone could steal the idea?

Ok, Im a software developer and am entertaining the idea of launching an MVP version of my app to research and see if people like the concept. From there I would build on the app and make it complete. 

In the past I have ONLY shipped complete products, which can take a long time to do well - the downside to this is virtually no research, so if there is no reception I am left with nothing. 

Trying this new approach, I am hesitant only because putting the MVP out there opens the door for another person with more resources to take the idea and make a fully executed version before I can. 

Which approach is better for app development ? Should I worry more or less about competition when testing an MVP?

You can consider signing an NDA from the people whom you are providing to test the product. 
Have different versions of your product like lite, professional, enterprise. Get the feel from users on the lite version and this way they can suggest some recommendations.
Try targeting you user base through Linked IN and see what are the current problems that a product should solve some sort of survey. This way you can pitch your product to them and ask their opinion.

Firstly, it is very rare for someone to steal your idea. At least until it has been proven to be successful.

If someone likes your idea and has more resources then it is more likely that they will let you test the idea, prove its success and then build it themselves. However the success of the business itself is not based solely on the idea but the execution and strategy around it.

Having said that MVPs are difficult to judge as they are not just one thing. Many people see MVP almost like a prototype however, an MVP to see if people like the concept of something could be as small and simple as a landing page. A landing page with mock ups that asked people if they liked the concept, or a form which people fill in which triggers a manual process behind the scenes by people that create an output without programming. The viability depends on what you are testing and who you are testing it for.

I would suggest that an actual app to test if people like a concept is not 'minimum' that less could be done to test that before even building the app - however, we all tend to stick to our strengths and it may actually be quicker for you to throw together an app than to research how to gather opinions on a screen shot.

It would not be the first time that someone has put out a small app to test if people like a concept. However, I think it has to be carefully managed, that it should be with limited numbers who can have close contact with you to ask questions, give feedback etc.

Also bear in mind that feedback on a concept will change dependant on stage - so if you are planning on making this app paid for then people have different considerations. Usually when an app is free then people push for new features, when an app is paid for then they push for stability. The audience changes so you must be sure to ask the right questions of your audience.

so, to summarise:

I would not personally be concerned about someone stealing my idea. But there are legal ways to protect the idea such as patents (which in my experience heavily delay launch and testing)

if testing with an MVP then be sure to know what you are testing for and ask questions of your users to find out what they value in the product (I recommend the book 'The Mom Test', it helps you ask questions of people without them just giving you positive reinforcement)
