Stripe made available a service to let startups incorporate in the United States. ([Stripe Atlas][1])

However, I am living in Canada and all of my operations are made by Canadian citizens.

Would it be a better idea to wait for them to let me incorporate in Canada instead? What would be the downsides of having it incorporated in the US instead of Canada?

*What are you trying to achieve? Mobile payments?* 

Residents can only incorporate a business in the country they are living in - Unless you plan on moving to the US, your only alternative solution is paying someone else to act on your behalf (so you would own all the shares of a US based company). Incorporating in the US means your company would be liable to US taxes (and your company could pay you a salary in Canada, making your income liable to Canadian taxes). At very least it means double the paperwork which could bring increased risk if you upset taxman either side of the border.

*Your question is five days old without an answer - I think if you want a better answer, you will have to ask a better question. Please, don't bundle multiple questions together or you will find they will get voted down leaving you in the dark. I suggest you start with what you want to achieve... Incorporating a business in the US or Mobile Payments? Something else?*
