You can use Facebook advertising to target people that will be able to be delivered.
You have lot of settings for fine tunning of you campaign.

Google DFP is very strong too.

The technique depends a lot on your location in India.

You can always post an ad on Zomato, if your resaurant is in any of the cities which Zomato has an online ordering service.

After you start getting initial traffic, you can always expand to other delivery apps and services like Swiggy, Faasos, etc. (You can also advertise through food blogs, but it isn't as effective as the above method, but is less costly.)

If it is in an area where these major services do not deliver, then the only option for you in the digital marketing aspect would be to use Facebook and Google to do word-targeted digital marketing. 

And also word-of-mouth is a very underrated but a v.v.important digital marketing technique on social networks in India. So, try starting a chain of word-of-mouth sharing or review posting from your closed ones, and see it spread.  Initially, try doing this with people who have a lot of contacts.
