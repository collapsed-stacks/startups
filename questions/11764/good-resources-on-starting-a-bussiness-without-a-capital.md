I would like to startup some small business in the near future, however, I do not have a capital to work with. What I do have are my programming skills, I can develop web applications, mobile applications and can do alright designs, that could be improved with some input from outside people. So I am looking for some resources to get me on the right track. Weather it would be books, blogs, video tutorials or some simple guidelines on how to do this properly.

Thanks for your time and hopefully I have not broken any rules, I just joined this community.

Many (bigger) cities have founder groups that have regular meetings. That would be the first thing I'd look for.

Maybe look for a cofounder, preferably someone who has experience with startups?

One good way to establish yourself is through freelancing. Now, why do you need to establish yourself? You need to have a track record i.e. establish yourself in the domains that you are expecting others to invest. Yes, they are investing in your ability to code, design web site, etc. So, join some freelancing sites and start building your portfolio and establish yourself. With that background under your belt, it would be very easy to attract co-founders/investors. Irrespective of the community size that one lives in just about anyone would like to see a good return  on their investment; a feat that is very possible when you have a good track record. Good luck.
