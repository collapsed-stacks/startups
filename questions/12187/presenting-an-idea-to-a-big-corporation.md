I've a start-up that is specialized in tech solutions, 1 week ago I  met with a potential partner, which is a company that has it's name in the tech industry.

I sat there and talked for hours with the CTO about our solutions and how we can help them to solve some of their major problems, unfortunately he wasn't that interested and he kept on talking about a specific problem that they suffer from and how we can help them to overcome it!
At that time i had no idea on how to address his concerns nor had a solution to his problem.

Anyways the days passed by and some how I think that I've figured out a way to solve their problem, **BUT** this solution requires an internal change and doesn't need any external thoughts on the matter.

So they can actually do it all by themselves as its really easy and simple!

In such a situation what should I do to ensure that they won't do it on their own ?

or should I just present it and expect some appreciation in exchange ?

You see an opportunity to solve big problems. You've been given the opportunity to solve an important problem. So this is a golden chance to earn your spurs.

Me, I would write an email that says, you've thought about the problem he described and you see an internal solution they can apply for themselves. Would they like another meeting?

When you meet, your objective isn't to get paid, it's to solve their immediate problem and pitch to get hired to work on something else, or at least to get sight of another problem that does match your company's distinctive skills.

The complication in trying to get paid for something like this would make you look a bit grasping, which isn't the start you want. But the sense of obligation that comes from giving a valuable gift is something that can work for you, perhaps immediately, or in the months ahead.

You ask: "..what should I do to ensure that they won't do it on their own? or should I just present it and expect some appreciation in exchange?"

Unless the solution is really novel, chances are that someone internal has already recommended the changes. There may be internal business reasons it has not been implemented --yet. The root cause may be cultural or communications issues that block making a change.

The best value is to send a letter for networking value and simply give it to them.

If you have a startup and plan to contact them again, there may be strategic benefit in presenting your solution to the CEO or others in order to get visibility beyond the CTO for your company's value offering.

If you were looking for a job at the company, your solution might be something to tease about in a cover-letter, and offer during an interview --When the interviewer asks if you have any questions.  If they don't hire you at that point, maybe they are not the company you are seeking to work for.

If your solution is novel, legal protections are not in your favor --if only because a company tends to have more legal resources than you.  Options are: 1. Start your own company and implement yourself.  2. Get hired by the company and try to implement internally. Or, 3. Write an open letter or generic blog or article on the topic --being careful to avoid publicly disclosing any of that specific company's private information.

I'd say forget trying to protect yourself. Get a contract that says you will offer a solution to their problem for some amount. Sign the contract. Present your solution. Pray
