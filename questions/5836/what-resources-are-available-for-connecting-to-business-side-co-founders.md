I am a web and mobile app developer. I have built and released several products. I only want to focus on the product development aspect of the business and want to turn over the business side to another co-founder.

For example, [see this answer][1].

What resources are available for me to connect with these people?

<p>There are at least a couple of "match making" sites now, where co-founders can find each other. One of them is <a href="https://www.cofounderslab.com/" rel="nofollow">CoFoundersLab</a>, the other one is <a href="http://founderdating.com/" rel="nofollow">FounderDating</a>.</p>

<p>FounderDating used to charge $50 to sign up and required you to get a voucher from someone on LinkedIn or who is already on it. Included in the $50 is a welcome event where you'll be able to meet with others who have just joined at a local meet-up, which can be fun and useful for making initial contact. After that, though, they do little to help you meet others. In fact, any attempt so far I've seen of members trying to set up additional group-meet-ups on the site, have been shut down. In my personal opinion, the $50 for Founder Dating are not worth it. All this info is a little dated though and may no longer be accurate, so you better investigate for yourself.</p>

<p>On both sites there seem to be quite a few business people looking for a technical partner who'll just implement their idea, or build something cool in an area they are interested and knowledgable in.</p>
