<p>How one can make use of low priced devices (for example Rpi2) for a startup idea? Can we make a complete product with these low priced devices?
I'm particularly interested to know whether a start-up with low priced device (may be a better idea that incorporated along with the device) can really succeed with market trends or not.</p>
