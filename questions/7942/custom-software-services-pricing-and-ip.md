  <p>This question requires an understanding of Software Development/Source
  Code/IP.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lets say I own a software business, specialising in creating custom software.</p>

<p><strong>I can work out my quotations based on projected hours for the project, multiplied by my preferred hourly rate.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Here I get the time I sold to the client</li>
<li>What about the Intellectual Property? (I devoted a lot of time and resources to determine business processes, software processes, ideas etc)</li>
<li>I sell the client the "use" of the software, by the source code stays my property (IP).</li>
<li>The client may not re-sell this software, and only use it per our agreement.</li>
<li>I am selling him "boxed" software (Just like any software he would buy), but with custom features.</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to be successful, I need to make sure I sell my software and my IP at the right price.</p>

<p>I want to offer two quotation options:</p>

<p><strong>Option 1:</strong></p>

<p>I offer a quotation, excluding reselling of the software (It keep the source code)</p>

<p>This I can offer at: Hours * Hourly Rate</p>

<p><strong>Option 2:</strong></p>

<p>The client is interested in obtaining the source code for the custom software. He is tasking me to create a piece of software, that he will outright own, resell, anything goes. Thus I need to charge him more.</p>

<p>I can offer him a quotation at: (Hours * Hourly Rate) + Percentage Factor</p>

<p>As the software does not yet have any real value (Good standing in sales, clients etc), it is difficult to determine a price for this option.</p>

<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong></p>

<p>What is a reasonable, market standard/related percentage to add to my labour, for a complete buy of all source code and IP.</p>

<p>What are your thoughts about this. I am also interested in alternative practices that can be suggested regarding this situation.</p>
