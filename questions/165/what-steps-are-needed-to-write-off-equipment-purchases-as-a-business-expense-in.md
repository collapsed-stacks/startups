I've found [this IRS document](http://www.irs.gov/publications/p535/index.html) that provides a lot of details on business expenses, but didn't find the following information after skimming through it.

* Is any paperwork required before purchase?
* Is it necessary to have the business registered before making a qualified purchase? For example, would a development computer purchased before officially forming the business retroactively qualify?

<p>Generally you can deduct or depreciate equipment, but the rules can vary based on the purchase price.  Since tax laws change year-to-year, you really need to speak to a CPA or do your own research on the <a href="http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&amp;-Self-Employed/Deducting-Business-Expenses">IRS website</a> to see which rules apply to your specific scenario.  Many rules depend on your ownership structure and annual revenue.</p>

<p>No special paperwork is required prior to the purchase but it's a good idea to have receipts for everything.  You do not have to register the business but it's a good idea to open a separate checking account for the business as early as possible.  You can use a personal checking account, but personal accounts have certain restrictions which you may find too limiting, so you may want to open a business checking account.  Opening a business bank account requires you to <a href="http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&amp;-Self-Employed/Employer-ID-Numbers-EINs">register for an EIN</a>.</p>

<p>If you are in the early stages of planning your business, I would highly recommend speaking to someone at your local <a href="http://www.sba.gov/tools/local-assistance/sbdc">Small Business Development Center</a> or contacting a mentor through <a href="http://www.score.org/">SCORE</a>.  They will probably be able to answer most of your questions, and more, in a 1- or 2-hour meeting.</p>
