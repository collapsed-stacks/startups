Can someone tell me why is it so dangerous to split startup company shares 50%-50% between the 2 founders ? 

*Edit : I ask after worked in a company with this repartition.*

You don't see a country with 2 kings (or queens).

No one can be in agreement in forever, especially during tough times.  Someone must make the final decision and move on.

This is not a good idea, because, when crucial decision comes, this can take a long time before having a decision if the two parts are not on the same feeling.
