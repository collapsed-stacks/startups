I am basically finished with the development of my website, and now I am focusing on placing ads. Is it a bad idea to put ads within user-generated articles? It would be the easiest solution, but I am worried that users won't respond very well to have ads in the content they created. Is this not a good idea or will I be okay?

That's what all websites do so you are fine to do so as well. Make sure to use only premium ad networks like Google Adsense.
