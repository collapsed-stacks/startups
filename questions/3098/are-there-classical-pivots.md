<p>Eric Ries’ summary of the top ten types of pivots to consider:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li><p><strong>Zoom-in pivot:</strong> In this case, what previously was considered a single feature in a product becomes the whole product. This highlights
  the value of “focus” and “minimum viable product” (MVP), delivered
  quickly and efficiently.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Zoom-out pivot:</strong> In the reverse situation, sometimes a single feature is insufficient to support a customer set. In this type of
  pivot, what was considered the whole product becomes a single feature
  of a much larger product. (Facebook)</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Customer segment pivot:</strong> Your product may attract real customers, but not the ones in the original vision. In other words, it
  solves a real problem, but needs to be positioned for a more
  appreciative segment, and optimized for that segment. (Twitch.tv)</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Customer need pivot:</strong> Early customer feedback indicates that the problem solved is not very important, or money isn’t available to buy.
  This requires repositioning, or a completely new product, to find a
  problem worth solving. (Yelp, Instagram)</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Platform pivot:</strong> This refers to a change from an application to a platform, or vice versa. Many founders envision their solution as a
  platform for future products, but don’t have a single killer
  application just yet. Most customers buy solutions, not platforms. (Google)</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Business architecture pivot:</strong> Geoffrey Moore, many years ago, observed that there are two major business architectures: high margin,
  low volume (complex systems model), or low margin, high volume (volume
  operations model). You can’t do both at the same time.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Value capture pivot:</strong> This refers to the monetization or revenue model. Changes to the way a startup captures value can have
  far-reaching consequences for business, product, and marketing
  strategies. The “free” model doesn’t capture much value. (Paypal)</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Engine of growth pivot:</strong> Most startups these days use one of three primary growth engines: the viral, sticky, and paid growth
  models. Picking the right model can dramatically affect the speed and
  profitability of growth.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Channel pivot:</strong> In sales terminology, the mechanism by which a company delivers it product to customers is called the sales channel
  or distribution channel. Channel pivots usually require unique
  pricing, feature, and competitive positioning adjustments.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Technology pivot:</strong> Sometimes a startup discovers a way to achieve the same solution by using a completely different technology.
  This is most relevant if the new technology can provide superior price
  and/or performance to improve competitive posture.</p></li>
  </ol>
