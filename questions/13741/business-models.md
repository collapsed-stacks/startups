<p>I want to work in a business model canvas for Panasonic in the smartphone industry.
The problem is that Panasonic is not so focused in this kind of industry. I have read the annual reports of the last years and so many information about this company but barely find something related in the industry of smartphones. I would welcome any report or interesting article that you could suggest that expalins the <strong>strategy</strong> of this company in the <strong>industry I mentioned above</strong>.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
