My startup has a relocation reimbursement policy for its employees.  Does anyone know if temporary storage of employee belongings while they relocate would be tax deductible?

I'm also thinking about reimbursing employee professional dues.  Would that be deductible?

I spoke with my accountant, and, indeed, the short term storage expense while moving was tax deductible.
