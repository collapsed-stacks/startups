<p>My startup has a relocation reimbursement policy for its employees.  Does anyone know if temporary storage of employee belongings while they relocate would be tax deductible?</p>

<p>I'm also thinking about reimbursing employee professional dues.  Would that be deductible?</p>

<p>I spoke with my accountant, and, indeed, the short term storage expense while moving was tax deductible.</p>
