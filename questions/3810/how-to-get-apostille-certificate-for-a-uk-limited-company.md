<p>I'm planning to expand my services abroad and some companies requested Apostille Certificate for that. How I can apply for that or where I can get it?</p>

<p>An Apostille is applied to an individual document; so depending on what your contacts are requiring you may need to get multiple documents 'legalized'. </p>

<p>There are many documents that can have an Apostille applied to them, many of them need to be notarized but most can be a notarized 'true copy'.</p>

<p>You can get this service done by post with the Foreign and Commonwealth office or probably in person as well but I'm not sure on that. See their website for details like <a href="https://pay-legalisation-post.service.gov.uk/start" rel="nofollow">pricing</a> and the long list of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/legalisation-document-checker/y" rel="nofollow">specific document type and requirements for each</a>.</p>
