In the US, sometimes I come across organisations that provide unlimited free coffee (where someone has to volunteer to actually make a whole pot, but all materials are free, courtesy of the org), whereas no free tea bags are provided (even though the hot-water facilities already do exist, as there's already a clean-hot-water-tap on the coffee maker).

Is it beneficial to provide free tea in addition to free coffee, not just as an extra benefits perk, but also as part of a cost-control initiative?

How much is free coffee-by-the-pot more expensive to provide than free tea, if at all?  How beneficial would it be to provide free tea bags in addition to the free-coffee-by-the-pot infrastructure?

*This is the sort of topic they love to discuss ad nauseam on [Workplace](https://workplace.stackexchange.com/). If you're an employee, that might be a better forum for questions like this.*

If you're running a startup and this is the sort of detailed analysis you put into coffee/tea, let me save you a lot of time by advising you to just get ***the best damn tea*** you can find at the grocery store and make it available at no cost to your employees so there is absolutely no chance that you will ever hear a single complaint about the tea. That is the quickest and cheapest way to move on to the more pressing issues faced by your project.
