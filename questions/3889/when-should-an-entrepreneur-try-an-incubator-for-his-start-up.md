<p>I am working on a project which is an e commerce platform. The problem is that it is still under works and will take some time to complete.</p>

<p>My question is that when should i go to an incubator or something similar?</p>

<p>or alternatively should i go to an angel investor to get investment with a business pitch. the funding it self could be used to get the platform ready.</p>

<p>please suggest.</p>

  <p>as per my understanding incubators may help me with this. is it or is my understanding it self wrong..??</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The very definition of an incubator is an institution that helps young companies - definitely they are there to support you. There are several kinds of incubators, choose well.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hi, I want to be king should be the target statement...rich is just an addon for that,..</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You want to be king, so having greater control over your destiny is more important than getting a lot of money. </p>

<p>Most angel investors are chasing a very ambitious return on their investment. Often you must fulfill these expectations or shut down the business (even if it is profitable).</p>

<p>My advice is: take time to get the smartest mentors you could possibly find, as early as possible. Instead of founding your own company, you may consider joining that young startup filled with people smarter than you: you get experience and money that you can use to start your own business later.</p>

<p>Incubator and angel investor are two actually different things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Incubator: If you receive a mentorship of somebody with more experience than you, you will learn actually quicker than alone. If you can join a good incubator (with a lot of good mentors), do it! Just a little warn: you can find people who are not real expert and they just want to take advantage of the entrepreneurs and Startups.</li>
<li>Angel Investor: most angel investors are overwhelmed with a lot of ideas to invest in. There is a small chance of surprising them with just an idea. Most of them will pay attention just if you already have a lot of users (who don't pay) or some clients (who pay).</li>
</ul>

<p>Summing up. I will focus in finding an incubator firstly. Joining your local Startup community could be the first step.</p>
