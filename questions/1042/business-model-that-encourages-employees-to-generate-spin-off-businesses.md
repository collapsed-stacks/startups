<p>In <a href="https://startups.stackexchange.com/a/1033/844">my answer to the question of how Silicon Valley became <em>Silicon Valley</em></a>, I was reminded of the story of Fairchild Semiconductor, a company who thrived while encouraging employees to take their own innovative ideas and create their own new company based on that idea.  </p>

<p>They did this so well that it took a region that had lagged behind in the tech manufacturing industry and catapulted it to the forefront of that field (by not only doing well themselves but also having a network of dozens of successful companies that had sprung up as a result of their original company).</p>

<p>I know there are other businesses that have done similar things (though perhaps not with the same level of result), and I was wondering if there was a name for this.  I'd love to learn more about it and read about more examples, but I'm not sure what terms/phrases to search for.</p>

<p><strong>So here's the core of my question:</strong> <em>Is there a name for this way of structuring your business and employee culture so it encourages and even catalyzes new spin-off businesses?</em></p>

<p>Google encourages employees to spend about 20 percent of their time experimenting with their own ideas and while none have become independent businesses, many are now business units within Google.</p>

<p>This approach created products like: Google News, Google Suggest, Gmail, and AdSense, which is the AD engine that  produces roughly a quarter of Googleâ€™s revenue.</p>

<p><strong>My question to you is why you would take a system that generates internal businesses and spin them off?</strong> (If you provide an answer in the comments below, I'll update my answer to address the problem you're seeing.)</p>
