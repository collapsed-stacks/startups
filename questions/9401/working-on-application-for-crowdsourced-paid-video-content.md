<p>I am thinking of creating a video platform similar to <code>egghead.io</code> where video producers can upload educational videos and get paid royalties based on how many plays their videos get.</p>

<p>I can't seem to find an out-of-the-box solution that would automatically track the plays per content producer and then automatically issue royalty payments.</p>

<p>I was thinking of maybe creating something myself (for you tech geeks out there, I am thinking of maybe using something like the <code>JWPlayer API</code> in conjunction with the <code>PayPal API</code>), but if there is something that already exists to do this, I'd rather not re-invent the wheel.</p>

<p>Does anyone know of such a solution?</p>
