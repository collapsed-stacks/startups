I am thinking of creating a video platform similar to `egghead.io` where video producers can upload educational videos and get paid royalties based on how many plays their videos get.

I can't seem to find an out-of-the-box solution that would automatically track the plays per content producer and then automatically issue royalty payments.

I was thinking of maybe creating something myself (for you tech geeks out there, I am thinking of maybe using something like the `JWPlayer API` in conjunction with the `PayPal API`), but if there is something that already exists to do this, I'd rather not re-invent the wheel.

Does anyone know of such a solution?
