I am about to partially rebuild and relaunch a car show specific map-based directory site, the original is at: http://www.showlocator.co.uk/
(If you want to have a play with it just change the From date to 2014, it will show a load of events on the map, but is not accepting new registrations)

I originally launched in 2015 but despite a great public response had some media backlash as they seemed to think it would stop people buying their papers & Magazines for the events calendar. It is free to use for both visitors and organisers.

I have decided to relaunch in a more niche area, instead of covering ALL car/bike events (a monumental admin task) I will cover the sector that I am most involved in: Classic (and modern) Minis. 

So my question is what would be the best ways to monetize this platform? 
I don't expect £10k a month, but £100 would be nice to cover hosting, admin etc. 
Obviously I will need to build up a sizeable returning userbase before much is possible.

Ideas so far:

 - Ad space (site sponsors + ads)
 - Ticket sales (Take a commission or referral fee)
 - Enhanced listings
 - paid e-Shots to users promoting events
