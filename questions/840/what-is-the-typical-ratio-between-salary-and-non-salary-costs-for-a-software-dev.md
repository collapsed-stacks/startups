As a software developer myself I am aware of the relation between nice work environment and developer's productivity. Free coffee is a must, free coke is a nice to have, free meals are a dream. Obviously the [law of diminishing returns][1] applies. 

What is the typical ratio between salary and non-salary costs for a software developer in your company?

Your questions depends completely on the amount you pay your software developer. 

We'll assume you pay her something like $60,000 yearly - so $5000 monthly. Lets also say you want to go all out by spending $500-$1000 in snacks, coffee and meals monthly. then I guess the ratio would be between 10:1 and 5:1

A simple formula for this would really just be to divide her monthly salary by $1000 or however much you want to spend on food per employee.

Hope this helps, try adding more information like salary, industry, what specifically you would like to provide for employees etc. to get a more detailed answer.
