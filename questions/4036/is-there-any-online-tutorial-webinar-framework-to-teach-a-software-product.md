we are a software company which has successfully build a doctors-software for Mac- and iOS and we are looking to enhance the learning curve of our new customers in a intuitive/effective/self-teaching manner.

We are looking for a service where we can provide video-courses, interactive-walkthroughs (click one of the links on https://university.atlassian.com/uac/2.0/courses/end-user/confluence/v50 to see what I mean) and helpful documents. The sofware-solution should meet several other requirements:

 - Browser-based 
 - Clean/Modern and slightly-customizable UI
 - We would be best suited with a self-hosted service which is open-source or paid once.
 - Optional: Supervisor accounts for team leaders which can keep track of the progress of their employees. 


Thanks for every link and other hints in advance, Dennis

<p>There is a lot out there, and while I have never used it in a live production environment Moodle seems the best option to me when looking at learning new software. If you head over to there website they have a stack of documentation and even a Demo site where you can log on as various roles Teacher, Student, Manager ect. </p>
