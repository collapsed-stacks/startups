<p>My company created TransitArt: Material UI Timetables KIT (<a href="http://transitart.io" rel="nofollow">http://transitart.io</a>). It's a set of services and mobile apps for easy passenger information visualization and integration. Right now we're looking for some high quality feedback about our project. What are some ways of getting it? Usage the Facebook groups have shown no results for us.</p>

<p>I will provide a little bit of general feedback. First, you will want to find someone that is strong in English to fix several confusing grammatical errors (<a href="http://kvp.kdari.com/" rel="nofollow">http://kvp.kdari.com/</a> and many others can help with that) and then find someone like <a href="http://bigfishresults.com/" rel="nofollow">http://bigfishresults.com/</a> or other SEO company, to help you make it clear who you are selling to.</p>

<p>People are going to decide in just a few seconds whether you are what they are looking for and then they will leave. I stuck around a little longer because I wanted to answer this question, but I am still not sure <strong>who</strong> you want to pay <strong>how much</strong> for <strong>what</strong>.</p>

<p>Beyond that, you can get answers to specific business questions on this site. For example, "How do we target businesses and developers at the same time?" The more specific the question the better your chance of getting a good answer. That will probably mean asking quite a few separate questions, but that is fine because many other people are likely to have similar questions.</p>

<p>General usage notes: Check to see if anyone else has asked the same question. If they have, vote for it and join in that conversation as much as you can. Also, remember to vote for and approve answers to all of your questions.</p>

<p>Identify your target audience. Form focus groups from the members of your target audience.</p>

<p>For me, reddit has been a good source of feedback (esp. r/startups).</p>

<p>How to get useful feedback:</p>

<p><strong>The Masses:</strong>
Reddit, Facebook, Twitter, and social media in general. Just make a bunch of posts and ask people for feedback. The plus here is that this is free and easy. It could blow up and suddenly you're getting tons and tons of feedback because people are interested, which is great! The downside here is you're not really hitting your target customer base. You might have a bunch of friends and family on Facebook who would never use your tool in real life think it's great! You might get a bunch of finance nerds in /r/startups say it doesn't correctly address the problem <em>they</em> want, but that may not be the problem you're trying to solve.</p>

<p><strong>The Target Sample:</strong>
Influential people in your target market. Let's say I'm making a wearable to better track soccer players. Calling up the Olympic soccer team isn't likely going to lead anywhere (unless you're a really good salesman!). You are better off finding an amateur target market first. Go to the high school soccer game and offer for them to try it for free. Ask for their feedback. This same thing can work with your tool. Send it to a bunch of bloggers you know and so in exchange for getting the service for free, they'll send you some feedback. Big thing here is to make sure you are actually hitting your target market. You want feedback from people that would actually buy this, not just people who think it is cool. Money is king.</p>

<p><strong>But how do I get the right feedback?</strong>
There are literally hundreds of books on how to get the right feedback from your sample group. One book in particular I highly recommend is <a href="http://www.momtestbook.com/" rel="nofollow">The Mom Test</a>. The big thing to remember is that (usually) people are just nice, and won't want to knock your idea. If you just ask them "Do you like my product" they will say yes, because they don't want to make you feel bad. You have to know how to ask the right questions so you get the best feedback possible. I would highly suggest grabbing a few books and reading up on the subject to make sure you get what you are after.</p>

<p>Yes, facebook groups aren't a nice way of getting product feedback. But some groups, like <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/delhistartups/" rel="nofollow">Delhi startups</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/252440671604769/?ref=br_rs" rel="nofollow">Gurgaon Startups</a>, etc can be really effective. I speak from an Indian perspective. But, I am very positive that there are a lot of similar groups all over the world.</p>

<p>We have used Reddit for product review. The Reddit communities are awesome. They literally take your product for a ride and give you a very detailed reviews, and wonderful criticism.</p>

<p>In addition, there are websites in which the experts from the domian interact. For example, designers and artists wander around in Ello, Dribbble, etc. So, identify such a community site, and post a detailed question, explaining your product, target audience and what it is intending to solve.</p>
