What are the forms that I have to prepare to corporate my organization as it's own entity? Do I have to file any forms federally (US)? What about filing forms for my state? What are the applicable tax laws I should note about starting up? Does the government treat startups differently than growing corporations?

<p>If you're new to the startup scene, you might ask around to see if you are closely connected to a lawyer, or someone with legal experience.</p>

<p>The reality is, you have several options to make your business official in the United States</p>

<p>LLC - Limited Liability Company (the least risk, probably the best for solo entrepreneurs who just need some legal identity for tax purposes)</p>

<p>LLP - Limited Liability Partnership - great for two co-founders to start an entity together (getting legal documentation set up etc.)</p>

<p>S-Corp &amp; C-Corp - made for larger businesses with bigger aspirations (basically capacity for more shareholders and different tax structures, especially for C-Corp).</p>
