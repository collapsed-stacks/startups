I use my own servers (located in a third party data center) for my startup. So, is it possible anywhere in the UK to use the data center's address as my business address for my startup/limited company as well?

You have a contract with the data center that gives you rack space for your server. I trust that it does not give you any administrative services for your postal mail. Some companies do provide these services though... Let's call them "forwarders". They make their address available, you use this as reference with companieshouse and it is also the address that is made public.  

The "forwarders" charge a few hundred pounds a year - that includes the 56GBP per quarter that Royal Mail would want to forward the mail from the "forwarder" to your home. "Regus" office rental offer this service, among others. Years ago one could find these companies advertised in Exchange & Mart believe it or not - under a section called "Company Formations".

An alternative is to contact an accountant. They might offer a cost friendly competitive service if you don't care if the address is premium or not.

Your reasons for retaining privacy might be well intended, but to me, it sounds dodgy.

Lastly, there used to be a law that said the company must be registered at the home of the managing director - I have searched and cannot find reference if this is still true or not. You could always phone companieshouse tomorrow and ask them for clarification.
