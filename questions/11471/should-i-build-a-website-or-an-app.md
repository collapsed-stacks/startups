<p>I've got an idea which was vetted in a hackathon and our team rapidly fell apart afterwards due to politicking and drama. The idea is valid and we got great feedback from a venture capitalist who watched our demo then approached us after the competition.</p>

<p>My question is...given mobile users typically have data streams available to them, is creating a phone app a necessary undertaking or can a website do the same job (when properly configured for viewing on a phone with the same functionality). Why build a phone app when a website can do the same plus also allow regular internet users to access the site as well.</p>

<p>Our initial release for MVP was a phone app but now that the business is mine, I'm wondering if a phone app is the necessary requirement.</p>

<p>It depends on your product. For example if you are entering the property space therefore you believe most of your users will be primarily desktop based then a responsive SPA (single page web app) might be just the right fit. However if the demands of your application are more demanding on the client i.e. a messaging app like WhatsApp or a taxi service like Uber, then device specific distributions would be much more valuable. But your question is quite vague because you don't explain the end requirements of your product</p>

<p>It depends on the app and time or resources you have. But doing mobile app instead of Web app have its advantage like Native look, ability to work offline, pushing notifications, et al.</p>

<p>Can't say which way since I don't know your app nor resources you have and the circumstance you are in.</p>

<p>Why not both? There are technologies that let you do both.</p>

<p>If you use meteor.js(with node.js),you can build the entire web app with it ,run <code>meteor add-platform ios</code> (mixed with a few other commands) and your mobile app is ready to publish.</p>
