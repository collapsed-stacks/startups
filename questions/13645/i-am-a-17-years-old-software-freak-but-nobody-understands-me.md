<p>I am trying to make and ERP software.I have been working on it alone for the last 4 months.But my mom, whenever sees me using my computer, screams at me.She says that my dream is impossible.She wants me to read,go to college and then university and then at one point, get a decent job.But i don't wanna work for anyone.I want to create the best software , and above all, i want to make my dream COMPANY happen.</p>

<p>The reason i'm posting here is because i don't have anyone to support me.I don't have anyone to tell me "KEEP GOING,ONE DAY IT'LL HAPPEN".The thing that i hate the most is not a single person, specially mo own mother doesn't have faith in me....</p>

<p>This world is brutal. Until you don't prove your worth by yourself, nobody gives damn about it.
You are facing so much resistance yet still doing what you love. It proves you are a born Entrepreneur. 
Don't worry. It takes time.
We all are alone somewhere. We all are fighting against something. </p>

<p>Not all the people at your age can understand what they want to do in life, but you understood it. Is not it wonderful? If there is a goal, there will be opportunities. I'm confident, you will be able to find the investors for your project. </p>

<p>Parents always want children to study well, to go to college, then to university, but the only good studying is not a guarantee of a good life, although it is important for mental development. </p>

<p>Believe in yourself and you will succeed!</p>

<p>build and small demo version, 
contact small companies around your area and offer your demo as a free tool, your payment will be the actual validation of the users to tell you if your project is useful or not, </p>

<p>protect your software, </p>

<p>once the final product is done, protect it with copyright so the company can use your software for free but not distribute it. </p>

<p>after you get the feedback from that company find a way to sell it to others, </p>

<p>once the company has your software, they might want to hire you if you prove you can provide them more support or sell them more ideas. you can take that chance or find a way to sell your validated product to a new company with a price in actual money (I recommend selling the product for a cheap price, but offering a set of services, like support, training and future upgrades)</p>

<p>just remember, the software is yours, not theirs, you sold it for free, but you can charge others. </p>

<p>lastly, never stop working on your products and make your relationship with the companies you contacted deeper. </p>

<p>when the company is giving you feedback they will ask you to build products for their specific use, when this happens DON'T add it to your platform, build a separate one for their specific need and sell it as a different product, you have to learn to differentiate what is your software and what is theirs. if that's something that can be sell to others, then is yours; but if is something they are asking, then is theirs, you can keep some knowledge, but as you are building something for them, then you have to ask for additional compensation. </p>

<p>you can give the same service to other companies. offer your initial product to enter into their business, then sell customizations. </p>

<p>later if you want to increase the value of your current platform, then add the customizations to your base product.</p>
