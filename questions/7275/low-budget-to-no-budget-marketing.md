<p>I'm trying to get a skin care business, to be successful, and I believe that marketing it would be a great idea, the business is in a really great area, but it just needs some attention.
My question is: How do I successfully, market, and engage a lot of people on low to no budget plan. It's on Instagram, as a I believe the most amount of people will see, and it'd get the most attention, in the area, with location based "tags" and location based and relevant hashtags.
What else could I do? Any advice would be wonderful / steps on what to do next.</p>

<p>We're located in Los Angeles, C.A.</p>

<p>Your very best bet for early marketing is word of mouth. Referrals are key. If you have a handful of customers, offer an incentive for a friend or family member of theirs to come try you out. Then ask each and every one of them for a review of your services.</p>

<p>You need:
1) a website (must be mobile-friendly!)
2) a yelp account
3) a google places account</p>

<p>Get your new service reviewed enough times and have a mobile-friendly website, THEN you're ready to start advertising and marketing at a higher volume. Before you do those things, there's often no reason to pour a lot of time or money into other kinds of marketing tactics.</p>

<p>Think about it: what's the first thing you do when you're looking for a business or service? Google it. Then you look at how many stars they have before you make a phone call. </p>

<p>Hope that helps! </p>
