<p>I am wishing to target Facebook users who have a specific email domain. For example I only want ads to be shown to people with an @funsite.com (just an example). To be clear I do not have any of the full emails, so I do not have the option to just use a list of custom emails.</p>

<p>I don't think it is possible. However, you could target each individual name individually. In theory, you could get a list of publicly known emails from a tool like Email Hunter. </p>

<p>However, please read the following from the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/manage/customaudiences/tos.php" rel="nofollow">Custom Audience terms</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You represent and warrant that you (or your data provider) have
  <strong>provided appropriate notice to and secured any necessary consent from
  the data subjects whose data will be hashed to create the Hashed Data</strong>,
  including as needed to be in compliance with all applicable laws,
  regulations and industry guidelines.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In my interpretation (and I am not a lawyer), this makes your approach against the terms and conditions Facebook has set. (The terms 'appropriate' and 'any necessary consent' seem vague in these terms, but as I said I am not a lawyer).</p>

<p>You cannot do any domain, but you can target all of the major ones (e.g. Gmail, AOL, Yahoo, Microsoft). Under targeting, type "Primary Email Domain" or "Gmail Users", etc. </p>
