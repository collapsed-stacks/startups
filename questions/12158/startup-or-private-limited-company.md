We have two directors and we incorporated a Private Limited Company in India recently with Rs. 100000 initial capital, and shares of Rs. 10 each. Can we consider my company as startup company? Or does any third party has to certify about my company being a startup or not? Can I take benefits for my company or not? If so, how and when?
