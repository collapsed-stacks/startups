I can give you several strategies:

1. Target professional painters, who needs paint everyday. Check local directories, online sites, like Yelp, Yellow Pages etc. Make a cold calls, give them discounts. They will buy paint from you in volume, so it will help your business grow. Build a referral network (give current customers bigger discount, if they will bring friends).
2. Advertise. Start campaign on Facebook or Google, target painting professionals and new home buyers.
3. Focus on current customers, provide them the best service, ask for their recommendations in social media. Good reviews on Yelp and Google Maps will magically drive new customers. Reputation is a key for success.

At some point you will have to entice clients from competitors because market is not that big. For that you will have to learn a lot about competitors and turn their weaknesses into your strengths. For example, if they work 8am-5pm, you have to work 7am-8pm for example, so people can come to your shop after work.
