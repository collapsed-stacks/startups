<p>I am involved with a newly launched (currently in open beta) 3D printing marketplace, where we aim to connect shoppers, inventors, makers and designers on our platform and make 3D printing accessible to all.</p>

<p>And for this I would like to extend an invitation to designers and modelers to try out the site, give feed back and showcase their design and enable them to earn money out of it. </p>

<p>So, what's the best way to find an existing pool of talented designers to have them on board, have them  sign up and try out our platform and give their valuable feedback.</p>

<p>P.S: I am not sure if I am allowed to mention the name of the startup, hence the non disclosure.</p>

<p><em>INDUSTRY</em> forums for the various groups - like SolidWorks/Inventor/etc forums, maker forums, CAD forums, Eng-Tip forums, etc. would be good places to put out the word.</p>

<p>You can give a try to <a href="http://freelancers3d.com/to" rel="nofollow">http://freelancers3d.com/to</a> find 3D Graphic Designers. Along with that you can use designers portfolio sites like <a href="https://www.behance.net/" rel="nofollow">https://www.behance.net/</a> and business social network like LinkedIn.</p>

<p>You could check out engineering labs at universities. These universities may have several students who are talented in 3d printing and have the time/motivation to get involved in a new platform and give pro-bono  feedback (also if they can make an extra buck that would be motivating to unemployed students also!)</p>

<p>My comprehension on your business model is that you are looking to enjoin or connect the jobbers with the work available across the spectrum. It is actually a two pronged model where you shall have people looking forward to get their job done. This happens if you have a pool of talent on your portal.</p>

<p>I think for this you need to drive members/designers aka modellers etc to your portal. Now this is where you need to take the help of on line media opportunities to enable programs to drive them to your portal. It all depends how you want to go ahead. A strong marketing strategy combined with projected outcomes needs to be in place to drive the motive/s</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
