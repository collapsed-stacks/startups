I'm comparing notes here. I've found it's often 6-8 months, in Toronto, Canada at least. (Starting from the day you commit to make the idea a startup.) Less if you're in a top incubator. What is your experience?

The founder of Pandora answered a similar question by stating

So your question, while you might be trying to draw some mathematical formula, is largely too dependent to gather significant data.

What you might want to do is gather a table of competitors and similar businesses that have similar structures, and analyze their data about timing with different rounds in their investment stages.

Otherwise, you might just be making blind shots in the dark. That's no fun.
