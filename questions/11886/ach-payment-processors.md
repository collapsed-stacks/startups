Are there any ACH payment processors that will work with a (low volume) startup?  Even a third party that can run the ACH payments on my behalf, I think would be acceptable.  I've seen volume pricing as low as $0.25 per transaction, but I think my model would be fine with transactions costs with as high as $5 or so, if that's what it takes.  I expect my average transactions to be around $2,000 per week per client.  Any ideas or suggestions are welcome.
