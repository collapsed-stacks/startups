<p>I have a free accounting web app that requires registration. My user base has been steadily but consistently growing over the past 1.5 years. I'd like to know if there is any specific ad-platform that caters to such a use case?</p>

<p>Obviously the app has no crawlable content, since it is mostly numbers and requires registration.</p>

<p>Trying to monetize this using ads sounds weird. They'll distract users from getting their work done, or gobble up precious screen real estate. The point here is, ads might actually annoy your users.</p>

<p>Instead, consider enriching your users' experience by providing value-added services and info-products. Research and identify the intent of your clients, and the precise problems they're trying to solve when they use your app. (Literally ask them, and do some keyword research to boot.)</p>

<p>From there, you should be able to pinpoint the types of services and information that you could sell or resell. For instance, an eBook on accounting tips or financial planning tips or whatever, or an accountant to review their accounts and deliver tax advice (they'd probably pay good money for qualified leads).</p>

<p>I'll think about another way to monetize it as Denis said.</p>

<p>Anyway I have always listened that the ad from Google is the one which gives you more money. For Android: <a href="https://developers.google.com/mobile-ads-sdk/" rel="nofollow">https://developers.google.com/mobile-ads-sdk/</a></p>

<p>No idea about iPhone.</p>
