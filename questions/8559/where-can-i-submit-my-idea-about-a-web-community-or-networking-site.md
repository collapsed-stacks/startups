<p><em>I have an idea for a website which is an online community with various sub communities and discussion groups etc. Also it will be a huge community and members from several fields.</em> </p>

<p><strong>But where can i submit my idea</strong>. I can't do crowdfunding since it is a fairly large project and its just me alone. <strong>Is there any web innovation contests or a place where i can share my idea so that it gets noticed</strong>?</p>

<p>PS: I can't do the development myself since its really challenging. Also <strong>i have the complete idea with all the necessary plans and execution methods. But need support.</strong></p>

<p>There are two different aspects you need to touch upon:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Finance: If you are looking for funding, then you need to prepare a business plan, identify the funding type you need (debt / equity), and funnel the cost to proceed further.</p></li>
<li><p>Engineering: You have the budget, and you need the support intellectually, then your first step is to open a repository in Git, broadcast in ICQ for support. Initiate and begin the journey. </p></li>
</ol>
