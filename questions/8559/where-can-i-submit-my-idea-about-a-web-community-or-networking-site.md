*I have an idea for a website which is an online community with various sub communities and discussion groups etc. Also it will be a huge community and members from several fields.* 

**But where can i submit my idea**. I can't do crowdfunding since it is a fairly large project and its just me alone. **Is there any web innovation contests or a place where i can share my idea so that it gets noticed**?

PS: I can't do the development myself since its really challenging. Also **i have the complete idea with all the necessary plans and execution methods. But need support.**

There are two different aspects you need to touch upon:

1. Finance: If you are looking for funding, then you need to prepare a business plan, identify the funding type you need (debt / equity), and funnel the cost to proceed further.

2. Engineering: You have the budget, and you need the support intellectually, then your first step is to open a repository in Git, broadcast in ICQ for support. Initiate and begin the journey.
