<p>I tried to find a real world problem in the market. But its very hard without knowing the specific market. My bro told me that idea does not matter, what matters is how much you can progress in it. So i picked up a simple POS idea for the people in the market accessible to me. Here is what i am facing today that is stopping me from building the product : </p>

<ol>
<li>People don't know how to use POS or android app.</li>
<li>I don't have a team working for this idea. Product manager gave up and left. </li>
<li>Without team, i can't cover market.</li>
<li>Different shops need different POS. Hence i can not generalise.</li>
<li>I tried to gather marketing team on commission basis. But i don't know if people will buy the POS, they might have lied at the time when i researched.</li>
</ol>

<p>Going through this, i have come to conclusion that everybody in market needs something different. I am thinking to go in shops, ask them if they need any custom android app, if they need, i will discuss the requirement and build the app for them and charge them accordingly. Completing app will be slow process and i am finding it hard to finish app without good amount of money. With money there comes value and urgency to the app. This is how i am thinking to connect to businesses in market with my One person company. Is this the best way or there is anything better than this flow ? Or being alone, it would be best to get a android job ?    </p>

<p>You did not specify exactly why you want partner? People hire/find partner in business can have various reason. i.e money investment, time investment, because of some special skill etc.</p>

<p>As far as I see , Your idea about business is not bad , All you need to change is marketing strategy. </p>

<p>First define your goal that what you want to target as customer? Local audience , Limited to country or international? Once you define it then think about how you will do marketing.</p>

<p>If you want to target local area then news paper, TV ads. are best way to market your product , and for more you should have website which explain about you, your company and your product. Online marketing through website is also effective if it handle by expert. You can use techniques like <strong>SEO</strong> , <strong>SMO</strong>.</p>

<p>Rather than partner you can hire 2-3 people who can handle above things perfectly. Still requirement of partner is depends on you that how and why you need partner.</p>

<p>Think about your product that if someone else come to you to sell that product what you think? what features you expect? what price you find reasonable to buy that? This will help you to think from perspective of end user. This is process of analysis but very helpful. Based on that you can improve your product.</p>

<p>Idea is only Idea until you implement and market it successfully.</p>
