I am trying to understand all the tasks I have to do to run my back office and be compliant with the all the corporate laws, taxes etc...

The way I understand it, in the US there are 2 main areas :

HR

 - Sign contracts with my employees. With mandatory max work time and min vacations.
 - Pay mandatory benefits for them (health insurance etc...)
 - Pay 401k (retirement?) for them
 - Pay actual salaries
 - Pay taxes for them ? (or do they pay it by themselves ?)

Accounting

 - Keep all receipts and classify them. To calculate taxable income
 - Reference all receipts to bank transactions. Submit this report to the government.
 - Pay state taxes (could be a franchise tax, could be based on my income)
 - Pay federal taxes based on taxable income

Did I forget any mandatory back office task? Is there a tax I didn't mention or a mandatory thing to do ?

There are tons of guides or softwares for each items, but no exhaustive list so far.

Thanks !

Remit to the Fed and the State the payroll taxes withheld from employees and your own pay, as well as the social security and medicare taxes, every week when payroll is done. It's best not to fall behind. 

Similarly, if you have to collect state sales tax then remit that collected money to the state regularly when it is due.
