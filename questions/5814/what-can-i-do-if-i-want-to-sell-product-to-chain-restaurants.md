I come up with an idea that is supposed to help restaurants save costs and make more revenues. But for the first stage, I would like to talk to them about this idea and listen to their opinions and concerns. What can I do to reach them?

<p>You could take a look at <a href="http://restaurantengine.com/" rel="nofollow">http://restaurantengine.com/</a>, a product helping to create restaurant websites built by <a href="http://casjam.com/" rel="nofollow">Brian Casel</a>, and see if you find information about restaurant engine's primary audience.</p>

<p>Brian also runs a podcast called <a href="http://bootstrappedweb.com" rel="nofollow">bootstrapped web</a> in which he gives advice to other startup founders. Maybe reaching out to him personally would also help.</p>

Create a pilot program and test it within a closed circle of your potential clients. Involve some local restaurants, if they are interested. Talk to people.
