1. You must first obtain a [Google Account](https://accounts.google.com/), which requires a **valid email address** (a link that you will require will be sent here).

2. You can then [apply for an AdSense account](https://www.google.com/adsense/signup), for which you will have to provide the following information:

    * the **hostname** and **language** of the website(s) on which you will display Google ads&mdash;note that [only certain languages are supported](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/9727) (and Hindi is not one of them); and

    * your **contact information**, including:

        * your **country** (i.e. that in which your bank account is held) and **timezone**;

        * your **account type** (i.e. whether the bank account into which payments will be made is in the name of an *individual* or a *company*&mdash;both are supported, but once submitted [this option cannot be changed](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/160201) without closing the AdSense account and applying for a replacement);

        * the [exact](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/47333) **name of the bank account**&mdash;for Indian accounts, [this cannot be changed once the application is submitted](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/160202);

        * a **valid postal address** (a PIN that you will require will be sent here); and

        * a **valid telephone number** (a PIN that you will require will be sent here).

    Once your application has been approved, the default position is that you will receive [payments by cheque](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/1316738) (in US Dollars or Indian Rupees) to your postal address.  Until earlier this year, this was the *only* means of payment in India.

3. [Since March of this year](https://productforums.google.com/d/msg/adsense/Z_rGJ_uYud0/CsqCffq1lDsJ), Google has been offering Indian customers a *trial* of [payment by wire transfer](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/6025222) (in US Dollars).  To set it up, you must provide Google with:

    * Your **bank account number**;

    * The **name of the account holder**;

    * Your **bank's SWIFT code**;

    * Your **bank's name**; and

    * Your **Indian Financial System Code** (IFSC).

4. With regard to taxation, you must:

    * either **confirm that you do not undertake any [US Activities](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/18372)** or else obtain &amp; provide US taxpayer details; and

    * **report and pay any Indian taxes** that become due on the payments that you receive (unless Google informs you otherwise&mdash;see the [AdSense terms and conditions for India](https://www.google.com/adsense/localized-terms?rc=IN)).

   Finally, as noted under [Tax Information](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/3025029):

    > [I]f your local government requires that you send supplementary
    > tax information or a tax invoice, you may send it to the address
    > below. Please be aware that we do not process all forms or invoices.
