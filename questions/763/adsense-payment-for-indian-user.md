<li><p>You must first obtain a <a href="https://accounts.google.com/" rel="nofollow">Google Account</a>, which requires a <strong>valid email address</strong> (a link that you will require will be sent here).</p></li>
<li><p>You can then <a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/signup" rel="nofollow">apply for an AdSense account</a>, for which you will have to provide the following information:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>the <strong>hostname</strong> and <strong>language</strong> of the website(s) on which you will display Google ads&mdash;note that <a href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/9727" rel="nofollow">only certain languages are supported</a> (and Hindi is not one of them); and</p></li>
<li><p>your <strong>contact information</strong>, including:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>your <strong>country</strong> (i.e. that in which your bank account is held) and <strong>timezone</strong>;</p></li>
<li><p>your <strong>account type</strong> (i.e. whether the bank account into which payments will be made is in the name of an <em>individual</em> or a <em>company</em>&mdash;both are supported, but once submitted <a href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/160201" rel="nofollow">this option cannot be changed</a> without closing the AdSense account and applying for a replacement);</p></li>
<li><p>the <a href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/47333" rel="nofollow">exact</a> <strong>name of the bank account</strong>&mdash;for Indian accounts, <a href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/160202" rel="nofollow">this cannot be changed once the application is submitted</a>;</p></li>
<li><p>a <strong>valid postal address</strong> (a PIN that you will require will be sent here); and</p></li>
<li><p>a <strong>valid telephone number</strong> (a PIN that you will require will be sent here).</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Once your application has been approved, the default position is that you will receive <a href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/1316738" rel="nofollow">payments by cheque</a> (in US Dollars or Indian Rupees) to your postal address.  Until earlier this year, this was the <em>only</em> means of payment in India.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://productforums.google.com/d/msg/adsense/Z_rGJ_uYud0/CsqCffq1lDsJ" rel="nofollow">Since March of this year</a>, Google has been offering Indian customers a <em>trial</em> of <a href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/6025222" rel="nofollow">payment by wire transfer</a> (in US Dollars).  To set it up, you must provide Google with:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Your <strong>bank account number</strong>;</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>name of the account holder</strong>;</p></li>
<li><p>Your <strong>bank's SWIFT code</strong>;</p></li>
<li><p>Your <strong>bank's name</strong>; and</p></li>
<li><p>Your <strong>Indian Financial System Code</strong> (IFSC).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>With regard to taxation, you must:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>either <strong>confirm that you do not undertake any <a href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/18372" rel="nofollow">US Activities</a></strong> or else obtain &amp; provide US taxpayer details; and</p></li>
<li><p><strong>report and pay any Indian taxes</strong> that become due on the payments that you receive (unless Google informs you otherwise&mdash;see the <a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/localized-terms?rc=IN" rel="nofollow">AdSense terms and conditions for India</a>).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, as noted under <a href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/3025029" rel="nofollow">Tax Information</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[I]f your local government requires that you send supplementary
  tax information or a tax invoice, you may send it to the address
  below. Please be aware that we do not process all forms or invoices.</p>
  
  <p>Google Asia Pacific Pte. Ltd.<br/>
