I've come up with idea for SaaS startup, which I will pursue with my friend. Potential disagreements between the two of us aside, should we make a company before launching? Or can we just build MVP, launch and validate that idea first(that means see if there are people willing to pay for our service)?

I'm asking mainly because of certain liabilities which can occure when something goes wrong. We will prowide API for web sites and mobile apps.

Or is putting some terms of service, e.g. like [iTunes][1] has enough for us to be safe?

SaaS ideas generally start off with a limited-user product, so that they can rigorously test user behaviour, gauge the market and also define the key metrics for growth.

**This seems a fairly good idea**. There are several forums through which you can get early adopters, like reddit, product hunt, etc.  (We got through reddit's startups forum.) 

So, instead of spending valuable time setting up and company without even knowing whether the product having taken off, or much worse without knowing whether there is a market for the product, would be a huge overhead both personally and professionally.
