<p>As in a startup environment everything is highly unsure, how would you define smart targets?</p>

<p>We have a MVP ready (<a href="http://mandelkind.biz" rel="nofollow">http://mandelkind.biz</a>) and are now trying to accomplish "proof of market". The target audience is defined (one-man-shows and freelancer, mainly women starting self employment).</p>

<p>Now how should we start best for positioning and measure market acceptance?</p>

<p>MVP stands for Minimum <strong>Viable</strong> Product. Minimum as in it includes just what you need to sell it. Viable as in you're able to sell it repeatedly and often enough that the project can move forward.</p>

<p>You <em>cannot</em> come up with an MVP product in isolation. You must interact with end-users to gather their requirements, sit with end-users to UI/UX test mocks and prototypes, test how much they're willing to spend on it by actually selling it, identify what's missing or most important to them as you do, and subsequently nail down the key must-have functionalities you need to make them pull out their checkbook - <em>that</em> is an MVP.</p>

<p>What you have now is - at best - a Minimum Product. And if you're like most startups, it is not minimum at all and there is no guarantee it can sell. Try to sell first; then build.</p>

<p>Go meet your target audience at local meetups. And collect their feedback face to face.</p>
