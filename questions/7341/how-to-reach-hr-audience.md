We've got a fairly well established SaaS Service, but we need to increase our marketing efforts to reach more potential customers. 
When we actually get in contact with the right persons (CEO, HR, Team-Admins) we manage to sell our product quite often. 

So apart from Google, how would you reach out to an HR audience?

E-mailing them is one of the ways, but most e-mails remain unanswered for many reasons, maybe because they are just left to rot in the "read" folder or just left on the to-reply list and never returned  to.

However, HR's are really active on LinkedIn, and most of them do read their Inmails, unlike the regular emails. So, subscribing to one of LinkedIn plans which gives unlimited Inmails would be a nice way to go.

LinkedIn has a very nice search feature, where you can search for people specifically with their designation as a search query. 

So, Inmailing through LinkedIn is one outbound technique, and the emailing one which @DenisdeBernardy mentioned is another technique.

However, as the target audience are HR's, I would suggest you invest in the LinkedIn technique.

Per the email I sent Nik (you?), a good way to reach them is to plow through job posts with that contain an email address, and/or cross reference job posts with other datasets that lead you to the right person. One way to get these job postings is to scrape them, or simply buy them from an existing provider - such as [Scrapinghub](http://scrapinghub.com). (Disclaimer: working there.)

From there, do outbound the usual way:
