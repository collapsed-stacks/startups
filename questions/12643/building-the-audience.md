This is definitely a broad question, however to gain any type of popularity the market today there are many ways to make good use of your social media marketing, and consumer engagement potential.

Reach out to influencers: Find influencers in your niche and then share their content, tag or mention them, or comment on their blogs. As you build relationships, they are more likely to share your content with their followers.

Post original, relevant content: This requires some outside-the-box thinking. Sharing other people's content should be a valuable part of your strategy, but make sure to share your knowledge and insights as well.

Be responsive: Posting engaging content is just one piece of the puzzle. Respond to questions, comments, and complaints in a timely manner.

Streamline your efforts: Being active and engaged on a few social networks will net you more followers over the long haul than sporadically posting on many networks.

Cross-promote your social media accounts: Periodically promote your other social media accounts to your fans and followers.

If you have limited time and resources to commit to social media, I'd recommend choosing a few key strategies and then making sure you carry them out consistently.
