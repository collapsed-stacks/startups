<p>Maybe it's a difficult question ? I will love know other points of view.</p>

<p>So, I have a modest business that has begun to grow from 2 co-founder.
Actually we are 4, and at this point we need new "no-founder" people to handle the grow.</p>

<p>But, we are stuck ideologically with the wage (slave) and the traditional way to build enterprise social architecture looking like a pyramid.</p>

<p><strong>Do you have any solutions on how to handle this?</strong></p>

<p><strong>How would you create a social structure where all the actors are masters?</strong></p>

<p>Like a Zero-sum game. It is possible to have only winners ? what to you think on a philo-side and social-side ?</p>

<p>Speak your mind :)</p>

<p>I think you need to be separate the idea of roles/responsibilities with the worker/slave idea. Just because someone is a <strong>worker</strong> doesnt mean they are a slave, they can still contribute and be valued in their ideas and effort and be recognised in some way.</p>

<p>Not everyone is equal. Someone who has 40 years of sales experience will be of more profit making value to the company than an intern who is learning to write computer code. But all contribute to the success of the overall company</p>

<p>I would consider these principles</p>

<ul>
<li>Pay everyone a fair way for their experience and job role</li>
<li>encourage good communication at all levels of the company, everyone has a voice, everyone has ideas that are worth considering to improve the company</li>
<li>Everyone should receive shares in the company. This can be based on longevity or contribution or another facet. When the company makes a profit and a dividend is declared, then all benefit.</li>
</ul>

<p>Consideration needs to be made of <strong>control</strong> within the company, if there are 100 employees and each has 1% of the shares, then legal decision making becomes interesting and could become a lobbying process.  </p>

<p>I am bossy &amp; can't work horizontally. Last year I started a green electronic startup. I hired VHS&amp;college students. Paid them per-project, because it's easier to decide the amount of their salary based on the cost of goods.</p>

<p>Talking about the philosocial side, our motto is "Innovate to Elevate" and it's not too difficult for me to get my first funding as it's related to green issues. Based on Nielsen report, consumers are willing to pay extra for products from companies that give back to society. When asked which causes companies should support, respondents prioritize environmental sustainability (62%), improvements to STEM education (56%), eradication of extreme poverty&amp;hunger 53%.</p>

<p>I'm not saying that hiring students is part of improving STEM education. I'm not hiding under this sugar-coated "education improvement". It's just my strategy=</p>

<p>I lead these students from the back, and let them believe they're in front.</p>
