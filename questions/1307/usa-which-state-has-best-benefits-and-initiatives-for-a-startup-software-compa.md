<p>The question that you might really want to ask is: "What state has the best tax incentives for a software company?"</p>

<p>Part of this has been answered here (Thank connor from the comments):
<a href="https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/585/why-incorporate-in-delaware">Why incorporate in Delaware?</a></p>

<p>But it makes the most sense to invest a small amount of money in an informational interview with an accountant to give you some advice on this topic specific to your sole proprietor situation if it will soon be your livelihood.</p>
