<p>It seems to me like everyone who had large (say 100mm+) exits before age 30 either relied heavily on illegal activity or built some sort of flash in the pan product.</p>

<ul>
<li>Zuckerberg, for example, seems to have just copied what other people around him were doing and bore more risk and lawsuits.</li>
<li>Michael Dell got started blatantly cloning IBM hardware.</li>
<li>David Karp built a great site but it turned out to be worth way less afterward. </li>
<li>And of course, there's Steve Jobs and the blue boxes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please change my cynical worldview. I'm sure that there are lots of people over 30 who suceeded, it just seems that the only way for young people to break into tech is to do something illegal or scammy.</p>

<p>Firstly, I would start by pointing out a quote by Mary Kay Ash:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ideas are a dime a dozen. People who implement them are priceless.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the quote is self-explanatory about the claim against Zuckerberg and some more successful entrepreneurs who were accused of "stealing ideas".</p>

<p>And, regarding the Steve Jobs and Michael Dell case, I don't think copying ideas is bad in the startups world. In fact, it is done more often than not. <strong>If you don't keep innovating, you lose your market share to someone who does.</strong></p>

<p>And this proved right in their case. And there are several others who have done the exact same thing and are unicorns now. (Example: Ola and Lyft vs Uber).</p>

<p>And considering Steve Jobs, there might be a bit of a betrayal angle to the story, but at the end of the day, it all boils down to the above point and innovation.
And Steve's company and his principles after he built Apple and the way he led the team to be unique in it's own way, speaks for himself.</p>

<p>So, to make my point clear, <strong>I don't see these as scams.</strong></p>
