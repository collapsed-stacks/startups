<p>Say we start up as a partnership,
with a partnership agreement we have written.</p>

<p>some time (days, months) down the line, we mutually decide we want to change the partnership agreement.
perhaps change a clause, perhaps add or remove a partner.
Perhaps we have made enough money that we can afford to hire a solicitor to write up a partnership agreement that is clear, ironclad and good.</p>

<p>So to do that we dissolve the partnership, <strong>payout</strong> everyone's portion of the assets (or debts),
create and sign, the new agreement, everyone <strong>pays back in</strong> their assets (possibly with some changes, but with the partnership getting back it's non-cash assets whole),
and we continue trading.</p>

<p>Is there anything that stops us doing this several times in the first year?</p>

<p>Are there issues with having a ABN? (Australian Bussiness number), or is the ABN just another asset: that we can temporary give out to the partners then have them give back?</p>

<p>This is in Western Australia</p>

<p>Your plan sounds insane. While it's probably theoretically possible, why do you want to burden yourself with immense amount of paperwork, when all you really need is a partnership agreement that allows for changes? Does a law firm dissolve and lose all their clients each time they add a new partner?</p>
