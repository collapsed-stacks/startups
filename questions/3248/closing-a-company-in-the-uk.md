Context:

I started a side project 10~ months ago which I decided to register a Ltd company for in order to ease the legalities of taking income however very soon after starting I was offered employment that I couldn't refuse and so my company was never traded with, never employed staff, and was completely dormant in the eyes of trade.

Question:

What is the most efficient and legal way to dissolve this company and do I need an accountant to file my accounts with 0 income and 0 overheads?

You'll want to [strike off the company](https://www.gov.uk/closing-a-limited-company) after getting things in order with Companies House and HMRC.

It's not super hard to do, and you don't need an accountant. However, Companies House can be picky when it comes to form, so imho an accountant will be worth the money if you go down that road.

(Note, by the way, that the company can remain dormant for as long as you want if you don't mind the paperwork you'll need to file yearly with Companies House and HMRC.)
