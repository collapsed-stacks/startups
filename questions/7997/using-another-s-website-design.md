<p>I would like to use another website's design in building my own. I have no intent on copying any of the code, but I really like the way it is laid out and the fonts that are used.</p>

<p>Is it illegal for me to use the websites design but write my own code for the site? The content will, of course, be different.</p>

<p>In short, yes.</p>

<p>As long as you aren't copying "content" or any branding like logos you should be fine.</p>

<p>In fact, it's highly likely the site is using a pre-made template if they are using a popular CMS like WordPress.</p>

<p>A lot of times you can actually look at the code of their site and see what the name of the CMS and template they are using is.</p>

<p>Then it's only a matter of Google searching the template name and likely you will be able to find it available to purchase.</p>

<p>Of course, if they have a completely custom coded site there won't be a template but these days "most" websites are run on some sort of CMS and with a design template that they purchased somewhere like ThemeForest, etc.</p>

<p>It’s ok to copy the website layout, there’s nothing wrong with that as long as you write your own content and you do your own code. You can also add some features to improve the site,  change the color and typography. If they appear to be too much similar, make some changes. Also, do not just rely on one website design, you can always look for other similar designs and see what you can apply to your website. Use everything that inspires you, build on it and soon you will have something inspiring to the audience.</p>

<p>Yes, it's illegal for you to use the another websites design but the main purpose is to write you own code for the site and Of course the content should be different and creative.</p>

<p>There is millions of websites copying others design and in most cases copying "Content" too (happened to me personally) :)</p>
