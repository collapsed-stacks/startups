<p>I'm setting up my own private limited company for contracting purposes and I'm confused by the Statement of Capital section where it asks for the Total number of shares issued, aggregate value and "Total aggregate amount unpaid".</p>

<p><strong>What do I put for the 'Total aggregate amount unpaid' part?</strong> </p>

<p>Let's say I have one share of value 1GBP. If I say that the "Total aggregate amount unpaid" is 0, then I am claiming that the share is paid for, although I have not paid for anything. Obviously, it allows me to do this, but what does that actually mean? If I claim that the unpaid amount is 1GBP, then the share is unpaid and would have to be paid, I presume, if I ever shut the company down. But paid to whom? Does anyone have any good advice on how to complete this section?</p>
