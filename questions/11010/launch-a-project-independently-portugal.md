I have a web project completed in terms of development. The project is about crowdsourcing and one the key factors is the community building. So, basically I can launch the project independently, but I am afraid about traction. I need to solve the chicken egg problem, and for that I think I need to have some support. 

I don't need money, just the access to online media, online distribution channels, google ads, facebook ads, and so on.

The problem is that in my country (Portugal) entrepreneurships are basically contests, and more contests, media show off, institutional investors, a long and dark process. 

And well, I just need help with promotion. I don't need office, I don't need employees or more development. Just help with promotion, maybe a media partner. 

Should I risk launch the app only using targeting blogs, reddit, forums, SEO? I'm thinking seriously about this option.

That's nonsense. The only thing you need is customers. Even in Portugal.

No, you need to get your act together and reach out to customers. For all you know you might not even have a product market fit at this stage _because you haven't been talking to your end-users_. You've done this so rarely that you don't even know where to find them. Go out there and find them, see if your product could work, sell. Sales will follow if your product solves their problems.

Pointless at your stage. Go to meetups and events to meet end users, cold email and cold call end-users, do door to door in office buildings, ask people in the street what they think for all you care, what have you. Point is: get. in. front. of. end-users. You. Not a form. Not a VA. Not a consultant. You. The only way you'll ever discover whether your product is useful or not is first hand, straight from the horse's mouth. So go out there and ask.

Once you have the product figured out, as in you've a proven and repeatable sales process, and tried and tested sales arguments that chime in a delightful way in your target audience's ears, _then_ head to blogs, Reddit, forums, SEO, AdWords, Quora, etc. You _can_ do it before, but you'll get the best bang for your buck/time if you learn what messages work first.

(Actually, steering AdWords traffic to a contact form is a pretty cool way to get in front of end-users too, but it requires a budget. Also look at erlibird.com and similar sites if you have one.)
