I have a good idea to make some fundamental software.
I am actually working on software part and I need someone who is very good at electronics design(hardware oriented). 
I am able to do it but I don't have time at present and also it would delay the process of research and development. 

This is a brand new area and I am looking for partners and funding plan.
What shall I do so I can get initial funding?
What shall I do so I can get partners?
How much does it cost to register a tech company in United States?

To register a company, you can check out the secretary of state's website in whatever state you are in and you can register for an LLC and other forms of companies. 

Now to find a partner, you have to find someone you know and trust very well. A friend perhaps and someone who can give you honest feedback and is willing to help out with your business. It may take some looking, but see if you have a friend who'd be interested in helping you out or who is wanting to start a business, that way, you can offer them to help with your business.

Finally, funding may not be the easiest thing. One thing you could do is bootstrap, literally just starting a business and earning money that way, and that way, you owe nothing. Another option you have is looking for angel investors, or people who would be willing to invest in your business with a return of something, be it money, or ownership in the company.

With that, I'll also throw in some nice resources:

For angel investors: https://gust.com (looks like a neat and easy platform)

Hopefully this helps a bit on your journey to start a startup. Good luck!

Taking a bit of a leap, guessing that the state of incorporation would be Delaware with a foreign corporation being where your partner resides/works, likely the Bay Area for fund raising reasons. As for finding a partner in the Bay Area, you might try asking/finding contacts in Shanghai, an expat in Shanghai willing to go back ("[I ‚ù§ Shanghai](http://www.iloveshanghailounge.com/)") to the states to help launch the startup, try to get into a [Ycombinator](https://www.ycombinator.com) and look for one, or [insert pure madness].

It depends on the type of product but crowd funding may be an alternative source. e.g. https://www.kickstarter.com/ or https://www.indiegogo.com/ particularly if the idea isn't ready for angel funding or Y Combinator.
