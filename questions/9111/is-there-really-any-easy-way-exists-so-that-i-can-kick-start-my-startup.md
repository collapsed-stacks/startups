<p>If the startup is not taking off, it means that either the idea don't have a market, or you are not doing your growth properly.</p>

<p>The choice between pivot or persevere is always there. However, if you are pivoting too many times in the initial stage itself, then there is a very serious problem with your market research or your product fit; which you went to reconsider.</p>

<p>There isn't really enough information for someone to help you find a direction to focus your attention. When you say "months of work" it is very vague.</p>

<p>Is there a specific area that you think you are failing at? Have you done the proper preparation to run a software startup? Have you been focused on learning or just "doing"?</p>

<p>Without any information about your experience my advice would be to use the lean startup methodology to do extensive customer development, through in-person customer interviews. Then use what you learn to shape the product you build and how you market and sell it.</p>

<p>The main job of a startup founder is to learn constantly. That means everything including (but not limited to) reading all the right books, learning from your customers by speaking to them in person, running tests to invalidate assumptions about your business, learning how to manage a team, learning how to be more productive in your daily life...</p>

<p>It really never stops. With that said I would like to sincerely wish you luck!</p>

<p>"If it was easy the everyone would be doing it"</p>
