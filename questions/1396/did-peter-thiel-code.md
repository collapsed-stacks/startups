In a lot of places Peter Thiel emphasizes the value of engineers over business people for a startup company. He is a Philosophy and Law graduate. 

Did he code? Did he do any of the engineering of Paypal?

Having been a member of two startups that had great developers and no good marketing or business planning I see this as a subjective thing.

You most likely need to have both - great technical staff and great marketing or lots of luck.

We developed fantastic products.  But it went nowhere.

So, what you need is a well-rounded team. 

It is probably easier finding help in the marketing and business side, or from accelerators or VC or incubators, so I do tend to have a bias, but outstanding developers alone will not get you anywhere other than a neat, shiny product.
