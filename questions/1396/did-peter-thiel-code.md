<p>In a lot of places Peter Thiel emphasizes the value of engineers over business people for a startup company. He is a Philosophy and Law graduate. </p>

<p>Did he code? Did he do any of the engineering of Paypal?</p>

<p>Having been a member of two startups that had great developers and no good marketing or business planning I see this as a subjective thing.</p>

<p>You most likely need to have both - great technical staff and great marketing or lots of luck.</p>

<p>We developed fantastic products.  But it went nowhere.</p>

<p>So, what you need is a well-rounded team. </p>

<p>It is probably easier finding help in the marketing and business side, or from accelerators or VC or incubators, so I do tend to have a bias, but outstanding developers alone will not get you anywhere other than a neat, shiny product.  </p>
