What's the best way to meet skilled and motivated technical people? In other words, where can I solicit my idea and try to get others to collaborate on it with me?

I would use Meetup.com. 
This site is a forum where you can meet up with others in your vicinity. People actually show up to a meetup! it's actual, not virtual. I suppose there is no reason you wouldn't be allowed to setup a virtual forum from there, once you establish a meetup group. Ideally, you would meet face to face though. That's the meetup concept.

I have yet to find a subject where I have been unable to find other 'Like minded people' in my immediate area. You may go the site and start by doing a search on your subject using the built in search engine. If the subject does not exist in your search area, widen the distance to a reasonable driving distance. Remember, folks do usually have to drive home after the meetup unless it is an overnight venue. No meetup on your subject in your area? Start your own meetup so when others interested in your subject matter search, you will be found.

You will need:
- A physical place to hold your meetup
- Appropriate seating: I've seen everything from office formal to bean bags. For skiing and hiking members are on their own for seating arrangements. ;-)
- Support materials: Although you can just all talk if that's what you as a group leader decide that's how your group will function.
- Refreshments are optional but a nice touch. The majority I have been to have none and are just fine.
- Starting time, ending time and location must be posted.

IMHO, A fun, positive attitude is key to successfully starting, running, maintaining and growing a group.

<p>Try <a href="https://www.cofounderslab.com/" rel="nofollow">cofounderslab</a>.  They match technical founders with business side founders and you can search by region, experience, etc. They frequently have free meetups in various cities where you can pitch your idea to potential cofounders.</p>
