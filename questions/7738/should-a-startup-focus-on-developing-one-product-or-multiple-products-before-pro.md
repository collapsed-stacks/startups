## Should a startup focus on developing one product or multiple products before product-market fit?

So the problem is if you focus on a single project and hit a hard wall and you try to go around it, there might not be a path out and you might be stuck forever. But we do hear stories about people selling their startups cause its not working and 1 week later it grows 10 times. 

What is the best way to approach this? Should a startup build multiple products and see which one the customers like better/has better potential/is taking of. Or should a startup stick with a single product and a single vision and ride it until they have to pivot?

If you try to build multiple products at the time with a small team, there's a good chance you'll end up spreading yourself too thin and not ship _anything_.

It depends on whether you're talking products as in variations of a single product line, or independent product lines. Stories abound of startups going under because a successful product line was destroyed by the team and resources being spread too thin on launching too many new, minimally-related product lines.

On the other hand, offering a careful and moderate selection of variations on a single product line can help expand your market for minimal capital/resource expenditure.

<p>I would echo with Denis's answer. </p>

<p>Product or market fit can only be determined after successful <a href="http://leanstack.com/how-we-use-lean-stack-for-innovation-accounting/" rel="nofollow">Innovation Accounting</a> through multiple iterations of the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop.</p>

<p>That is a <a href="http://steveblank.com/2015/05/06/build-measure-learn-throw-things-against-the-wall-and-see-if-they-work/" rel="nofollow">huge amount of work and efforts</a> for the entire team. So, using those efforts on a single product would help the startup in taking better pivot or persevere decisions.</p>

<p>So, if you have multiple products going on in the startup, then the effort is doubled, on the same team. So, it would be extra pressure and diverting focus.</p>
