I have a Delaware C-Corp

I want to raise one million Euros in an equity round at a X million Euros valuation. (European investors don't like convertible notes... No matter the amount, so it has to be an equity round)

Is that even possible ? Can I legally have a price per share written in a non-US currency ?

Thanks !

> Can I legally have a price per share written in a non-US currency?

You can trade your shares for dollars, euros, or even potatoes if you'd like -- it doesn't matter. What matters is you sell them for the market value and that you convert the value to USD on any filing with the IRS.

The State of Delaware does not track how much you got for your shares. They only track the (mostly-meaningless) par value per share, and how many shares your corporation has the right to issue.
