<p>I have a Delaware C-Corp</p>

<p>I want to raise one million Euros in an equity round at a X million Euros valuation. (European investors don't like convertible notes... No matter the amount, so it has to be an equity round)</p>

<p>Is that even possible ? Can I legally have a price per share written in a non-US currency ?</p>

<p>Thanks !</p>

<p>You can trade your shares for dollars, euros, or even potatoes if you'd like -- it doesn't matter. What matters is you sell them for the market value and that you convert the value to USD on any filing with the IRS.</p>

<p>The State of Delaware does not track how much you got for your shares. They only track the (mostly-meaningless) par value per share, and how many shares your corporation has the right to issue.</p>

<p><strong>I am not a lawyer. This is not legal advice.</strong></p>
