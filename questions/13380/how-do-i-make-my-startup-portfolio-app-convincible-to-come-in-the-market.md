I am creating a startup portfolio app where various startup of my countries will be listed. Its a domestic app as I have no clear idea for globalising and the concept is also not so wide for now. I have already completed portfolio part where the tables/entities are 

    Company, Product, Achievements, Founder  (you can help me to add more if you have an idea)

Now that I have completed the portfolio part, I want hiring part too which, I believe, will benefit both startups and endusers who are seeking for the job so having this feature will pull startups to list in my app 

For hiring entities, what I have come up with is the following data

**Job Hiring Model**

    Company Name
    
    Job Title 
    
    Category 
    
    Description 
    
    Location 
    
    Position -> Employee, Intern, Temporary, Freelance 
    
    TeleCommute 
    
    Work Schedule 
    
    Estimated Salary 
    
    Website 
    
    Job Application Email 
    
    Company Email 
    
    Stack Needed


The focus in only on the startups. One more idea beside hiring feature is `pitch your idea to the investors`. I am in favor of minimum viable product but saying that just listing company feature won't convince startups, I think. So, how do I go in the market so startups will feel that they should really use this app?
