<p>My company purchased a vehicle to help promote the business.  It's being wrapped with company branding.  The purchase cost went into a "Vehicle" expense category in QuickBooks.  My question is, how should the expenses related to the upkeep &amp; maintenance of the vehicle, as was as cosmetic effects, such as paint/graphics, be accounted?  For example, should I make a sub-category under Marketing, lump everything in the new Vehicle category, or something else?</p>

<p>You'll want to ask your accountant, because the threshold and the amortization period depend on the country (and possibly state if you're in the US).</p>

<p>In essence, though, there's a threshold beyond which you must treat an expense as an investment that you then amortize over a time period.</p>

<p>Most likely, you'll want to book the total acquisition cost as an investment and amortize the latter over a few years, and book the operating costs (i.e. fuel, maintenance, etc.) as expenses.</p>
