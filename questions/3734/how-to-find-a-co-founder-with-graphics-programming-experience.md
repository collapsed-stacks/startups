I'm looking to find graphics programmers able to implement a spatial browser UI either in a browser using famo.us and javasript or WebGL and C# or OpenGL and C#.  The added difficulty lies in the fact that this is a co-founder position opening for sweat equity (up to 45%).  A little background about the technology:

 - XUI lets users browse in parallel through two channels of moving
   image content at the same time.  
   
   XUI means to address the big picture problem of browsing through
   thousands of image search results.
   
   XUI lets users see more in less time.  This translates into the
   ability the capture more transactions for content providers -
   transactions can be "impulse buying", CTRs, ad views or traffic
   referral.

So how can I find someone with this kind of a talent?

Advertise for a suitable person on whatever startups/co-founders job board /website is most appropriate for your geographic region. Google should be able to help you find one.

That person is going to want to know what it is that you bring to the party - if the startup is not yet funded, you don't have any unique IP, and the technology doesn't yet exist (you want them to create it), then they're going to want to know how you add value, i.e. why they would do the project with you rather than just doing it by themselves.
