You appear to be trying to establish a viable consulting services company where you provide mobile application development (design, coding, user experience, etc.).

If you have not done so already, you may want to work with/for another established company in your field to help understand all the services you need to provide and how to approach customers. 

A freelance or single-person consulting company is hard to establish. Try approaching companies in your geographic area that are in the Mobile Application Development business and see if you can get a job with them (to gain more experience, customer exposure and to see how they operate.

As mentioned in the comments, your question is really too broad. But I'll take a try at helping you out a bit.

First, based on the grammar in your question, I'm guessing English isn't your first language. So if you're trying to sell primarily in English speaking countries like the US and UK, your English could be giving potential customer a less than positive first impression. 

Another guess, is that you are a skilled technical person. And that doesn't alway go along with being a skilled salesperson. I have to work very hard at that myself.

There is training available for both of those areas. And I'd also suggest that find a partner to do the sales end of the business.

I really hope you find this helpful. And please forgive me if I offended you in any  way.
