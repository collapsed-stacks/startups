<p>I am programming a game that I am hoping to turn a profit on. To achieve this I have come to the conclusion that I will need a business. I live in the state of Michigan, U.S.A. What process would I have to go through to claim ownership over a company name? How much does it cost?</p>

<p>There's a great site I found a year or so ago that provides steps for every state as well as filing fees, mandatory annual actions, and other things.</p>

<p>Specifically for Michigan: <a href="http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/michigan-form-llc-31760.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/michigan-form-llc-31760.html</a></p>

<p>I quoted the major parts here but please visit their site as it has all the information. I've read through this specific state's info previously (as it's where I live) and I plan on following this same process myself in a few months.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>Choose a Name for Your LLC:
  Under Michigan law, an LLC name must contain the words "Limited Liability Company" or the abbreviations "L.L.C." or "LLC."
  Your LLCâ€™s name must be distinguishable from the names of other business entities already on file with the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs. ...</li>
  <li>File Articles of Organization:
  A Michigan LLC is created by filing Articles of Organization with the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs Bureau of Commercial Services. ... The filing fee is $50.</li>
  <li>Appoint a Registered Agent:
  Every Michigan LLC must have an agent for service of process in the state. ... The registered agent must have a physical street address in Michigan.</li>
  <li>Prepare an Operating Agreement:
  An LLC operating agreement is not required in Michigan, but is highly advisable. ...</li>
  <li>...</li>
  <li>Comply With Other Tax and Regulatory Requirements ...</li>
  <li>File Annual Statements:
  All LLCs doing business in Michigan must file an annual statement with the Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs. ... The filing fee is $25.</li>
  <li>...</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>So in total, 75$ in filling fees and 25$ annually.</p>

<p>You will also need some address that can be served legal papers in case you are sued and you must be comfortable with it being public knowledge as anyone can then find it when searching for your business listing on Michigan's website. It has to be a physical location (like a house or office, not a postal box) but I've seen some that aren't so I assume that's technically not legal.</p>

<p>Also, as Cromian said, a Trademark would help in protecting your company name from other people who would like to use it.</p>

<p>But remember, I am not a lawyer. Plenty of people do this stuff but if you're ever unsure about something major, you should contact a lawyer.</p>

<p>To register a business you can either use a service like LegalZoom. Or go through the respective State Agency <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/business" rel="nofollow">Business One Stop</a>. Cost depends on the type of business and the set laws in place.</p>

<p>Keep in mind, this will still allow other people in other states to still use that name.</p>

<p>To protect the name so no one else legally can use it, you will need to file for <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/trademarks/basics/BasicFacts.pdf" rel="nofollow">trademark</a>.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
