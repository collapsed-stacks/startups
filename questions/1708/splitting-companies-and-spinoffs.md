Considering a company created 2 products from a core technology targeting different segments using different products and different founders wants to focus only on one of them.

How does the process of splitting the company and spinoff work? Who gets to keep what percentage of ownership in which company? What about the investors?

If you're looking for an example you could look into HP Inc. split-up. One focusing on Personal computers the other focusing on server machines.

Or Sony Ericsson (the patents game)

Search them up, you'll get a lot of results to how and when in detail.
