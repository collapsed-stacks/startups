All the apps in the store are made by third party people. Why don't they make their own apps? 

There are lots of other companies like these which don't have an app of their own.

<p>Reddit has an interesting history with mobile apps. They created an official app, <a href="http://www.redditblog.com/2009/01/i-read-it-on-ireddit-official-reddit.html" rel="nofollow">iReddit</a> in 2009. It wasn't very popular so they deprecated it and recommended users to use a third party app or the mobile site.</p>

<p>Making an app costs money and involves technologies that the development team probably isn't familiar with. It's more profitable to focus on improving their core product. When asked about reddit's lack of a mobile app, and admin <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1u9uqa/eli5_why_isnt_there_an_official_reddit_app/ceg6vv1" rel="nofollow">said</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our reasoning is that instead of putting time and effort into our own app, we'd rather work on providing an environment that enables other awesome app developers to build apps.
  Can't say that won't change in the future, but it has been our guiding principle over the past few years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Eventually they <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/10/15/reddit-acquires-alien-blue-the-most-popular-unofficial-reddit-app/" rel="nofollow">bought Alien Blue</a>, one of the most popular reddit apps and made it their official version.</p>

<p>Mobile apps are nice to have but not critical for many sites. Reddit, Craigslist and Stack Exchange were able to do very well without having their own official app but allowing third party developers to make one. Reddit and Stack Exchange both have an official app now, and maybe Craigslist will get one eventually, but it isn't a necessity and it costs a lot of money, which not all startups have.</p>
