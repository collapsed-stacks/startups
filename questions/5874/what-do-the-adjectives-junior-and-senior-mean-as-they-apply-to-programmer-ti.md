<p>For example, what should I expect from a "Senior Ruby Developer" that's different from what I should expect from a "Junior Ruby Developer" or just a plain old "Ruby Developer?" Are the distinctions standardized? Like with a test or a certificate or something?</p>

<p>No, as far as I know, these job adjectives are in <strong>no way standardized</strong>.</p>

<p>But I would argue that there's a <strong>common understanding</strong> in the software industry: these job title adjectives usually reflect the experience a developer has and the difficulty of tasks an employer expects a <strong>Senior</strong> or <strong>Junior</strong> to solve.</p>

<p>A <strong>Junior Developer</strong> typically solves smaller problems (probably with the guidance of a Senior Developer or an Architect) and isn't expected to design the architecture of a whole app.</p>

<p>A <strong>Senior Developer</strong> usually tackles larger, more complex problems, should be faster due to his experience and might be in charge of mentoring younger developers.</p>
