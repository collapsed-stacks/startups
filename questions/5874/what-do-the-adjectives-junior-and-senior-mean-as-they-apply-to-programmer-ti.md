For example, what should I expect from a "Senior Ruby Developer" that's different from what I should expect from a "Junior Ruby Developer" or just a plain old "Ruby Developer?" Are the distinctions standardized? Like with a test or a certificate or something?

No, as far as I know, these job adjectives are in **no way standardized**.

But I would argue that there's a **common understanding** in the software industry: these job title adjectives usually reflect the experience a developer has and the difficulty of tasks an employer expects a **Senior** or **Junior** to solve.

A **Junior Developer** typically solves smaller problems (probably with the guidance of a Senior Developer or an Architect) and isn't expected to design the architecture of a whole app.

A **Senior Developer** usually tackles larger, more complex problems, should be faster due to his experience and might be in charge of mentoring younger developers.
