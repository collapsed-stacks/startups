Looking for a fresh look at how to source, staff, and manage tasks on a short-term basis, without long-term liabilities such as payroll.

In an attempt to limit the scope of the question, I'm looking for coders that are able to write custom code remotely with well defined acceptance tests. 

A good answer, per possible solution, will cover how issues related to taxes, legal agreements, and IP might be addressed.

(Please note that if you haven't sourced at least 2000 hours in a way that relates to this answer, then it very possible you lack the experience to provide advice of this topic.)

<p>Hire them on a (sub)-contract basis. You'll need either a combined agreement or to use a few agreements:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>IP Assignment:</em> The Harvard Business School has a very good <a href="http://www.hbs.edu/entrepreneurship/pdf/IP%20Assignment.pdf" rel="nofollow">example of this</a>. You'll likely want to edit it for your situation. There are definitely others around to look at as well. </li>
<li><em>NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement):</em> Because there is a good chance that you'll be exchanging priviledged information you will definitely need one. There are <strong>many</strong> free samples available - for example <a href="http://www.ndasforfree.com/NDAS/GetEmployee.html" rel="nofollow">this NDA</a> (for that one you'd want to replace all references from Employee to Contractor). </li>
<li>Contract Agreement: Spells out everything else (and may include those two above integrated in or as addendums). Things you'll want to make sure to include on this:
<ul>
<li>Rate (either fixed rate per project or hourly)</li>
<li>What extras they will charge (ie do they charge (sales) taxes)</li>
<li>Insurance: Make it clearly explicit that they are responsible for any insurance requirements in their jurisdiction/course of business.</li>
<li>What both of your responsibilities are (ie notice etc.)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>This is a fairly complicated agreement/collection of agreements; most people should at least have a lawyer review their proposed agreements (cheaper) or have a lawyer draw up the agreement. Even with an agreement in <em>some</em> jurisdictions you may be liable for insurance or other requirements; for example for <em>construction</em> (due to being a <strong>high</strong> risk industry) work in British Colombia (Canada) if you are subcontracting you are required to ensure that your subs are paying Workers Compensation or pay Workers Compensation yourself and deduct it from their pay. Most provinces/states have a business information service that can give you basic information like that for free as is relevant to your jurisdiction.</p>

<p>In terms of payroll type taxes you have no liability as long as it is explicitly stated in your agreement that they are working on a <em>contract-basis</em> and for good measure add in something like "the contractor is responsible for all taxes on the income from this contract".</p>

<p>Another option is to go through a freelancer agency (or similar) that you pay the agency and they <em>may</em> already have a pretty good contract.</p>
