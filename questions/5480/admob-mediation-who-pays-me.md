I've started using admob mediation for monitizaion my mobile app.
I've used before Facebook Audiences as my ad provider. now I use a combination of admob and with mediating Facebook Audience.

Now that, after the change, I noticed that while income on admob dashboard increases it decreases on facebook. I am still serving ads from Facebook (I see them in my app). Question is, who's paying me? Is it Facebook paying google and then google paying me? Or does it go directly from Facebook to me? Or am I just missing out something here?
