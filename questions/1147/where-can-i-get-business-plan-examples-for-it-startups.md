I am looking for real examples which passed the filter of seed capital investors, not business plan tutorials, templates or artificial examples. Can anyone help with that?

If you are seriously interested in those sorts of presentations consider doing your research on a few smaller VCs or business owners who have gone through the VC process. Learn about them, what they do, who they invest in, and send them a short email explaining your situation (budding business owner wanting to impress?). Request a sample pitch they've used or seen. If you're professional, lucky, and persistent one might throw you a bone and send you what you're looking for.

Who knows, you might even develop a mentor or a friend who could give you a few tips worth more than the business plans you were looking for in the first place.

Good luck!
