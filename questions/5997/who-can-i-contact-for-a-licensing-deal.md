I have a patented product I want to license. I have some companies in mind but how can I contact them about my product? I was thinking of just emailing them because calling would lead into a hassle. If I do email their company, which department or who should I email?

If you're contacting a bigger company odds are you're not the first one to license a product to them. Telling the operator that you have a product and you're looking to make a licensing deal will most probably prompt her to put you trough to the person you need to talk to.

In most cases the person you are trying to talk to is the marketing manager of a product line that would easily understand your invention. For example if you're invention is a self-folding shovel, you'd like to talk to the marketing manager of the gardening department.

You could try emailing the companies on their public email address as well and ask for the address of the respective person with whom you can negotiate your licensing deal.
