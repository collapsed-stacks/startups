I have a development service based agency. We have been operating for last 2-3 years and most of our clients came from my freelancing career. We provide iOS apps development, Android apps development, Web development, Games development and Designing (2d & 3d) services.

Is there is a better way to find customers for development services other than freelancing and networking?

"Best way" is subjective and really depends on multiple factors (business, location..). Here are 2 good ways to get customers for a B2B client business:

**Search Advertising**

You may advertise to potential customers based on keywords on `Google Search` (Adwords), `Bing search`, etc. Advertising will lead to a PPC (pay per click cost) which means that you would have to pay when someone clicks on your ad to follow and land on your website. After that person lands on your website you have to make sure it is enticing enough to grab his attention so that he turns into a client.

- Pros: You will get more traffic to your website that you can convert to clients

- Cons: If conversion rate of traffic to customers is low you will end up paying more for advertisements than the money you make from clients.

**Your exiting client network**

If you currently have or had clients in past that have been pleased with your work then you could ask them for referrals to other potential customers:

- Pros: Customers will have higher confidence in your work because of the referral; you have less marketing/convincing to do.
- Cons: Hard to have differential pricing since clients you get from your network would likely want a similar pricing that you gave to his friend/colleague who referred you to them.

Abdul,

to achieve new sales you should build the following:

1) Find strong positioning and niche for your agency (think about UTP - unique trade proposal for the client). To do that try to understand your strong and weak sides of the business. They could be very narrow, like knowledge in particular industry or ability go give some spesific guarantees;

2) Build a strong lead generation (active sales) process via inhouse staff or outsourcced agency;

3) develop inbound strategy via content: write free open stack libraries, plugins and try to promote them, write articles and give insights in developers' comunity;

And stay tuned!
