I am a software developer and I am before to release a community app. I see how important is to convince people on Facebook, talk about my product, chat with them, mouth advertisement, talk before public about my product to get first users. But I do not have time for it and I am a programmer. 

What sort of company should I look for who deal with this kind of task?

I can see that if I do no marketing I can get users from App Store, ~5-20 per day, who downloads check out new apps. If I hire a company dealing with marketing, then they will bring much more users to the board. I think a company like this can be paid on a performance basis. 

What do you think how much a new user can cost?

I have built massive followings (in the millions) through Facebook at no cost for different businesses I have owned in the past.  I have also been paid $1-3 per user acquisition to help others build their social media followings.  User acquisition for an app may be slightly higher since it takes a little more work than just having a user click like.  However, you should be able to get 100+ users in the first couple of days just through your own network for free.  Then ask 10 good friends to help you spread the word.  That should put you at a couple hundred followers.  Then I would imagine 5% may download the app (i'm just guessing).

However, the problem with Facebook is that not everyone is within your target audience.  Your best bet is to figure out who your target audience and then find forums with the hardcore users.  If it is a running app for example, then find every running forum and let people know about your app and possibly offer the paid version for free for a limited time to particular forums to get the buzz going.  This is how I have generated the best customer conversion rates and it really doesn't take that long.  So don't waste your time with Facebook in my opinion....go after your target audie
