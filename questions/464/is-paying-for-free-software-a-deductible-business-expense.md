<p>I'm using some free software that I'd like to support.  Its developer does not have 501(c)(3) status.  If I supported the developer out of personal funds, the contribution would not be tax-deductible.  Unlike paid commercial software, if I paid out of business funds, it wouldn't be a deductible business expense either, right?</p>

<p>I could try to put the amount as an expense under the category of the equivalent commercial software, but I don't think this is legitimate.</p>

<p>Now if I asked the developer for a trivial amount of support and he sent me a bill for the support, in the amount of the desired contribution, I'd be fine, right?</p>

<p>I believe your reasoning is correct. </p>

<p>In fact, many opensource developers do offer support services (partially precisely for this reason) - basically as long as the business has received some benefit in consideration for the expenses paid (for instance, <em>readiness</em> to provide support, priority in being responded, guarantee that your emails would be read, etc) - which the business would in turn use to increase revenue.. it would be a business expense.</p>

<p>(Mind you, most of my experience is UK based, IANAL, etc.) </p>

<p>Different taxation departments can be different in terms of stringency.</p>

<p>From my dealings with the CRA (Canada Revenue Agency), you could probably claim that in Canada. Basically the question would be 'is it a reasonable expenditure?' You might have to argue it but saying that you need to make sure that x software will be available when you upgrade to version x and this expenditure helps ensure that. <em>Most</em> of the reviewers would just accept that. Yes some might not and once a decision has been made re-reviewing can be chancy. </p>

<p>However the negative is very minimal; one discrepancy and they'll just minorly adjust your taxes to factor out that - usually with no penalty except for the interest on the now due amount. One semi-questionable entry also will not get flags put on to your account; it basically requires a pattern of questionable expenses that are a <strong>lot</strong> more questionable than that.</p>

<p>So that boils down to:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>If you can easily get a receipt from the developer:</em> (saying pretty much anything - i.e. even a paypal receipt should work fine if it at leasts references the software name and your business name) you can claim it with surety. </li>
<li><em>If you can't get a receipt for some odd reason:</em> If you have it in your accounts you are probably safe to claim it but <strong>if it did get reviewed</strong> you'd have to explain it which depending on your jurisdiction <strong>could be problematic or not</strong>.</li>
</ul>
