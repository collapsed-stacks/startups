<p>My company is registered in the state of Pennsylvania in the US and I plan to open a Post Office box for my company in the state of New York.</p>

<p>Will this count as physical presence in New York for the purposes of taxes?</p>

<p>I believe that it takes more than a simple PO Box to qualify for the NY Tax rates. It appears the NY goal is to generate revenue via the individuals brought in/employed by start-ups.</p>

<p>This is a difficult question to answer. Having the P.O. box alone would <em>probably</em> not be sufficient to constitute an in-state physical presence, but the box in conjunction with a lot of business done in New York might be.</p>

<p>You'd have to do arguably-extensive research into New York case-law to really come to a conclusive answer on that. It's a fairly subjective matter, law, so it's hard to say, but your best bet might be to speak with an attorney, or even perhaps a tax accountant with specific experience with New York laws.</p>
