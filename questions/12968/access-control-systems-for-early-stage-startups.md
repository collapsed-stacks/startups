We're an early-stage FinTech startup trying to figure out how we can affordably deal with both information security and physical security concerns. In this question, I'm specifically asking about physical security controls - we need to have this covered soon.

One of my colleagues who was at Managed by Q suggested we use Kisi, but it seems kind of pricey given we're only 15 people. Of course, there's always ADP and Protection1, but they seem a little too enterprise-y for our small startup.

Is there a best practice?

Thanks in advance for the feedback and advice.
