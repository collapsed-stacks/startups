I d like to put a website online and start earning money with it. 
The website is about a very specific area in engineering: development of nanosatellites

There are no websites teaching how to develop your own nanosatellites. However there are a bunch of websites selling all the equipment to build one.
So proposing those online shops some adspace (and/or mentionings in the articles I write on my website) in exchange for some money could be interesting.


- how does this kind of things usually work? Do people pay monthly for some space? How much usually?

- What would be a good way to propose this to these shops? Because I think they would never just start paying some money to some unknown guy living on another continent... 

Side question: what are some good tips to gain thrust?

Any other tips and critics are welcomep

I think you first need to promote your site/yourself so that you can have adequate traffic and user base. You can start writing blog/Tips and how to do articles in order to gain traffic and users. Once you have good traffic start selling premium contents like How to Videos or Ebooks. Also at that time, you can target the shops for the Ads. You will let them show their ads on your site and in return they will pay you a commission for the lead/sale they will made through this. This is something we call Affiliate System in IT world.

You have nice idea but I never heard that somebody monetized their website simply by putting it online. There's rules to this:

1- start publishing useful content on your website
2- share it on the web/peer websites or anywhere related, so you can attract visitors and comments/requests
3- monetize opportunities will show up here

As for pricing your services which is adspace or mentions for those stores, I recommend to categorize your services at first e.g. if you buy mentions we charge you X, if you buy banners we charge you Y. And test different pricings until you find the right model for your website. For now, I think a minimum of 2 USD$ per week can be fine. 

* yes, people will pay you if you the value proposition is good enough.
* focus on your offer. business and shopping in general is not about where do you live, it's about what can you do for me. put benefits in your offer.
* the simplest explanation of how it works is: they send you their graphic files/articles (which is their advertisement picture that they want you to put on the site), you place it on respective place. If they don't have, it can be one of your services ;-)

If you want to dig deeper in this topic and explore a new world you will love, I suggest to read about 'customer development methodology'.
