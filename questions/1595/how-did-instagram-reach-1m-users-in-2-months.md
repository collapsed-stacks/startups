From the interviews of Kevin Systrom(founder of instagram) he always seems to skip the part where he talks about his marketing techniques. 
It clearly is not word of mouth. Well then what is it? What did he do to market it so well?

<p>I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPigMKugJhY" rel="nofollow">this video</a> from Kevin Rose's Foundation series a while back. </p>

<p>If I can remember correctly from the interview, they had made email lists of a lot of people in the tech industry.  The day the app came out (and possibly when earlier beta versions came out?) they sent emails to everyone on the list announcing the release.</p>
