<p>There can be lots of things</p>

<ul>
<li>Contingency fund (very much needed if you are small)</li>
<li>Creating Talent Pipeline (University or community relationship)</li>
<li>Increasing the perks for the betterment of team's productivity (Better tools, Library, lunch, etc)</li>
<li>Social Responsibility </li>
</ul>

<p>List can go on. It depends what's your long term goal about your venture. If you are looking for building a meaningful organization, you should think beyond profit &amp; loss from the start.</p>

<p>Also, it would have been bit easy to answer your question had you mention you domain :-)</p>

<p><strong>1. Invest in Other Things</strong> </p>

<p>-Invest in a mutual fund, a startup, the stock-market, a fund, etc. Have your cash grow. When you need it, sell. </p>

<p><strong>2. Save It</strong></p>

<p>-Apple has $200B+ in cash. That gives them over millions and billions of time to invest into things, fail miserably, and try again without making a <em>dent</em> in their current projects. Safest option. </p>

<p><strong>3. Start a Spinoff or a New Company</strong> </p>

<p>-Start another startup that you and your partners have always wanted to build but don't have the time. Hire <strong>A</strong> players. Have them run the show.
(Only always hire A players)</p>

<p><strong>4. Lobbying</strong></p>

<p>-Depends on the industry, but you can use that money for lobbying: from politics to certain functions and programs you may need from your suppliers- even if it's software: special API access to Facebook's API if you invest $10 million. Be creative.</p>

<p><strong>5. Be Self Sustainable</strong> </p>

<p>-Make yourself less dependent on your suppliers. SpaceX saves <strong>hundreds of millions</strong> a year, manufactures, builds, welds, and fires off rockets into space for a <strong>fraction</strong> that it's competitors do (Lockheed Martin, Boeing, &amp; friends) because they make almost everything themselves, in America. </p>

<p><strong>6. Family Stock Options</strong></p>

<p>-You'll never know when your kids will take over. Involve in the family.</p>
