There can be lots of things

 - Contingency fund (very much needed if you are small)
 - Creating Talent Pipeline (University or community relationship)
 - Increasing the perks for the betterment of team's productivity (Better tools, Library, lunch, etc)
 - Social Responsibility 

List can go on. It depends what's your long term goal about your venture. If you are looking for building a meaningful organization, you should think beyond profit & loss from the start.

Also, it would have been bit easy to answer your question had you mention you domain :-)

**1. Invest in Other Things** 

-Invest in a mutual fund, a startup, the stock-market, a fund, etc. Have your cash grow. When you need it, sell. 

**2. Save It**
 
-Apple has $200B+ in cash. That gives them over millions and billions of time to invest into things, fail miserably, and try again without making a *dent* in their current projects. Safest option. 

**3. Start a Spinoff or a New Company** 

-Start another startup that you and your partners have always wanted to build but don't have the time. Hire **A** players. Have them run the show.
(Only always hire A players)

**4. Lobbying**

-Depends on the industry, but you can use that money for lobbying: from politics to certain functions and programs you may need from your suppliers- even if it's software: special API access to Facebook's API if you invest $10 million. Be creative.

**5. Be Self Sustainable** 

-Make yourself less dependent on your suppliers. SpaceX saves **hundreds of millions** a year, manufactures, builds, welds, and fires off rockets into space for a **fraction** that it's competitors do (Lockheed Martin, Boeing, & friends) because they make almost everything themselves, in America. 

**6. Family Stock Options**

-You'll never know when your kids will take over. Involve in the family.
