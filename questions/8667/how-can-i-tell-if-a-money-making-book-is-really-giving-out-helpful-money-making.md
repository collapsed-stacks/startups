I've read many money-making books, only to find that the author makes a lot of money when a lot of people buy his book. My question is, how can I tell that a book is really giving out helpful/useful money-making knowledge or just a means to make money for the author?

There's a certain type of money making book that is written in the following way:

 - Author thinks of a way of making money
 - Instead of doing it, he/she writes a book about how to do it
 - Sells the book to make money

And most of these books are titled "How to make money with ..."

Stop reading these books. These are bad books. There's no real insight in them, that's why they are s***.

Start reading books about specific industries or specific topics that you're interested in. I.E. if you're interested in building a startup you should read books about startups.

If you search for books that other great entrepreneurs recommend, you should find plenty.

Reading the autobiographies of your favorite businessmen/women should give you great insight as well.
