<p>I've read many money-making books, only to find that the author makes a lot of money when a lot of people buy his book. My question is, how can I tell that a book is really giving out helpful/useful money-making knowledge or just a means to make money for the author?</p>

<p>There's a certain type of money making book that is written in the following way:</p>

<ul>
<li>Author thinks of a way of making money</li>
<li>Instead of doing it, he/she writes a book about how to do it</li>
<li>Sells the book to make money</li>
</ul>

<p>And most of these books are titled "How to make money with ..."</p>

<p>Stop reading these books. These are bad books. There's no real insight in them, that's why they are s***.</p>

<p>Start reading books about specific industries or specific topics that you're interested in. I.E. if you're interested in building a startup you should read books about startups.</p>

<p>If you search for books that other great entrepreneurs recommend, you should find plenty.</p>

<p>Reading the autobiographies of your favorite businessmen/women should give you great insight as well.</p>
