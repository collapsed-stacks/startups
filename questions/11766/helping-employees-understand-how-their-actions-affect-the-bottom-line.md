I have a small veterinary business and a have a question about motivation.
 
My employees tend to not charge for all services and give a few too many discounts. This obviously lowers income and thus I am struggling to give everyone full hours. 

No one wants their hours cut but they need to understand that their decisions can affect that.

How can I help them to understand this without sounding too cheap or nagging and without making them feel less motivated to work?

Or ... end of year bonuses based on a form of profit sharing ... but of course show them how the profits (or revenues) are directly affected, negatively, by the amount of discounts and other behaviors  (and show them other was it is positively impacted).  Surely there is a monthly "dashboard" or report you can email them that shows the contributions of their actions to the bottom line.

If this is too much transparency for your tastes... then pick a few metrics you can measure for each person - that has both positive and negative impact on your business.  Every month,employee with best numbers gets a bonus, and the ones that consistently have poor performance get fired.

Even better if you can make it a group metric & group reward (this way, they care about the behavior of their co-workers too - not just their own).

Tell them exactly this. 
Call in a meeting, show them the numbers, calculate how much you lose by providing free of charge services and answer their questions.
I understand it and you merely wrote a few lines on the internet, why wouldn't they?
