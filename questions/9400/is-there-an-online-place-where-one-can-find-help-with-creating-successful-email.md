I have a pain: my B2B SaaS product gets about 100-200 signups a month.  Almost noone buys without engaging sales engineering help.  However, I feel that our email sequences designed to engage the signups into a conversation about their needs, completely suck.

Is there a place where such things are discussed and where successful email sequences are shown/rated/analyzed?

TIA

<p>There's a lot of examples and blog posts available, and the term for this area is "Customer Journey".  Also, since a lot of sales funnels are unique to some extent, you might need to try doing A/B testing or something similar to determine what works and what doesn't work for your product and market. (I understand this doesn't directly answer your question, but i don't have enough rep to add as a comment).</p>

<p>Take a look at this <a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/ab-testing-email-campaigns/" rel="nofollow">blog post from Kissmetrics</a> about A/B testing email campaigns (there are many other's like this).  And this blog post about <a href="https://broadek.co.uk/blog/ProcessImprovementWithABTesting" rel="nofollow">A/B testing in general</a>, as they might be helpful.</p>
