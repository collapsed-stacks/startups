I'd like to know what's the difference between fixed price and flat rate? My startup offers unlimited design service. I have 3 pricing plans that are billed monthly. Therefore, no matter how many designs client ask, they only need to pay one price per month. Should I call it fixed price or flat rate? If it's flat rate, should I write flat rates because I have 3 pricing plans? Will appreciate any help. Thanks in advance.

Usually, fixed price means it's not subject to bargaining, and flat rate is used to convey that the charge (or % charged) is the same in all cases.

<p>Although the distinction is largely semantic, there are usage considerations. 
 This <a href="http://budgeting.thenest.com/difference-between-fixed-rate-flat-rate-21160.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this blog link</a> elucidates the point:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Terms like "fixed rate" and "flat rate" can often confuse consumers. In general terms, a fixed rate is an interest rate that applies to a loan, while a flat rate is a method of payment that someone charges. The two terms apply in different situations, with a fixed rate referring specifically to interest rates, and a flat rate referring to the way someone charges for a service."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"Fixed rate" can have usages beyond interest, but based on what you want to use the term for </p>

<ul>
<li>"<strong>Flat Rate</strong>" is the better choice</li>
</ul>
