<p>This product on Aliexpress is blatant that it is a South Park sweater, yet I can almost guarantee the seller does not have permission to sell this brand merchandise. Is permission required?<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vB5gx.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vB5gx.png" alt="South Park Sweater"></a>

<p>Lastly, this classic car rug has to have a design creator.

<p><strong>So is permission from the creator required to sell these kinds of artworks?</strong></p>

<p>"Is permission required" is an interested question. Permission is required to avoid a lawsuit. But there is a low chance that there will be a lawsuit brought by the intellectual property owner (whether it's copyright, trademark, patent, or something else).</p>

<ul>
<li>First, the IP rights owner would need to find out that someone on Aliexpress has sold a few copies of a shirt with their art on it.</li>
<li>Then, the IP rights owner would need to spend money for an attorney to locate the person who infringed their rights, contact them, and start a lawsuit against them. The person doing the infringing may be from a different country, where different laws apply, making it even harder. There's probably a higher chance that the rights owner will just send a "cease and desist" letter and not ask for any money.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, if there is a lawsuit against the person on Aliexpress, it could cost that person a lot of money in legal fees, the little money they made from selling the shirts, and legal "damages". So it is probably not worth the risk.</p>
