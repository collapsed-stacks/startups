I have product startup idea. I'm a programmer and would require a guy from electronics and manufacturing. How do I make sure that they do not steal my idea and launch their own product before mine? 

I think copyright, patenting and IP rights wouldn't help much, because it would be a long and expensive procedure, also I'm running low on funds.

This thought is hindering me from launching my own company and hiring the best people in my startup.

Please help me with some insights. Thanks

If you're ever successful, it won't be because you kept your idea so secret, it will be because your idea spread so well. And if you ever become a great employer, it won't be because you found ways to hog-tie your team, it will be because you found ways to enable them to give their very best work.

Right now, **you're losing momentum because you won't commit**. 

Maybe your idea contains some elements that (a) create extraordinary value; (b) are truly protectable; (c) can be concealed from public view. Then find a pragmatic way to keep those elements out of sight. 

But probably what you have is **an opportunity to help a group of customers you're willing to commit to for the long haul**. If someone copies your idea, so what? They don't have your expertise and passion. If nobody copies your idea, ever, then there's nothing there of value.

A tiny proportion of startups need to protect an invention, and there are ways to do that, mostly very expensive. If you don't have deep pockets, **stop wanting what you can't have and start making waves in your world**.

<p>Have your employee(s) sign a non-compete contract, or include a non-compete clause in their employment contract.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-compete_clause" rel="nofollow noreferrer">From Wikipedia:</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In contract law, a non-compete clause (often NCC), or covenant not to compete (CNC), is a clause under which one party (usually an employee) agrees not to enter into or start a similar profession or trade in competition against another party (usually the employer).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The NCC can also cover a product or design, rather than (or in addition to) a profession or trade.</p>
