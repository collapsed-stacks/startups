How do I as a 50% general partner in a successful small business "sell" my 50%
This was a must do because the significant other could not keep a job. I did all the leg work, I provided some of the start up costs, did all the advertisement, still do all the books and payroll. Here's the kicker since it worked (and he thought it would flip) I am not "allowed" any of the company profit. I don't even get paid for the books payroll picking up parts ECT. I have to work full time just to pay my vehicles and daily living . I am trying to start a sole proprietor of my own, and I figured if I can sell out of this one I'll have the option of making my company work. (Plus he will have to pay the new partner legally since it is not a personal relationship)
