<p>I am in the process of delivering a project, it is design based. The customer has requested that the designer should be present in a meeting to answer questions about the design pieces.</p>

<p>The problem that I have, is that he is not available during the day and can only work evenings. So I am now in a awkward situation where I have to somehow find an excuse of why he is unable to attend over several meetings. We cannot tell the customer that he is a freelancer but is working for us internally.</p>

<p>How do I get out of this situation?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>This is not an awkward situation, but rather quite typical if you work with subcontractors.</p>

<p>The simple answer is: tell the truth. </p>

<p>Explain your customer that your designer cannot be on the meeting at a proposed time. You are free to give more or less explanation. You need to think about your own desired position in this situation and truthfully explain it to all parties. This will show you in a respectful light and as a reliable partner.</p>
