<p>Quoting a <a href="https://startups.stackexchange.com/a/4104/1824">previous answer I gave on this topic</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Start by understanding that <strong>launching your crowdfunding campaign should be your <em>last</em> step in promoting it</strong>; not the first.</p>
  
  <p>As such, <strong>identify the target audience and where it hangs out online <em>before</em> launching</strong> your crowdfunding campaign. This is key. Your entire execution will be a gazillion times more efficient if you do this properly.</p>
  
  <p>Then <strong>build your list <em>before</em> launching</strong>. You want backers lined up and excited before you publish. In practical terms, this means building a landing page to feed a mailing list, and then drum-rolling the crowdfunding campaign by emailing your list when you're about to launch.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You'll find a lot more in it, so I'd advise you to read it in full.</p>

<p>If I were to prioritize pre-campaign activities, they'd be:</p>

<ol>
<li>Research the market, to understand client needs/wants, and validate the case.</li>
<li>Create a landing page with a newsletter sign up form.</li>
<li>Continue researching the market, with more focus on the type of rewards you'll give. Promote the landing page while doing this and continue doing so until launching.</li>
<li>Prepare the crowdfunding page's copy, video, FAQ items, rewards, etc.</li>
<li>Everything else: write the pre- and post-launch emails, blog posts, and forum posts, plan what to do at key dates and events, scout the rewards-related logistics, etc. Your backers, bloggers, and journalists will be interacting with you throughout the campaign. That's a full time occupation, so come prepared in advance for all realistic scenarios you can think of.</li>
<li>Drum-roll your list and launch.</li>
</ol>

<p>Also, understand campaign dynamics. The ideal scenario is you being 50% funded or more within the first day or two -- users like to back and promote things that will succeed. And be prepared for the mid-campaign period, where not much happens unless you initiate it.</p>
