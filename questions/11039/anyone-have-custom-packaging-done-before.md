I'm looking to get custom packaging done for my new business, but I am unable to find the best solution. Unfortunately, I do not have much experience with this. I'm new to getting custom packaging so I need help knowing how to find a seller or website that will make me good, affordable boxes. Anyone have any experience with this?

Go to a local print shop. If they can't do it themselves they'll often direct you to someone you can.

Once you've found a printer or two, make sure that they have the relevant printers (ask to see them). Do this, because there are many print shops out there who actually are resellers (at a higher price) of other local shops. If they can't show you the printers, keep looking until you find them.

There also appears to be a few online shops that do this too. Google "print custom box". Speaking personally I'd feel safe assuming they're not outsourcing the actual printing - one can never be sure, of course, but I wouldn't worry too much about it in such cases unless the site looks dodgy.

For the design, make sure you hire someone who is competent with print jobs rather than online stuff only. You need design work that captures where the cuts should be, without leaving you with a white band or something on your box in the event the cuts aren't perfect (which happens).
