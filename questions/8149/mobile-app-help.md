<p>I am creating app that I hope one day will be home to a few thousand or more users! I think it is a pretty good idea and the people I have spoke with said that is something they would love to use. </p>

<p>I am the only developer working on it and my knowledge of programming is still minimal as I teach myself as I go but am in need of some extra help. The issue i'm running into are my funds. I was curious to see if anybody knows of a place where people are willing to help for free and get a chunk of equity out of the company one it is formed.</p>

<p>I realize that it is a risk for them but eventually it could pay off. I know a lot of people do not want to take a risk such as that and waste their time but it is something I am struggling with. I know a lot of people are eager to join the next big startup but since none of my buddies are majoring in CS or have any knowledge of programming i'm a bit stuck. Any suggestions/advice? </p>

<p>There's MakerHunt: </p>

<p><a href="https://www.makerhunt.co" rel="nofollow">https://www.makerhunt.co</a></p>

<p>This costs something but it still helps: </p>

<p><a href="http://makermvp.com" rel="nofollow">http://makermvp.com</a></p>

<p>And then there's GitHub, stackoverflow, Code Mentor, StackExchange Startups, tutorials, and a bunch of other places where you can learn coding and bits and pieces for what you need to do. </p>

<p>Hope that helps. </p>
