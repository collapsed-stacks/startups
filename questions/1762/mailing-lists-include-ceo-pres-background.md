<p>What's the low-cost way to acquire a list of local companies including industry type, revenue, and college degrees of the CEO? </p>

<p>We want to target companies headed by engineers/scientists. They don't have to be tech companies - we want to market by 'thinking style'.</p>

<p>The best way to get local business data in most areas is to join your local chamber of commerce. That being said many won't keep such a list or be willing to share it even with members to avoid inter-member spam. </p>

<p>Another low cost option would be local meetups or startup organizations. They would likely not have as complete of lists but would be more likely to be sharing them.</p>

<p>A third option though probably <strong>much <em>higher</em></strong> cost would be to rent/buy such a list from an advertising company - no guarantee you could find one but probably could easily determine if that is the case.</p>
