What's the low-cost way to acquire a list of local companies including industry type, revenue, and college degrees of the CEO? 

We want to target companies headed by engineers/scientists. They don't have to be tech companies - we want to market by 'thinking style'.

The best way to get local business data in most areas is to join your local chamber of commerce. That being said many won't keep such a list or be willing to share it even with members to avoid inter-member spam. 

Another low cost option would be local meetups or startup organizations. They would likely not have as complete of lists but would be more likely to be sharing them.

A third option though probably **much *higher*** cost would be to rent/buy such a list from an advertising company - no guarantee you could find one but probably could easily determine if that is the case.
