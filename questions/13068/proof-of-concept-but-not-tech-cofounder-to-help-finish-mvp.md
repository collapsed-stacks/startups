<p>I have an idea for a nightlife app that I have been working on for 5 years. I'm a longtime service industry veteran and my app is an elegant solution to a number of issues. I have vetted the idea against the 2 industry leaders (who are cash flow positive but have barely 5% of market share) and I've solved their most critical problem. I feel like I have the rare idea that is in the right place at the right time and yet I can't convince a developer to help me add the functionality to the wireframe I built. I have a few seed funders lined up for once I have a MVP. Aside from learning to code further than I already have, which I'm prepared to do to accomplish my dream, I know there must be a quicker way to get where I need to go. Not afraid of the work, but learning Java and becoming proficient at Xcode to do what I need will take precious time I don't have. Thoughts?</p>

<p>I am in a surprisingly similar situation - I have a nightlife app planned out, have some wireframes in place, and cannot afford to hire a developer.</p>

<p>My solution is to learn enough coding to program the basic features, and to hire someone to program the more complicated / technical features. That will greatly reduce the amount of money I need to spend on the developer!</p>

<p>In order to learn the basics of app coding, I hired a local tutor. I asked him to do two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Program a prototype app that includes several basic features I'll need (multiple pages you can swipe through, a menu bar, graphics, buttons that perform functions, etc.).</li>
<li>Walk me through the code of the prototype app and explain how each part works.</li>
</ol>

<p>It has been pretty successful. When I'm done programming what I can, and the remaining features are too complicated for me, I will hire the same tutor to complete those features.  You may want to use a similar approach in developing your app.</p>

<p>Good luck to you!</p>

<p>IMO usually it's little about the idea but mostly about implementation. You need a working MVP and if you aren't a programmer you'll waste too much time before you get anywhere.
What you could do instead is hire some developer to do that for you... what an obvious suggestion :) Even when I work on my startup I hire developers for some parts because I pay them 10-20 times less per hour that what I get paid. On UpWork you can find OK developers even for $5/hr, though if you aren't a developer yourself it will probably be tough to figure out who could be a good fit for your project regardless of their asking pay.</p>
