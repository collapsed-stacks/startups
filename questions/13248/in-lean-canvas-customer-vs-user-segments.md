I understood similar question has been answered previously about  https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/9809/who-is-my-customer

However, I am still not clear about how users and buyers should be defined when drafting up Lean Canvas. 

For example, if I have an idea of creating a better marketplace than eBay, where there is a range of tools that help buyers finding items they want to purchase easier. The idea is buyer oriented rather than enhancing any seller's capability. 

If the paying parties are customers, the sellers will be the customers rather than the buyers. 

When I draft up the Lean Canvas, the problem and solution will be describing the buyers' activities. Then, how do I describe the customer segments? It seems very natural to describe the buyers in the problem and solution as the idea is buyer-oriented. However, this will not ignore describing the actual paying customers? 

Hope one of you can help. Thanks!

Your customers are where the money comes from. If you're taking a % of the sake, that's the buyer. If you're charging a seller fee, that's the seller.

The other party is a partner or resource. You need to treat them very differently. While you may be selling them on benefits of being a partner, it's a much different relationship since they're not paying you.

On the *business model canvas* these are key partners and their goods are key resources.
