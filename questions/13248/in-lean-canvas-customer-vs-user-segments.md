<p>I understood similar question has been answered previously about  <a href="https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/9809/who-is-my-customer">Who is my customer?</a></p>

<p>However, I am still not clear about how users and buyers should be defined when drafting up Lean Canvas. </p>

<p>For example, if I have an idea of creating a better marketplace than eBay, where there is a range of tools that help buyers finding items they want to purchase easier. The idea is buyer oriented rather than enhancing any seller's capability. </p>

<p>If the paying parties are customers, the sellers will be the customers rather than the buyers. </p>

<p>When I draft up the Lean Canvas, the problem and solution will be describing the buyers' activities. Then, how do I describe the customer segments? It seems very natural to describe the buyers in the problem and solution as the idea is buyer-oriented. However, this will not ignore describing the actual paying customers? </p>

<p>Hope one of you can help. Thanks! </p>

<p>Your customers are where the money comes from. If you're taking a % of the sake, that's the buyer. If you're charging a seller fee, that's the seller.</p>

<p>The other party is a partner or resource. You need to treat them very differently. While you may be selling them on benefits of being a partner, it's a much different relationship since they're not paying you.</p>

<p>On the <em>business model canvas</em> these are key partners and their goods are key resources.</p>
