Long story short, I a couple other people are partnered in a startup. We have an idea for a web/mobile app that is now in the middle of development, but the developer left.

One of the avenues we are looking into is selling what source code we have along with the product rights and whatever documentation goes along with it.  But I don't know where to start.

I did find this:  http://www.bluecloudsolutions.com/articles/buy-sell-source-code/

But I'm not familiar with the app selling marketplaces it links.  Are they suitable for this kind of situation?  Are there other marketplaces and/or leads that can be used for such a thing?

Any tips for how to go about selling code + rights successfully?  (aside from ND and IP agreements, of course)

Thank you!

Long story short, [you don't](https://startups.stackexchange.com/a/1664/1824). If you don't have a proven market your idea and the source code that comes with it are worth about... well... a lot less than you're comfortable with.

You might [find a gullible buyer online](http://www.businessesforsale.com) on some site but, frankly, don't hold your breath.

Being a developer myself, I understand the time and effort on building apps/websites and it would be nice to be paid by the time spent on it. 

However, I wouldn't buy an incomplete source code. I would buy the idea or the IP from you, though.

Developers are picky and they like to code on what they are familiar with. Your chances might be too slim to find someone willing to pay for an incomplete app in a untested market with virtually no clients.

All the best!
