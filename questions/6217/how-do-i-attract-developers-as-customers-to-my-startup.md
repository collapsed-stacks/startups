Social Media
------------
Social media is a great way to get your idea out there. Facebook or Twitter or anything else you can think of is sure to attract people if you know how to promote correctly on sites using hashtags or anything else like that.
Dribbble
-------
There are tons of developers on Dribbble.com - it is a great way to showcase different products you are going to release and a great way to attract people to a product idea. The only problem with Dribbble is that you need to get an invite from other users by showing them your portfolio and being lucky enough to impress whoever it is you get sending your work to
Behance
-------
Behance is also like Dribbble, but you can post whatever you want on behance where as Dribbble you need to get an invite from other users. It is a great way to get your work out there and meet other people with different connections that could help you promote your idea.

Developers are very tricky to deal with as a class of customer. Think about the few developer communities you are involved in and how well they respond to sales / marketing posts. But you got to get your message out, right?

Consider the following:

 - Start with a developer focused blog, and leverage every kind of
   social media along with it (Jetpack in Wordpress is really handy for
   this)
   
 - Integrate your product / value proposition into all of your sigs, with links
 - Communicate regularly, answer questions of others related to your
   product; communicate about every update
 - Build confidence in what you are doing. A lot of dev tools are infrastructural in nature and nobody wants to commit to something that's going to disappear tomorrow
 - Figure out a way to include differentiating value in your product; you can have a new product in a maturing market space if that market space is large and you fill a specific need. Oh yeah, and make sure that differentiating value message is front and center

I really dislike the term "Growth Hack" because it is effectively  guerrilla marketing + metrics (and really not something new and shiny - the new and shiny comes from the marketing of the term "Growth Hack" and Millennial compatible explanations). But at the same time, you might want to do some searches for growth hacking techniques.
