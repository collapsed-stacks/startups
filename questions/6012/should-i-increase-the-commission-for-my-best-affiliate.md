Since I started the affiliate program, one of my users has brought a lot of users to my website. Is it the norm to increase the commission for the top performing affiliates in order to encourage them to work harder?

<h3>Answer</h3>
> **Yes!**

<h3>Use Sales Tiers</h3>

It is common to have a tiered structure for compensating sales. You are correct, this is used, among other things, to provide proper incentives and sales motivation. It's called "pay for performance" and it is effective.

<h3>"Good through" date gives you flexibility</h3>

You should post the tiers so everyone knows what they are. And also, provide a "good through" date. So you can maintain flexibility. Between 30 and 180 days with 90 days being a typical median for your "good through" period should be sufficient.
