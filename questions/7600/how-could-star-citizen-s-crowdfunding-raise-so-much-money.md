<p>Star Citizen is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest_funded_crowdfunding_projects" rel="nofollow">all-time highest</a> funded crowdfunding project:</p>

<p>I want to know why so many people thought Star Citizen deserved to be given money for it to succeed. What made so many people want to contribute their two cents? I believe there's something else besides people wanting a "space life simulator" that explains the amount raised is above $93 million.</p>
