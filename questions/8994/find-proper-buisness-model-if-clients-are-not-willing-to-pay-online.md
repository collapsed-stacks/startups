My startup idea is an interactive teaching platform (similar to khanacademy).

For this idea to have proper funding, it needs to maintain a good business plan. I have interviewed several people to discuss this; they like the idea but most of them don't use online payment. In my country, online payment is not a usual thing: Most people are either afraid of using this new payment method or don't have a credit card in the first place.

I can only think of selling ads or depending on donations and both of these options aren't strong enough to impress the committee. (The people who are going to fund this project)

What is a strong business model in such case?

I would avoid ads - unless you think you will attract millions and millions of users, the likelyhood of collecting any real income is slim. And the control of the adverts is outside your control, and can sometimes annoy others even if you are giving them something for free.

If I were in your shoe's, I would consider partnering with other educational institutions who offer education to similar market, but not directly cover the subjects you offer.  For example if your online education offered cooking lessons, then find an education center for hospitality.  Their reputation works in your favour, and your ability to increase the size of their portfolio of services that they offer works in their favour. 

Failing that - if you can tie your service to a product, then perhaps win some sponsorship from a product producer - they pay you (a discounted) fee in advance for so many end user credits, and give them away perhaps free to buyers of their product.

There is alot to be gained from partnering with someone even if they strictly not in your industry as it gives you brand recognition when you are the smallest youngest fish in the biggest of ponds.

Best of luck!
