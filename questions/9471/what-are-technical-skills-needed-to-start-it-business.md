<p>I am planning to do PHD but always wanted to open startup. In this phd, I have time of 3 year approximately. During this time, I want to develop software developing skills so that I can fullfill my dream of opening startup company. Can anyone please suggest the path and skill I need to acquire to start mini scale IT firm. Which technicalities I need to be strong so that I can get more projects. Currently I know java, linux administration,  networking but do not know about web development. Is startup in IT needed to know web development. I seen many startup failing in IT world due to lack of technical skills. </p>

<p>This is impossible to answer properly, because there is no Right Set of Skills.</p>

<p>The skills needed <em>completely</em> depend on the company you'll want to create, what role you'll want to have in it, and how quickly you can pick up new skills (which, let's be honest, is what you'll end up doing most of the time <em>anyway</em>, regardless of how much you prepare in advance).</p>

<p>Aside on:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This is incorrect in my experience. Nearly all start-ups in IT who failed that I've met or interacted with did so because the founders lacked basic management, marketing, and sales skills. What usually happens is technical founders or some idea guy end up having some vision they find brilliant, and creating whatever they fantasize is the next big thing without any market validation whatsoever... More often than not it's really a big ego trip. Come D-day they try to get some press and some attention for a "Big Launch", miserably fail at doing so more often than not because it actually takes months of prep work or a lot of luck. They then eventually panic because it turns out that they've burnt nearly all of their resources on something that nobody is in any rush to use - let alone pay to use.</p>

<p>It is not mandatory to learn any technical skills. But It is must to have good exposure on current trends in computer science &amp; Technologies to get the best work from your resources.</p>
