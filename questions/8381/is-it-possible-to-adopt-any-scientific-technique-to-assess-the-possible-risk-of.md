Suppose, I want to import product from China and sell it to the local market through an online business.

First, I establish an web-site. Then, I import product from China and keep it in my store hoping to sell.

How can I assess various types of risks of my startup before starting my business?

Is it possible to adopt any scientific technique to systematically assess the risk beforehand?
