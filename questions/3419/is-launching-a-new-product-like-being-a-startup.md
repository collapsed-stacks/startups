<p>I work at a company that has a few products, most of which are in the mature stage. We just released a new product and when trying to gain new business and attention to this product, it feels a lot like its own startup company. Can launching a totally new product have the same feeling as starting a new business?</p>

<p><strong>I use to work at a large software company</strong> where a lot of members bragged that the team had a startup mentality. I was told that each product group was able to make their own decisions and there was a drive &amp; excitement in completing tasks and getting features out to customers. At the time, I accepted this as a primer for being in a startup.</p>

<p><strong>Fast forward 10 years</strong> where I am running my own startup and I've come to realize that the team I was on was <em>very</em> different from being on a startup. </p>

<p><strong>The first major difference is funding</strong>. In my previous company, from prior successful products, we had funding to spare which allowed us to hire many project managers, developers, and testers; get the best of equipment; and not have to worry about spending an extra couple of months getting the project out to market. At my current startup, I have to find people that are willing to work for a dream, use their own equipment &amp; offices, and produce results. There's not a whole lot of flexibility in the schedule to experiment on new technologies or designs.</p>

<p><strong>The second major difference are the support teams</strong>. I really didn't think about how much effort was put into infrastructure at my previous company. I hadn't really put much thought into who was creating the build systems, setting up web servers, or writing licences. They just magically appeared as we were shipping. At my current startup, I am very much involved with all of that &amp; I don't have support teams to help out. There's only the one team and we help out each other, so we're all involved in this.</p>

<p><strong>The third major difference is pressure to succeed</strong>. As @blunders mentioned, if the company fails, it fails. Which means that me &amp; my team are out of a job &amp; we just wasted a year or more of our time and money. However, if the company succeeds, then we all reap the rewards. Very rarely will you get profit sharing in a large corporation, but you almost always do in a startup (in one form or another).</p>

<p><strong>All that said</strong>, I do see why the notion of my previous company being a startup was being spread. Startups have the appeal of being flexible &amp; lively while also creating drive to burn the midnight oil in order to succeed. What company wouldn't want their employees to feel that way about their job?</p>

<p>No, they're not the same. If the company fails, it fails - if a new product fails in an existing company, the company does not fail.</p>

<p>No, a start-up company typically has very little funding and very few employees working many long hours and "wearing many hats" to create and promote a product. It is highly risky since you don't know if and when you product will be successful enough to bring in enough money for the company to become stable.</p>

<p>If you are just launching a new product at another company, you likely already have the funding to ensure all the employees are getting paid, are working reasonable hours and that you have a reasonable number of employees working for you. This is because you presumably have other products that are already generating income and profit for the company.</p>
