I am in the middle of creatinga new social website.

What are the possible things that could bring me **unexpected financial problems after launch**?

For example - the fonts. If I hadn't taken the fonts into account, I would have gotten me problems with the copyright.

Thanks

The fonts?! If you use off the peg fonts, you are not likely to step on toe's.

There are countless reasons as to where you might offend the law or a patent or a copyright or a trademark. Multiply this by different countries and it is a wonder why anyone would ever consider starting a company. 

But startups do start!

I would suggest you look at the positives - ask yourself why anyone would want to use your service/product. Once you determine that there is demand, then go create it. You might find it takes you a lot longer than you might otherwise think. I am 18months into a product that I figured would take me 6months and I am about 95% finished for the past couple of months.

When you are not making your product/service, give thought as to how you will market it.

I also suggest you read a similar question asked previously, which I answered - at very least, read points 1,2,3 6 and 7.

Best of luck!
