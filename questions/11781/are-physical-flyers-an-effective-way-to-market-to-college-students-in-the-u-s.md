<p>My product is a free app. One of my main target customer groups is college students in the United States. Among other ways of reaching them, I'm thinking of printing up simple, good-looking flyers and hiring local students at various colleges &amp; universities to hand them out to other students.  Does anyone have experience with this?  Was it effective in getting students to download your app?</p>

<p>I don't have direct experience with this technique from the company's side, but at a major state university in Texas, this was routinely used by student groups, labs &amp; university departments, and outside companies, and seemed to be quite effective in raising awareness.</p>

<p>One key to 'successful' campaigns (anecdotally judged by how many students saw / were aware of it) was LOTS of flyers, posted in every room/hallway/classroom of the building(s) that house your audience - dorms, engineering building, science building, liberal arts building, dining halls, etc.</p>
