I am starting a company where I help raising capital to other financial companies, mainly in the UK. Basically I need to draft a capital introduction contract, between the financial companies that I help raising capital and my company.

What clauses should I make sure to include in a capital introduction contract? Is there anything I should be aware of when trying to find or writing one?

Beyond that, are there any examples or templates that I might be able to work off of cheaply?

You're starting a company, not an industry. So your competitors have the answer.

So you have the good old fashioned task of market research. Spend four weeks tracking down and engaging everyone in your networks who could have (or have access to) such a contract or associated correspondence until you have a bunch of examples. Go through clause by clause and ask, who is this for and what problem does it solve for them? 

At the end of that process you will have the insight to make a specification and the raw materials to write the contract, or at least a good first draft that a lawyer could finish off.
