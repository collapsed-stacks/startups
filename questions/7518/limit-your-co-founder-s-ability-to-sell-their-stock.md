It is common to have some clauses that between co-founders of a company, that when they are going to sell their share, they need to get approval from the company, i.e. vote via a board meeting?

Usually, you set rules like this in the by-laws of the company.

Example by-law:

> The right to transfer shares of the Corporation shall be restricted in
> that no shareholder shall be entitled to transfer any share or shares
> of the Corporation without the approval of:
> 
> the directors of the Corporation expressed by resolution passed by the
> votes cast by a majority of the directors of the Corporation at a
> meeting of the board of directors or signed by all of the directors of
> the Corporation; or the shareholders of the Corporation expressed by
> resolution passed by the votes cast by a majority of the shareholders
> who voted in respect of the resolution or signed by all shareholders
> entitled to vote on that resolution.
