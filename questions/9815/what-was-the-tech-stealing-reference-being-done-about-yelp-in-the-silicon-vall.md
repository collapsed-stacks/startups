<p>In the Silicon Valley show, when the CEO was explaining the technology (the middle-ware to be specific) to a bunch of curious VCs, the marketing guy takes him out and explains to the CEO that the VC firm is stealing ideas from them:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We used to do this at Hooli all the time. We schedule meetings with companies so that they explain their technologies, then introduce their ideas in our products</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then, the CEO replies:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Like what happened to Yelp?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, <strong>what was the related incident of Yelp which they were referring to?  How did if effect Yelp?</strong></p>

<p>This <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SiliconValleyHBO/comments/339sty/just_like_what_happened_to_yelp/" rel="nofollow">Reddit thread</a> and <a href="https://www.quora.com/Was-Yelp-a-stolen-idea" rel="nofollow">Quora question</a> suggest it's likely a reference to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yelp#Private_company_.282009.E2.80.932011.29" rel="nofollow">acquisition negotiations</a> Yelp entered into with Google, with Google Places following shortly after.</p>
