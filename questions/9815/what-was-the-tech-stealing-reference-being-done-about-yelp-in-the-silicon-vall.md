In the Silicon Valley show, when the CEO was explaining the technology (the middle-ware to be specific) to a bunch of curious VCs, the marketing guy takes him out and explains to the CEO that the VC firm is stealing ideas from them:

> We used to do this at Hooli all the time. We schedule meetings with companies so that they explain their technologies, then introduce their ideas in our products

Then, the CEO replies:

> Like what happened to Yelp?

So, **what was the related incident of Yelp which they were referring to?  How did if effect Yelp?**

This [Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/SiliconValleyHBO/comments/339sty/just_like_what_happened_to_yelp/) and [Quora question](https://www.quora.com/Was-Yelp-a-stolen-idea) suggest it's likely a reference to the [acquisition negotiations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yelp#Private_company_.282009.E2.80.932011.29) Yelp entered into with Google, with Google Places following shortly after.
