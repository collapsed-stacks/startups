I'm starting an educational business, and I have an application that sends emails on special events each and every day to my customers. For example, on their registration, when they accomplish their daily assignments, when they move to an upper level and so on.

Let's say I have 5 thousand customers, and each will receive 1 to 5 emails per day. That is 5 to 25 thousand emails per day.

I can't use Gmail (even Gmail for businesses) because it has a daily limit of 500 (or so). I can't use Zoho because it has a limit of 1500 emails per day.

I don't want to use mail campaigns, because this is not essentially a campaign, and I need to send emails via the workflow of my application, that is integrated into my business and happens automatically. But AMAIK mail campaigns are not built for that need.

What should I do? I'm stuck at this point, and to my surprise the more I search, the less I find.

This is called "transactional email." Search for that and you will find a ton of services with APIs / SMTP access that will accommodate you.
