I'm looking into creating a shop and I'm interested in  

 - the market share within a sector  
 - the sales figures  
 - the sales figures of a specific sector  

of some big companies producing electric household appliances, like BSH and GE for example.

I have already looked at the annual report of some of them. Keeping that in mind, I cannot promise though that I haven't overlooked something because I only skimmed through them somewhat quickly.

Which keywords should I look for in the annual report? Is there a resource I can use for this which I haven't found yet?

PS: There is no budget for this, I can't buy a study for $1000 or more.

There are a few sources for sales figures and market share:

* For public companies, **quarterly reports and press releases** probably are your best bet

* Sometimes, managers and executives at companies will boast about their sales figures and market share in their **LinkedIn resumes**. Managers may only report numbers for their division but you can still get estimates

* Market share numbers are more likely in **paid reports**. Two ways to get paid reports for free are: 

1. **University libraries** sometimes have free licenses to reporting services. 

2. If you **contact the author** of the paid report with a friendly and eager email as an entrepreneur, sometimes they will share it with you for free (the authors usually make their money from big companies so they're not really losing out by giving it to you)

Btw, I think you meant electric household **appliances**. :)
