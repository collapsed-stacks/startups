<p>One advice that I would like to give to startup entrepreneurs is to not focus on making short term profits and target on the bigger goals. As said by <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/varun-manian#/entity" rel="nofollow">Varun Manian</a> "Entrepreneurship is not only about making Profits" </p>
