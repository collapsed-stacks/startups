<p>Many software packages have drastically different pricing for 'home' use versus 'professional' use.  In most cases the differences in functionality between the two is minimal.  </p>

<p>Taking <a href="http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/pricing/industry-individuals.php?desktop" rel="nofollow">Mathematica</a> as an example; the price for home use is $295 and the price for the standard package is $2,495.  The standard package states that it is licensed for professional use and includes the following blurb:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Products that are licensed for professional use allow for personal and work use. Products that are not licensed for professional use include the same functionality, but are intended for personal, nonprofessional use only.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What is my legal obligation to not use this for business purposes?  What are the possible consequences of doing so?  My intention would be to use the software for research purposes, but I would never roll out packages based on the software to customers.</p>

<p>Personal use means whatever the terms of the agreement state.  If it is not stated in the terms, I would ask the company directly in writing.  </p>

<p>That said, based on my experience, personal use means you are not allowed to use a product or service in a way that the IRS would classify as self-employed, business, or non-profit use.  </p>
