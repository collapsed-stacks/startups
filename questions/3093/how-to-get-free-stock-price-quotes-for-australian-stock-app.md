<p>There are many stock trading apps that provide free stock price quotes.</p>

<p>I am developing a stock app but find that it is very expensive to get the stock price data from the Australian Stock Exchange.</p>

<p>I don't think the free apps pay for the stock price quotes as they are offering the stock apps for free.</p>

<p>Can anyone tell me how I can get free access to stock price data for my app?</p>

<p>Let me know.</p>

<p>According to "<a href="http://www.asx.com.au/documents/professionals/asx-information-vendors-guide.pdf" rel="nofollow">Information Vendors Guide by the Australian Securities Exchange</a>" - there are no free sources for the feed. Please be aware that direct use of a feed is not the same as a license to aggregate the data to third-parties; guessing this is obvious to you, but point it out since to some it might not be.</p>
