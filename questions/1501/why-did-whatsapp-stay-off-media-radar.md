<p>In <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QRx0RsnmmU&amp;t=28m57s" rel="nofollow">this video</a> you can see the founder saying that they tried to stay off the media radar for as long as possible. </p>

<p>Does anyone know what the benefits to such a strategy would be or why they chose it?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jan Koum: To be fair, its been our goal to stay off Techcrunch for as long as
  possible, or any media. Our goal has been to stay under the radar and
  avoid media for as long as we can. (28:57-29:09)</p>

<p>Watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-pJa11YvCs">video</a> from Startup School 2014
Here's the relevant quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sam Altman: Why did you want to stay under the reader [radar]? (sic)</p>
  
  <p>Jan Koum: Right, so we felt that if people were talking about us, writing about us from the press it would be a disruption to the employees and be a distraction to me and Brian. We would have to comment on it internally or, you know, do something about it, and and we just felt that if we don't talk to the press, which we tried not to do for the most part, we would be able to focus on the product and that was our strategy and I think that worked for us because we really were able to focus on the product.</p>
