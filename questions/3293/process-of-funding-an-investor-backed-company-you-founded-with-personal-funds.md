[This question][1] made me wonder, what would be the funding process for a company you founded which has already been backed by multiple investors and after a while you decide to add in your personal funds. What would be the price of new issued stocks?

That would be up to the existing investors to decide. You'd basically round them up in a shareholder meeting. They'd need to agree that the company needs more money and that it makes sense to issue more shares (instead of e.g. getting a loan). Upon agreeing to issue more shares and on the latter's valuation, existing (or new) investors who want to put money into the company at that valuation would receive additional stock.
