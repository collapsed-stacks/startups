<p>Several words in your question were spelled wrong or used incorrectly. If your ad had a similar issue, people may not trust your business. I recommend making sure that all the words in your ad are spelled and used correctly.</p>

<p>Beyond that, we would need to see your ad to understand why it was effective or not.</p>

<p>A suggestion:  you could create several ads, then have a focus group of your target users tell you which one they prefer.</p>
