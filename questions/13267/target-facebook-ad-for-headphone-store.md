Several words in your question were spelled wrong or used incorrectly. If your ad had a similar issue, people may not trust your business. I recommend making sure that all the words in your ad are spelled and used correctly.

Beyond that, we would need to see your ad to understand why it was effective or not.

A suggestion:  you could create several ads, then have a focus group of your target users tell you which one they prefer.
