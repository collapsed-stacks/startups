As a company making profits in multiple countries abroad how does one go about setting up the [Double Irish arrangement][1]? Are there any consultancy or legal firms that provide mechanism for setting it up?

<p>The most important thing about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Irish_arrangement" rel="nofollow">double Irish arrangement</a> is the fact that the money has to stay in the low tax country. In general, it's a lot of hassle. It only makes sense if you expect a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_amnesty" rel="nofollow">tax amnesty</a> to happen anytime soon:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Tax amnesty</strong> is a limited-time opportunity for a specified group of taxpayers to pay a defined amount, in exchange for forgiveness of a
  tax liability (including interest and penalties) relating to a
  previous tax period or periods and without fear of criminal
  prosecution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If it doesn't, you got a lot of stress, bad publicity and work for nothing in return. </p>

<p>Apple for example doesn't really avoid paying taxes, they just have not to paid it yet. In the meantime they could reinvest locally, but if your income is below a certain amount, spare the work.</p>
