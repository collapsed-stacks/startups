i am looking to find more clients for my walking tour,travel & tourism company based in NYC.
Social medias and my website are a good way to get some, word of mouth is another one but i am looking to get more.

What are the best channels or companies/structures i could contact to get more clients or collaborations?

Thank you very much!

This is mainly about your marketing strategy. 

> How convincing are you?

Agree websites and word-of-mouth are a way to get clients, but they all are secondary. The important is that you take part in conferencing, setup booths and may be go tourism places and market.

Conferencing mainly about Travel! and also make sure to have enough materials to promote your idea/product. Materials also include appropriate content.

There are companies that help you get clients for your company, but my personal view is that clients form that companies don't last longer. 

FYI: Travel is huge market, you may want to target very specific and then expand. Or else your product my get lost with others.
