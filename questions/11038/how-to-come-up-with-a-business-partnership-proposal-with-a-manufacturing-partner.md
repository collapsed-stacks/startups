<p>My business involves manufacturing finished product of Steel Cookwares (say) and selling it to resellers. I have identified a cookware manufacturing team (already in business for X yrs) who agreed to partner with my team as I don't have the resources required to make the finished product.</p>

<p>My team will have to source/handle - capital, branding, intellectual properties such as original designs, go to market strategy, marketing, sales and run the whole show.</p>

<p>The manufacturing team will source the raw materials, employees, skills, tools, equipment for manufacturing the final product.</p>

<p>As they are very much interested with the unique lineup of steel cookwares, they are even ready to open a separate vertical to handle the orders I get from the market. The manufacturing team is asking me to come up with Business Partnership proposal and a Business Plan for the business to start the operations.</p>

<p>What all I should cover in such a business proposal with my partner business? How do I go about it?</p>
