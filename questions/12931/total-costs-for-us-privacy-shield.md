Does anyone know the total annual costs for a small company (less than $5 million annual revenue) to self-certify to Privacy Shield?

The [website][1] says that the cost is $250 or $375 depending on whether you join one or both of EU and Swiss programs and also states that there are two more costs:

> Providers of such services set their own fees.  Furthermore, the

> costs as described in Annex I to the Principles.

For {1}, I understand that you can use a US provider or a EU data protection authority.  Anyone know the cost for these two options?

For {2}, I have no idea what this is and how much it costs.
