<p>Does anyone know the total annual costs for a small company (less than $5 million annual revenue) to self-certify to Privacy Shield?</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/Program-Overview" rel="nofollow noreferrer">website</a> says that the cost is $250 or $375 depending on whether you join one or both of EU and Swiss programs and also states that there are two more costs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Organizations will have additional direct costs associated with
  participating in the Privacy Shield. For example, Privacy Shield
  organizations {1} <strong>must provide a readily available independent recourse
  mechanism</strong> to hear individual complaints at no cost to the individual.
  Providers of such services set their own fees.  Furthermore, the
  Frameworks require that {2} <strong>the Department of Commerce facilitate the
  establishment of a fund, into which Privacy Shield organizations will
  be required to pay an annual contribution</strong>, which will cover arbitral
  costs as described in Annex I to the Principles.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For {1}, I understand that you can use a US provider or a EU data protection authority.  Anyone know the cost for these two options?</p>

<p>For {2}, I have no idea what this is and how much it costs.</p>
