I'm hoping someone could kindly tell me the best way to get page views/backers to my crowdfunding campaign I'm thinking of launching.
There are so many articles and ideas but having run a failed crowdfunding campaign in the past I know that a lot of these ideas are just fillers.
It would be nice to know the best surefire way of getting the views.

Also I notice a fair few projects boasting with a product review on big websites or tv shows (sky news etc) - do they get this done before hand or during the project?

Thanks
Ps love this helpful community

Typically, crowdfunding platforms are a way to reach out to a community that you're already engaged with and ask for funding. They're not, in general, a way to reach unknown benefactors.

So I would be focusing on the former and enabling the latter. Talk to your community about the campaign you're planning, and get them involved. Then to enable the latter, you will want to make sure the project is sufficiently interesting and the rewards sufficiently interesting that the people you already know will be encouraged to push your campaign and their support out into their networks.

There are projects that break out of this expectation and get massive support from unexpected sources. These are rare, but of course they're newsworthy, so they're what we tend to fixate on. So there's no harm trying this route even when you don't have the community engagement you need to ensure success. Just be realistic. Nobody has a formula for how to get arbitrary projects crowd funded by strangers, nor could they (do the math!). Media interest will clearly do you good, and again it's a help to have built a relationship with a community if you want an interesting story that could get coverage.

Good luck!

Barry think of that everything around us -really everything- is a product. So, if you focus how to create a successful product with a strong brand which is a pretty deep topic whatever you come up with and say "People! This is * * * and it does * * * by doing * * * for ***" you will get more than you might guess.  

Just really focus how create something people will be ***touched***   

***The Best* of luck!**

My advice : Set a relatively low goal that you, your friends, your followers, former B2B customers can reach just by yourself.

Once this goal is reached, the press will be interested in you.

Nobody wants to support a project that may fail, but if you're successfully funded already, why not ?

In our campaign, we reached our goal in 3 days, because we prepared pre-orders with friends, mentors, former customers etc... (don't buy with your own money, that's illegal ! But there's nothing wrong with pre-campaign orders.)

We didn't know exactly the amount we would get, but we knew the goal could be reached fast.

Once the goal is reached, you can contact the press more easily. (They won't come to you, you have to reach them)


Another approach is to reach 5k followers on facebook before starting the campaign (not an easy thing to do of course) using advertisement or just hype and personal circles, then push those followers to back you on day 1.


Don't give up though ! All the people who backed you will probably back again ! That's a hell of a good start ! Many failed campaigns had a great success after a little design refactor.

<p>When it comes to <strong>crowdfunding</strong>, each project is unique therefore each approach will need a <em>finely crafted message</em>. It depends on a variety of factors:</p>

<ul>
<li>How broad is your target audience?</li>
<li>How much is your product or service (how much do you want to sell it for)?</li>
<li>Is it digital, can people sign up for a free trial?</li>
<li>Is it a tangible physical product, do you have videos of it being used?</li>
<li>Do you know any influencers who can promote your brand?*</li>
</ul>

<p>There are many other questions to ask when crafting your message. Here is a link to a <strong>list of great tools</strong> for your <em>crowdsourcing campaign</em>. I hope this helps.</p>

<p><a href="http://learninternetgrow.com/crowdfunding-tools/" rel="nofollow">Crowdfunding Tools for your Marketing Campaign</a></p>

<p>Additionally, you should get listed on:</p>

<ol>
<li>ProductHunt</li>
<li>Capterra</li>
<li>App Shopper</li>
<li>Maqtoob</li>
<li>GetApp</li>
</ol>

<p>Make sure you have a <strong>website</strong> and a <strong>landing page</strong> which has an <strong>email opt-in</strong>. </p>

<p>You want to build your email list before you launch so you can pull them back once you are ready to go.</p>

<p>Getting <strong>traffic</strong> to your <em>site/app/crowdfunding page</em> is no easy task and like everyone else's project it is unique so it needs a unique approach. Unfortunately, there is no cookie cutter method.</p>

<p>Check out all the tools listed in the link because you need to find influencers in your niche and journalists. Journalists need stories and if yours is one that has an attention-getting feel, you will likely get press after you reach out to enough of these influencers. </p>

<p>The <strong>PR</strong> could come in the form of <strong>social shares, backlinks, and actual mainstream media coverage</strong> although the latter is challenging as it is a numbers game to get the attention of journalists.</p>
