<p>As the title suggests, I have a questionnaire for some market research. My target group is school students from class 5 to 12.</p>

<p>I want to motivate them to do a survey and be as honest as possible. I would provide them with money, but I am very unsure if this is the best idea!?</p>

<p>If it's a survey, I would really suggest asking their parent's permissions first and giving the money to the parents. Since you dont want to be held liable on how those children misuse the money you gave to them.</p>

<p>Ask their parents to sign an agreement in return for , then the parents can decide for themself what they want to do with the money if you end up giving them monetary incentive. </p>
