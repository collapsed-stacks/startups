<p>My product: anti website defacement service 
Stage: product complete. Private beta out. Looking for users.</p>

<p>I recently spoke to a VC who reached out to me to discuss my startup. I told him that we already have a beta out and are looking for about 50 small users to do a pilot test with to get their feedback.  But the VC recommended that I target 1 or 2 large enterprises instead and get them on the Beta.</p>

<p>My question is how do I sell to an enterprise client? I do not know how much to charge or who to talk to. Furthermore everyone that I've been emailing is ignoring me. What should I do?</p>

<p>Option A) Hire a person to sell for you. Selling takes experience, and you seem to need a business partner who is good at selling.</p>

<p>Option B) Do it yourself. </p>

<p>About how much to charge:
How much value loss do you prevent? I.e. enterprise client's website is defaced. How much do they lose? What if your solution is applied - how much less they will lose? On the other hand - what if there are no attacks coming? How much should you charge?? There are many variants to choose from, your business monetization model is ultimately up to you - trial and error will help, looking at what competitors do will also help. Alternatively you can just calculate your costs, slap 15-20% above that and make it your price - but your VC might object that this isn't the best way, because it isn't. So, figure out who your customers are and what your product offers them, after that see what you can receive for your product.</p>
