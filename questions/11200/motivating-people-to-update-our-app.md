We developed a smartphone app that will be used to monitor prices of an item in different stores; think of something similar to a gas app where the users can view the prices of gas close to their location.

So we already have the following:

    * Via GPS, show user the closest location with the item and its price.
    * A form for the user to update the price at a certain location.

Now we're working on how to motivate a user to update the app. Unlike apps like gasbuddy that have an integrated & complex system for accumulating points and giving away prizes, we don't have that.

So how can we motivate the user to update the app with its most current price? We can give away prizes, money, etc, but we cannot add any of that functionality to the app. At least for now, it's not in our budget.

Thanks.
