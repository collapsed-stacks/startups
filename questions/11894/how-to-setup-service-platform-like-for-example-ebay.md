Ebay is a mediator and earns his money getting a certain percentage of the sale and other things.

It's a marketplace where buyers and sellers come together.

**My question:**
How to get started with this kind of service platform?
For example we already have the technical stuff in place, hosting and a production ready web platform.
At the beginning the platform is empty, no offers and therefore no buyers.

When I would see a platform, that only offers two things for example, I would not place my offer there, because the probability that someone will buy is very low.

**How to push the platform in order to bring more buyers and sellers together?
How did Ebay do it?**

<p>Anything that requires a network effect to become useful is a challenge to get started.  Facebook, AirBnB, even Stack Exchange faced the same challenge of how to start when both the chicken and the egg need to come first.  I would recommend researching the topic of network effect to get some ideas. Here is one such link to get you started. <a href="http://a16z.com/2016/03/07/all-about-network-effects/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">All about Network Effects</a></p>

<p>As I hear from sales guys, the advice to get into a new market segment is to start with a very specific target audience. Think about whom you want to serve precisely. Understand their needs, make them happy so they will return and recommend your platform further. Give your platform a specific appearance which makes it interesting for your specific target audience.</p>

<p>Don't try to compete with big marketplaces, don't offer just everything, trying desperately to attract a broad range of people.</p>

<p>There are many sales guides out there, more or less boiling down to the same. Maybe have a look at this <a href="http://edwardlowe.org/how-to-identify-a-target-market-and-prepare-a-customer-profile/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">one</a>.</p>

<p>Once you understand your target audience and have a solid customer base, then you might grow into different market segments.</p>

Agreeing with the other answers, I have also seen similar success in focusing on your local market.  It's like tareq's answer to focus on a niche.  For example Facebook started as a Harvard-only students site, then expanded to a curated list of colleges, then all colleges, then the public.  

More than just gaining traction, this gives **you** something bite-sized to focus on, especially since you know your local market better than anyone doing the same thing.
