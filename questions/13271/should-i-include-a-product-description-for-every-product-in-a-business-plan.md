I am writing up a Business Plan, for my own perusal rather than for investment purposes.  The Business will start off with a focus on providing decorative Storage Boxes.  

Initially, there will be 50 variations in design, size and shape.  The potential customer will be able to choose from 50 different pieces of Art to be applied to the Storage Box.

For the purpose of the Business Plan, should I highlight each and every design (with pictorial examples) or simply reference the fact there will be 50 different designs followed by a breakdown of the available sizes and shapes? 

I know that this could very well be a personal preference, since the Business Plan will only be for my own use.  That said, it would be good to hear of a 'good practice' or get an idea of what is typically placed in the Product section of a Business Plan, for future reference.

As you mentioned this is for your own use, it is entirely up to you what you want to include in the business plan. 

For business plan to share with others, I would not include these details or add an amendment specifically for the detailed descriptions and graphics. Reason behind this is that these are variations to the core product but the core product stays essentially the same, so these details have impact perhaps from marketing perspective, but not from perspective of what business does per se. It's a semantics detail, important one in the big scope of things, but in scope of business plan, not so much.

Also, just a wild guess, but these designs and shapes are probably subject to change as you discover which ones are more popular, gets sold more, as you optimize sales strategy. So it's something quite mutable as well.
