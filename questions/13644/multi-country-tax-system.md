You'll probably pay tax in the country where your business is registered. Offering the service in 50 country doesn't make you(r company) pay tax everywhere.

Tax is a broad topic and not as easy as some wish it to be. 

For your question: it depends. If you are only selling from one country, you only have to pay taxes there, imaging shipping physical goods. If you are legally selling from different countries, you have to pay taxes in every country you are allowed to do business. 

But just because you have to pay taxes, doesn't mean you will acquire taxable revenue. Big companies own sub-companies in countries with lower tax rates and arrange their business and finance structure in a way that they only make profit in countries with low taxes and sometimes even make losses in countries with high tax rates and thus saving millions in taxes.

But in doubt, it is best to talk to an expert who can decide these things after having seen your company's sale and finance structure.
