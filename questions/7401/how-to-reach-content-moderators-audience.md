<p>Most content moderators are hired by big American tech companies, but work overseas in low-wage jobs working for consulting firms in the Philippines, India, and the like. They see the worst of what the Internet has to offer, so keep that in mind. For smaller websites/apps, either one of the webmasters/admins does moderation. Automated approaches are not perfect. Those who volunteer to moderate care about the volunteering part. Looking on LinkedIn reveals a heavy SEO/social media background, many people who are not fluent in English, and a fairly large female audience. 
In terms of communities, there appears to be no online forums/groups.  </p>
