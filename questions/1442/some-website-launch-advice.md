We are launching website. It will sell electronic things. We have just few data as initial. e.g .mobile, tablet, laptop related data but don't have data for other electronic gadgets.

In the selling form we show gadgets that you can sell. Shall we show selling option for gadgets other than mobile,laptop, tablet in our page.?

Will it make a negative impact if we include e.g. Refrigerator in selling form drop down option (as initially we only have three gadgets related data) ?

I would show the web site to potential customers (if I understand correctly, these are people, who want to sell electronic devices) and ask them what they think about the form.

The question is - where can you find your target audience to ask this question?

One way to do it, is to go to a place, where many of them are concentrated. For example, you could compile a list of all eBay sellers, who sell electronic devices and ask them via personalized messages.

Then you will have feedback from people, who are supposed to use your site.

You first need to think about whether you want to sell anything and everything or intend to create a brand that carves out a specific niche in the long term
 
You need to ask yourself a question, **What you envision your site to be 5 years down the line ?**. Based on the answer, you'd go about contacting this specific group of users and getting feedback from them. I came across a very useful article that might shed light on your issue

Sell only what you know you are able to do so in such a way that no one is able to do so in such a way as you - otherwise you're only selling what someone else might sell too.
