<p>We are launching website. It will sell electronic things. We have just few data as initial. e.g .mobile, tablet, laptop related data but don't have data for other electronic gadgets.</p>

<p>In the selling form we show gadgets that you can sell. Shall we show selling option for gadgets other than mobile,laptop, tablet in our page.?</p>

<p>Will it make a negative impact if we include e.g. Refrigerator in selling form drop down option (as initially we only have three gadgets related data) ?</p>

<p>I would show the web site to potential customers (if I understand correctly, these are people, who want to sell electronic devices) and ask them what they think about the form.</p>

<p>The question is - where can you find your target audience to ask this question?</p>

<p>One way to do it, is to go to a place, where many of them are concentrated. For example, you could compile a list of all eBay sellers, who sell electronic devices and ask them via personalized messages.</p>

<p>Then you will have feedback from people, who are supposed to use your site.</p>

<p>You first need to think about whether you want to sell anything and everything or intend to create a brand that carves out a specific niche in the long term</p>

<p>You need to ask yourself a question, <strong>What you envision your site to be 5 years down the line ?</strong>. Based on the answer, you'd go about contacting this specific group of users and getting feedback from them. I came across a very useful article that might shed light on your issue</p>

<p>Sell only what you know you are able to do so in such a way that no one is able to do so in such a way as you - otherwise you're only selling what someone else might sell too.</p>
