I have chosen a domain that is already registered with .com tld by some one else. I would like buy same domain name with different extensions. Our website will be offering Job preparation, Assessment, Interview experiences, Job posting and blogging. Except .com and .net many generic and country level TLDs are available. I prefer buying generic TLDs for international market.

How about .jobs?

I think that must suit your requirements.

You already have a .com

Don't bother buying any more:

1) SEO (Getting ranked in Google etc) is hard.  It is doubly hard with 2 sites, because basically SEO is a competition, and you´ve chosen to enter it with 2 competitors - who will require twice as much attention to get to the same place if you´d only entered one.

2) ... which would have been much further ahead if you'd just concentrated on one and put in the same effort.

3) Duplicate content issues if the content is the same.

Much better to hang all the content off the one domain and have folders e.g.  /marketing-jobs or /australia etc.

The only reason'd I'd buy a different domain would be to track referrals e.g. from a magazine (offline) ad.   You put the ad. in the Magazine with the different domain, and that redirects the visitor to the primary site, logging the activity.

<p>Finally end up with .io tld, you can visit my site at <a href="http://www.job360.io" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Job360</a> . Why I consider .io it looks that .io is short and it's popularity is increasing day be day.  I didn't consider '.co' due to confusions between '.com' and '.co' see <a href="https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/6055/what-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-using-io-vs-co">what-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-using-io-vs-co</a> .</p>
