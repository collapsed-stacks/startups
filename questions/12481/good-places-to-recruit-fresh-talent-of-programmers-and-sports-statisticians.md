<p>I am a young entrepreneur searching for staff to invest time that will be rewarded by completion of a innovative service for profit. I need to find hungry programmers preferably between ages 16 &amp; 24.I've started on my source code for the software I want to create but without the help of statisticians/programmers to help proofread it won't be ready for users anytime soon. I need at least one of each. </p>

<p>Hungry programmers at that age? I really doubt it. They're most likely still at college and have no interest in working on a start-up that won't pay them well (Read: only give equity) </p>

<p>That aside, here's several methods depending on your conditions that might land you with an employee.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>How is your track record? Do you have any notable working experience and/or reputation?</strong> If yes, try finding talented people from your previous working place and give them incentive to leave their safe spot. This is by far the most common thing that happens to young entrepreneur but only can work if you are <em>good</em> enough.</li>
<li><strong>Do you have a lot of funding?</strong> If yes, try to create a campaign to attract talented people. It can start from something as simple as paying for a space at your local newspaper or a social media campaign.</li>
<li><strong>Do not have both? What do I do?</strong> If you are in this position, finding someone to work with you might be pretty hard since people most likely don't want to leave their spot for a start-up without a strong foundation but what you can do is usually find a friend that want to work with you (probably as a co-founder) if your friend can answer "yes" to one of the questions above then it'll be a significant boost to your start-up.</li>
</ol>

<p>As with any 'sales-type' task, you need to think like the people you are wanting to find</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Where do they hang out</strong> (physically or online)? You should put this sort of message on those forums / chat rooms / etc.</li>
<li><strong>What are the incentives</strong> they will want? some people are motivated by being involved in something new, others are motivated by money (either immediate or delayed), some like the potential of being involved in the next 'Facebook', some like control, some like freedom of choice, some just like programming and if you put code in front of them they will make it better!</li>
<li><strong>What is the risk profile</strong> they are willing to take? If you are paying no money now, then the people you find either need to be self-funding, or low cost (e.g. living at home). Some people don't like risk, and will want a job that is fully paid and fully employed, others will like a bit of risk.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some things to consider (based on experience of a friend doing something similar)</p>

<ul>
<li>Establish a clear understanding of timeframe for work to be done. This is difficult when there is no money changing changes for the work done. Get 'buy-in' from your team on time frames and have clear understanding of what is to be delivered, when and to what standard (Consider using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Test Driven Development</a>).</li>
<li>Write a contract with each person for what they will be paid in the future (% of gross, options, equity, etc). Get some legal advice on this, even if it is a family friend to guide you who understands contract law.</li>
<li>Be careful about people from cultures that you don't understand or have experience with. I'm not meaning to be racist here, but just observing that different countries have very different attitudes to work, testing, following rules. </li>
</ul>

<p>Good luck!</p>
