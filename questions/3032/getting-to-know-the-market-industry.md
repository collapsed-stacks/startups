Just as @jdero answered, the **WorldBank** has all of the financial informations you need. It is very detailed and you can filter it in many ways, including period.

I know this for sure because my girlfriend works in a large bank and she uses the WorldBank's statistics to make reports and take financial decisions.

On the other hand, if you want to know about trends, I highly suggest **Google Trends** (http://www.google.com/trends/). The site is very helpful because interest or trends today can be measured in searches, and Google does a great job there.

There, you can write whatever company name (or basically anything) you want to learn about and it also allows you to filter the data in many ways.

These two tools, I believe, can resolve your query.

Hope this helps!

Robert

You may end up wasting a lot of your energy on this. Consider using a professional researcher, it is not very expensive to hire a freelancer through Elance or Odesk.

For less than a couple hundred you can hire the someone from places like India, the best ones are able to deliver amazing research using only public resources.

Then if you think it is worth, you can narrow your search and get top quality information from someone who does due-diligence for a bank or other institution where they have access to expensive information sources that are not publicly available.

Every cent invested in market research is a dollar spared in product development.
