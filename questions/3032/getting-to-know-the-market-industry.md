<p>Just as @jdero answered, the <strong>WorldBank</strong> has all of the financial informations you need. It is very detailed and you can filter it in many ways, including period.</p>

<p>I know this for sure because my girlfriend works in a large bank and she uses the WorldBank's statistics to make reports and take financial decisions.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you want to know about trends, I highly suggest <strong>Google Trends</strong> (<a href="http://www.google.com/trends/" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/trends/</a>). The site is very helpful because interest or trends today can be measured in searches, and Google does a great job there.</p>

<p>There, you can write whatever company name (or basically anything) you want to learn about and it also allows you to filter the data in many ways.</p>

<p>These two tools, I believe, can resolve your query.</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>

<p>You may end up wasting a lot of your energy on this. Consider using a professional researcher, it is not very expensive to hire a freelancer through Elance or Odesk.</p>

<p>For less than a couple hundred you can hire the someone from places like India, the best ones are able to deliver amazing research using only public resources.</p>

<p>Then if you think it is worth, you can narrow your search and get top quality information from someone who does due-diligence for a bank or other institution where they have access to expensive information sources that are not publicly available.</p>

<p>Every cent invested in market research is a dollar spared in product development.</p>
