<p>I was reading about the CORe program at Harvard - and the buzz is pretty appealing. Plus, the name recognition doesn't hurt as I'm a job search. </p>

<p>Have any of you had experience with this program? Would appreciate any thoughts, opinions or input.</p>

<p>Thanks!

<p>Lots of entrepreneurs never went to college</p>

<p>Lots of tech entrepreneurs never studied business</p>

<p>Lots of business people got their via accountancy, sales or law rather than MBA</p>

<p>Depends really, what you really want to do with your life! You say you are looking for a job. Do you want a job or do you want to be an entrepreneur?</p>
