I was reading about the CORe program at Harvard - and the buzz is pretty appealing. Plus, the name recognition doesn't hurt as I'm a job search.

Have any of you had experience with this program? Would appreciate any thoughts, opinions or input.

Thanks!

Lots of entrepreneurs never went to college

Lots of tech entrepreneurs never studied business

Lots of business people got their via accountancy, sales or law rather than MBA

Depends really, what you really want to do with your life! You say you are looking for a job. Do you want a job or do you want to be an entrepreneur?
