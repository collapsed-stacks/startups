There are different stages how to run and build a business. When you are just starting out, you are expected to invest a lot of time and money, i.e. your money.

Before a VC invested in your company you need to have customers and revenue. Before that, no one will realty invest in you.

That said, this is usually how it goes:

 - Friends and family: Ask family and friends to invest. This is how you get off the ground. The usual investment can be up to a 100k.
 - Angel investors: once your business plan has proven to have a future you can look for angel investors. The barrier is usually not so high as with VC's. Investment range is usually up to 1 million.
 - Series A: Here we are talking millions and usually VC's have knocked on your door already. Investment amount can be millions.
 - Series B: Welcome to the millionaires. Your business is really growing like crazy and you want to expand further.

I hope this gives some insight. I wish you all the success.

Its really not possible to just get funding. 

The people who get funding are generally:

1. In the Harvard/Stanford alumni social circle
2. Have lots of rich friends
3. Or have some sort of institutional backing already e.g. Quora

You are better off making another way and then funding out of pocket.
