<p>There are different stages how to run and build a business. When you are just starting out, you are expected to invest a lot of time and money, i.e. your money.</p>

<p>Before a VC invested in your company you need to have customers and revenue. Before that, no one will realty invest in you.</p>

<p>That said, this is usually how it goes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Friends and family: Ask family and friends to invest. This is how you get off the ground. The usual investment can be up to a 100k.</li>
<li>Angel investors: once your business plan has proven to have a future you can look for angel investors. The barrier is usually not so high as with VC's. Investment range is usually up to 1 million.</li>
<li>Series A: Here we are talking millions and usually VC's have knocked on your door already. Investment amount can be millions.</li>
<li>Series B: Welcome to the millionaires. Your business is really growing like crazy and you want to expand further.</li>
</ul>

<p>I hope this gives some insight. I wish you all the success.</p>

<p>Its really not possible to just get funding. </p>

<p>The people who get funding are generally:</p>

<ol>
<li>In the Harvard/Stanford alumni social circle</li>
<li>Have lots of rich friends</li>
<li>Or have some sort of institutional backing already e.g. Quora</li>
</ol>

<p>You are better off making another way and then funding out of pocket.</p>
