<p>I am considering to try out starting up/building a Software QA freelancing/consulting type of business. I have some skills in automation, and know at least java/javascript language.

<p><strong>1. My Location</strong></p>

<p>I am physically located in the US, in the south, where IT is not really that I could say, popular? I am very new in the US coming from Asia </p>

<p><strong>2. Why Hire Me?</strong></p>

<p><strong>3. What makes my service valuable?</strong></p>

<p>The cost </p>

<p><strong>4. Do I have a portfolio of happy customers?</strong></p>

<p>I don't know how and where to get this. Does this mean, my former employers?</p>

<p><strong>5. My set of success stories I can share</strong></p>

<p>I've been a consultant since 1994. Its profitable but not without its pains. If you plan on employing others, have you thought about cash flow? In 2014 I had two people on my books and paying them while waiting up to six months for my invoices from the client to be paid hurt. I managed it, but it was not easy.</p>

<p>Let's assume you start off as a one man band like I did... then what...</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Create a Company</strong> - Don't underestimate this. An incorporated company is treated legally speaking as another entity. If your services contribute to a clients loss and they hold you even partially responsible, they will either knock at your door, or, if you have a company, at the door of your company. If they sue and win, they will sue you or the company.  This can be the difference between you losing your laptop or you losing your home and personal credit rating for years. Note, if the law finds that you that negligence was not accidental, they can chase you personally, but if its discovered to be accidental, the company is held responsible, not you. Hence, the benefits of having a company as opposed to being unincorporated. (Update: Link to incorporate a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/limited-company-formation/overview" rel="nofollow noreferrer">UK Limited Company</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Get liability insurance</strong> - its not expensive, at least for me within the EU. Roughly speaking about $500 which covers me for non-physical labour (no lifting, not even moving of computer hardware) and covers me up to $5million per incident. If your client sues, it will cover legal fee's.</li>
<li><strong>Get a good accountant</strong> - The tax man has sniffed, touched, prodded, watched, slept with every trick in the books. A good accountant will help you be tax efficient (which is legal) and protect you from tax avoidance (illegal).</li>
<li><strong>Do a good CV/Resume</strong> - Your CV is your brochure that sells you. A prospective client will see many - if your CV does not sing from page one, don't think they'll look at page 2. Place your name, skills, URLs to examples of your work and recent education on top of first page. Work experience should follow. You want the client to know if you have the skill to help them before they even think about your experience. A CV should perfectly be one to two pages, certainly not four pages in length. Developers should read this blog post about interviews/resumes (CVs) by John Resig (the chap who created jQuery) <a href="http://ejohn.org/blog/project-based-interviews/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://ejohn.org/blog/project-based-interviews/</a></li>
<li><strong>Search for prospects</strong> - Everything from Linked to JobServe will contain adverts looking for people. The more flexible you are, the better your chances of getting a good contract. Highly skilled bad personality will not get you anywhere. I'm not excellent but I am good, and I do my best to get on with people. It has won me many opportunities. ** Do not pay ** for someone to find you clients (head hunters). Some recruiters charge and you might as well kiss your money good bye. I have never been asked to pay, but I have read about such.</li>
<li><strong>Branding</strong>  I created a brand and do not use my personal name (I have grand ambitions). A Q&amp;A here is worth considering <a href="https://freelancing.stackexchange.com/a/1014/11579">https://freelancing.stackexchange.com/a/1014/11579</a></li>
<li><strong>Reputation/References</strong>  In most countries, employees are guaranteed by law a non-negative reference (thus Employers can say you were a great worker, or just confirm you were an employee and provide no further detail). Service providers (implying consultants/contractors) do not have such luxury. Most clients I have worked with will provide unofficial references, but they don't have to. This is another reason why you should make an effort to get on with people - Anyone you work with during your time with a client can help you get your next job by saying you were a great person to work with, willing to help, knowledgeable etc</li>
<li><strong>Fraud</strong> Your CV contains private information and thus leaves you open to social hacks. In some countries, name, address, date of birth, photo and marital status are expected/requested. I provide name, postcode, phone number and email address only. The rest is available on request. <em>Never give bank details prior to signing a contract.</em> Always search the agency and/or your client online (it will also help you at interview stage to know as much about the client as possible). If they provide you with a company registration number, or a vat sales tax number, make sure those reference number correlate to the business they represent, and ensure the phone number/address they call from is one of their offices. Within the EU, you can check VAT numbers online at <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/?locale=en" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/?locale=en</a> and you can perform searches about a company in England and Wales at <a href="http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk</a> Use your favorite search engine to build a better picture of your agency, and the client. </li>
</ol>

<p><strong><em>Updated2017: Unemployment Insurance</em></strong>
In many jurisdictions, legally tax efficient moves can be made to reduce your deductions and thus increase your take home. You should check exactly what insurances you are paying as I recently discovered that registering self employed in Germany excludes you from making state pension and unemployment contributions. The issue that one can face is if you spend an extended period out of work and attempt to register for unemployment, you might find few doors open to you.</p>

<p><strong>A word about recruiters and contracting (consultancy) in general...</strong></p>

<p>Between you and the client will likely be a recruiter. Typically this is to ensure there is no employee/employer relationship. You will be responsible to pay your own taxes, health insurance, pension. The best you can expect from a client is a desk and a computer. Benefits are for the employees who get a salary. You won't get a salary, they will pay your invoice. You need keep that in mind when you feel secondary to team events (typically you will be excluded from team events unless you want to attend them for free and/or pay your way to be part).</p>

<p>A recruiter will love you for two reasons. 1) Good candidates are difficult to find so if they think you are good, they will not want another recruiter placing you at a client site. 2) Good candidates are difficult to find so if you say you are with five other recruiters, they realise five people are trying to sell you to a finite number of clients within 20 sq miles. They won't want to battle it out and thus work less hard to place you at a new client side.</p>

<p>If you get asked if you are with other recruiters, say you have sent your resume off to two others but as yet not had a reply. Never give details of an interview from one interview to someone at a different recruiting company. This will cost you opportunities. If a recruiter wants to know details about the competition, and they ask you, then this is a poor quality recruiter and rank them accordingly.</p>

<p>Oh! Remember, the client pays the recruiter to find a candidate. The recruiter, as nice as they can be, does not work for you. Don't forget that.</p>

<p>If you get to interview stage, the recruiter is likely going to say the client loved you. It might not be true - but you are told this so as 1) to gauge your interest in the job and 2) they don't want to pull a candidate from the client prior to the client having decided.</p>

<p>Flexibility is key. For the most part of my career I have been able to say yes to a job that was anywhere in Europe. If you are married with kids it becomes less easy for you to do this if the contract is for three or six months.</p>

<p>You will be a service provider, not an employee - you won't have rights (meaning you pay your own sick pay, you don't charge for lunch). You need remind yourself that - I've worked with contractors who cursed about their rights. Your hourly rate is high because it covers for possibilities like sick pay, long journey time to a fixed place of work (meaning the client should pay if you need go on business trips and you agree the remuneration terms between you).</p>

<p>If all this sounds like a headache, it can be. Don't consider the 'career' because of the money (rates of $300-$600 bucks an day are not unheard of in Europe for java programmer depending on experience). When you get your first invoice it can be rewarding. Your expenses can be high, but if you register your company for VAT (sales tax) you should be able to claim back your taxes (you need talk to an accountant).  Until recently, within the UK, I could claim back all fuel/train/hotel taxes, plus the taxes on hardware I needed for my work (iPad, laptops, cell phone etc). At 20% this adds up to a few thousand bucks tax credit.</p>

<p>Like any job, there are good points and bad points. I have had more than 20 contracts since 1994, the shortest being a few days, the longest being six years and I have lived in various parts of Ireland, UK, Belgium, Germany, Holland and Czech Republic. I met some great people but also lost out on some great times seeing family, nieces, nephews grow up.</p>
