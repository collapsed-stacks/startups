I have seen several companies having an academic collaboration with universities or specific professors, for doing research with the company or on the company's marketing/product strategies.

So, how do these collaborations really work, in terms of compensation and development?

**Do they pay the professors**, or is it that the company is getting research-driven advice and the professor is getting a published work (So, win-win?)

And how often do these companies apply the lessons learned from the research done through the collaboration?  [Real-world examples would help too]
