<p>I have seen several companies having an academic collaboration with universities or specific professors, for doing research with the company or on the company's marketing/product strategies.</p>

<p>So, how do these collaborations really work, in terms of compensation and development?</p>

<p><strong>Do they pay the professors</strong>, or is it that the company is getting research-driven advice and the professor is getting a published work (So, win-win?)</p>

<p>And how often do these companies apply the lessons learned from the research done through the collaboration?  [Real-world examples would help too]</p>
