I'm a programmer and I have started a company recently. I'm applying for SEIS for our company. One of the requirement of SIES application is to write what our company is doing with "Trading and activities".

I'm not sure what format is trading and activities get written on. Does anyone have any sample file, that can help me know what format and points I have to write for HMRC?
