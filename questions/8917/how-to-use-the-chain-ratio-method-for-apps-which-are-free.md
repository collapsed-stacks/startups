<p>I am developing the idea of a mobile application. I understand that to determine market size, the chain ratio method can be used.</p>

<p>Here is the chain ratio formula:  Q = n x q x p, where:</p>

<p>•   n = possible buyers</p>

<p>•   q = quantity purchased by an average buyer</p>

<p>•   p = selling price</p>

<p>I can determine <code>n</code> by calculating probable buyers. I can calculate <code>q</code> which would be <code>1</code>, since a user will download the app <code>once</code>. But, I am unsure on how to calculate p, the selling price.</p>

<p>The app itself is targetted for Android, Apple, and Windows, and will be free to download. Money will be made though ads and more. No in app purchases are planned. </p>

<p>As of this, I am unsure of what value <code>p</code> holds and since I cannot calculate <code>p</code>, I cannot apply the formula to calculate market size.</p>

<p>The app might be free, but you expect payment via ads. This implies indirect payment.</p>

<p>Thus - for price, insert how much you expect to generate from ads, per device.</p>
