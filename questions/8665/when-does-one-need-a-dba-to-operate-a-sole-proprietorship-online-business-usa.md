<p>I intend to launch a website that will hopefully make me money through advertising. I live in Oregon, USA.</p>

<p>I have decided that a sole proprietorship is the best structure for this business, initially at least. I am uncertain as to exactly when one needs to register a DBA (assumed business name).</p>

<p>For example, if I was making an online calculator with advertising at the side, could I title the page 'Wackadoodle Online Calculator', and simply give my name at the bottom of the page in a statement like 'This website is operated by Joe Bloggs'? Or would I need to register a DBA for the name 'Wackadoodle Online Calculator'?</p>

<p>Depending on state law, you typically need a DBA when you use an 'assumed name.' In Texas, I believe that means that you file a DBA form with the county (or counties) you are doing business in, and make public notice of your use of the assumed name.</p>

<h2>Entity vs Product</h2>

<p>A DBA, however, refers to the company (yourself) - the entity 'doing business,' if you will, which is different than the product line that entity-doing-business is offering. It would seem that your Wackadoodle Widget is really a product line offered by Yourself.</p>

<p>If, however, you said Wackadoodle Widget by WillsWebs, you would probably need to file a DBA for WillsWebs, so that people 'know' that WillsWebs means you, who is offering the Wackadoodle Widget 'product.'</p>
