I would like to write a book about a subject I'm particularly very interested on and I believe I'm well aware of.

I'm not sure on my abilities of writing but I'm pretty sure I know enough of the subject that many people could learn from it.

So, can I launch a book with little or no money getting at least a little profit from it? How would that be?

If so, I'm intended to do it for now and depending on the results I may invest more money in the future to reach a bigger audience with a newer version of the same book or even a whole new book.

<p>My girlfriend published an non-fiction e-book on Kindle using <a href="https://kdp.amazon.com/" rel="nofollow">Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing</a>. The service is pretty straightforward - you might find the fees a little high though. It's 30% if I remember rightly, but you'll be able to find out more in their FAQ <a href="https://kdp.amazon.com/help?topicId=A37Z49E2DDQPP3" rel="nofollow">here</a>)</p>

<p>As others have suggested, <a href="https://leanpub.com/" rel="nofollow">Leanpub</a> is a good service (friends have used it previously) but, from what I understand, they're more geared towards tutorial type books for developers, testers, project managers, etc.</p>

<p>Another option is to use a service like <a href="http://www.bookbaby.com/" rel="nofollow">BookBaby</a> - it allows you to publish and manage your book on multiple stores rather than just the one. It can be quite expensive though depending on the route you take, but they also offer a printing service for physical copies if you're willing to part with a bit more cash.</p>

<p>I've just done a quick Google search for other distribution services so it didn't look like I was biased towards a particular company and found <a href="http://janefriedman.com/2012/02/10/10-questions-epublishing/" rel="nofollow">this article - (10 Questions to Ask Before Committing to Any E-Publishing Service)</a> that might be of interest to you.</p>

<p>Hope this helps. Good luck with your book!</p>

<p>You might want to look at platforms like <a href="http://publishizer.com" rel="nofollow">publishizer.com</a> and <a href="http://leanpub.com" rel="nofollow">leanpub.com</a>, both of which provide ways to fund / test markets for books.</p>
