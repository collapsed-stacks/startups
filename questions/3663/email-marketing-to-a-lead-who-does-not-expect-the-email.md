<p>I have a plan to record 2-3 minute screencast of a potential client's website and how talk to them about how I can help and then send it to them in an email.</p>

<p>I am unable to find a mailing platform that will allow me to do such a thing. All of them are opt-in. Does anyone know where/how I can do this kind of email marketing?</p>

<p>I am not sending email to thousands of people at once, these are very thoughtful and personalized emails.</p>

<p>This is a form of cold-emailing. Look into the likes of <a href="http://www.salesforce.com" rel="nofollow">Salesforce</a>, <a href="http://close.io" rel="nofollow">Close.io</a>, or <a href="https://zapier.com/zapbook/email/#sort=popular&amp;filter=crm" rel="nofollow">another CRM</a> for that.</p>

<p>They allow you to send an arbitrary email to an arbitrary address, and track open rates and replies, while keeping follow-ups handy.</p>

<p>If appropriate, toss in an integration with an <a href="https://zapier.com/zapbook/email/#sort=popular&amp;filter=email-marketing" rel="nofollow">email marketing tool</a> to automate a follow-up or more when the user doesn't reply back. (It can take multiple cold emails to get a reader's attention.)</p>
