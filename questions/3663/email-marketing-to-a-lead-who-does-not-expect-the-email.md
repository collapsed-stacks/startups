I have a plan to record 2-3 minute screencast of a potential client's website and how talk to them about how I can help and then send it to them in an email.

I am unable to find a mailing platform that will allow me to do such a thing. All of them are opt-in. Does anyone know where/how I can do this kind of email marketing?

I am not sending email to thousands of people at once, these are very thoughtful and personalized emails.

This is a form of cold-emailing. Look into the likes of [Salesforce](http://www.salesforce.com), [Close.io](http://close.io), or [another CRM](https://zapier.com/zapbook/email/#sort=popular&filter=crm) for that.

They allow you to send an arbitrary email to an arbitrary address, and track open rates and replies, while keeping follow-ups handy.

If appropriate, toss in an integration with an [email marketing tool](https://zapier.com/zapbook/email/#sort=popular&filter=email-marketing) to automate a follow-up or more when the user doesn't reply back. (It can take multiple cold emails to get a reader's attention.)
