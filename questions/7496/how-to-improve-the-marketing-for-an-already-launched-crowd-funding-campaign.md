I made a mistake of launching campaign before spreading the word of my product thinking campaigns would be enough. How can I get more viewers and supporters to my campaign? Also I get a lot of offers to boost my campaign such as my-gigs.co and crowdonations.com, are these legit or fraud? Should I use these or create social media for my product? Thank you in advance.

Go for social media, target your core customers and try to build an email list of early adopters. Then keep them up to date of your progress. I would not use the services, in my experience they are mostly just spamming, without any value.
