<p>Recently we got a final report from a market research company that we hired to conduct some market research activities. We somehow feel that the data is plotted. Some questions draw sceptical conclusions. FYI, this was a quantitative market research activity. Almost all the questions were asked verbally. So apart from getting the raw data and performing an ms-excel analysis, what are the other ways on checking the data? </p>

<p>Many market research firms record their process to gain data; if you're concerned that they're potentially lying or not divulging everything, ask if they have video or audio recordings of interviews conducted. You can always say that you want to see the results for yourself; it's not a far-fetched request, assuming they do that. Not all firms do.</p>

<p>Otherwise get in touch with other people/companies that have used the research firm and get feedback on the firm from them. </p>

<p>Frankly this question could be "how can I tell if someone I don't know is honest with me?" and the answers are identical. Use your judgment, ask questions, and voice your concerns. If you tell them you're not sure that their data is correct and ask them to prove it, the worst they can do is not work with you anymore. But the best is to provide actual proof.</p>
