I need to get a document notarized by a US notary but I am not in US currently. Is it possible to get it notarized or I will need to visit US for it?

<blockquote>
  <p>Notarizing officers at any U.S. Embassy or Consulate abroad can provide a service similar to the functions of a notary public in the United States. It is also possible to have a document notarized by a local foreign notary and then have the document authenticated for use in the United States.  In countries that are party to the Hague Apostille Convention, this is a simplified process.</p>
