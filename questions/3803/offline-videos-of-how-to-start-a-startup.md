<p>for me I use <a href="https://www.vdyoutube.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer">VDyoutube</a> website, since it allows me to download from many website (youtube, Facebook, vimeo, vine, VK, twitter, instagram, vidme, twitch, ...etc )
for youtube it is easy, just add vd before the url and press Enter key.</p>
