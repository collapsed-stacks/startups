## I registered a California LLC in early December 2015. I have not yet filed the FTB Tax Voucher form. Do I file the 2015 or 2016 version of the form?

<p>My LLC-1 form was filed by the CA Secretary of State on December 4 2015. The only other form I have sent in is LLC-12, Statement of Information. I know that all California LLCs are subject to an annual $800 tax regardless of income, but there are a few things I am unclear on:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Do I owe $800 for the last 27 days of the year and then another $800 for the year of 2016?</p></li>
<li><p>Based on the answer to the previous question, should I file the 2015 or 2016 version of FTB 3522 (LLC Tax Voucher)?</p></li>
<li><p>Are there any other forms I must file immediately, either to SOS, FTB, or another agency?</p></li>
</ol>
