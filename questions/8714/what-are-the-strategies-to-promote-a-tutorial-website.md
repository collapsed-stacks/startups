It doesn't seem like the site is ready to be promoted yet.

For example, the "Listing Success" page acts like you've submitted a form even when you haven't. The "Listing Preview" page doesn't work. 

Also, there's only one tutorial location added. You can't actually view the tutorial as far as I can tell, so it seems that the purpose of the site is to show a distribution of where different tutorials are written? The site doesn't have any explanation of its purpose so 1) I don't know if I'm right about the purpose and 2) people won't be able to find the site through search engines by describing what it does.

If my understanding is correct, you need a large set of inputs, and it's unlikely that any tutorial authors or publishers would go to the effort to put their tutorials on there considering they don't even get a link out of it. Once you drive more content to the site, then you could reach out to individual bloggers or attract attention in other ways.
