So today I did soft launch of my SaaS tool by sending out to my mailing list.

36 opens (36% open rate). 18 clicks. 13 people signed up from older mailing list. 1 engaged.

21 opens (50% open rate). 11 clicks. 8 people signed up from latest mailing list. 4 engaged.

However, even the engagement was short lasting, after they created some jobs, they stopped. What is my next move here? I already emailed them to see if they need any help. Am I approaching this problem right?

<p>I don't understand your numbers, do you have 2 different mailing lists? </p>

<p>The first sentence says:</p>

<ul>
<li>36 opens (36% open rate) so that means you sent the email to 100
people.  </li>
<li>21 opens (50% open rate) so that means you sent the email to 42
people.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the first blast, you got 1 person to engaged (whatever engagement is for you) with your app out of 36 who read your email. </p>

<p><code>Engagement Rate = 2%.</code></p>

<p>Now apparently, either your leads in the second list are warmer, or you did a better job because out of 21 people 4 engaged.</p>

<p><code>Engagement Rate = 19%</code></p>

<p>am I correct? </p>

<p>Anyways, </p>

<p>There are 2 ways you can grow the engagement on your app:</p>

<p><strong>1. Get more people into your funnel</strong></p>

<p>Your second list has a 20% engagement rate, that's pretty cool. If you get 100 people into that funnel, you can project that you are expecting to see at least 20 engagements on your app every time you send an email. So the more people goes through your funnel, the more engagements you're going to get. </p>

<p><strong>2. Increase the engagements per user</strong></p>

<p>Say it's pretty hard for you to put more people into your funnel. Is it all lost? No! you have to make your users engage more frequently, thus your engagement rate will increase.</p>

<p>Reach out to the people who engaged with your app, say a week after they did, and ask them to do it again. If your app offers a benefit, tell them things like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We've observed if you do X at least twice a week, your results tend to
  go up by Z% It's been X days since you did Y.  <strong>DO X NOW BY CLICKING
  HERE</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Additionally, try reaching out to the people <strong>who did not open</strong> your email in the first blast with the messaging you used with the people in the second one, and see how they react. Probably you're going to get a couple more people to engage with your app.</p>

<p>Also, when sending out the email, Don't worry about times of day or day of the week kind of things. It doesn't matter at your volume. You're not going to get any statistical significance to draw any conclusion about your audience. It's just not worth it. Type up your email, proof-read it twice, have other people to read it, and then hit send whenever it's ready.</p>

<p>You can try to use some <a href="http://customer.io/" rel="nofollow">behavioral analytics software</a> to figure out what your users are doing. For example, a well known metric in the video games industry is the Exit Event Distribution. It's used to determine what things led a gamer to abandon their gaming experience. Then see if there's a problem, fix it and extend the playing time a couple of minutes or an hour. I strongly recommend you the book "<a href="http://amzn.to/1p2u4Fg" rel="nofollow">For the Win: How Game thinking can revolutionize your business</a>" It contains strategies to increase things like engagement. It's not specific for SaaS, but it may serve as a good stimuli for you. </p>
