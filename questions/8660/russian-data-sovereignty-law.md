So there's new law requiring a copy of personal data of Russian citizens in effect since September 2015. I can't read Russian, and Western press in languages I can read is a little vague on the actual details. Can anyone hence tell me if an encrypted periodic database extraction of just the Russian people's data, stored somewhere on a Russian server, is compliant?
