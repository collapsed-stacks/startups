I have a Ltd company in the UK. I am exploring expansion plans overseas. I am considering entering the US market.

What are the pros and cons with setting up a company in the US as a satellite office vs just exporting? Are there other options?

The company is service based. If more detail is required to provide a decent answer please comment and I will expand.

It depends on what your customer would prefer at the end of the day. Some people are comfortable with face to face engagement while others are comfortable using remote companies.  

If you feel that face to face engagement would improve sales then setting up a subsidiary or a new company in the USA may be a good option. You can register a company in the state of Delaware in the USA even if you do not live in the USA. They're pretty quick with the registration. 

Alternatively you can assess the success of trying to go the remote method which would be as easy as creating a separate website explaining exactly what you do and how you are able to provide your service remotely.
