<p>I'm a Computer Science undergrad. For our thesis next next year we're planning to make a web app that allows the user to upload a photo and the others will comment etc. Our idea is inspired  <a href="https://www.thehunt.com/" rel="nofollow">here</a> because we noticed that it's the common problem in our city. We like our thesis to be our stepping stone to be in a startup. And here's the thing we're afraid that no one will got interested on our work. Tips anyone? Should we continue it? </p>

<p>It will be easier to get people excited about your work if you can clearly define a value proposition. A good way to express it is the following (based on <a href="https://startups.stackexchange.com/a/1797/318">this answer</a>).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For (target customer)</p>
  
  <p>who (statement of the need or opportunity),</p>
  
  <p>the (product/service name)</p>
  
  <p>is a (product/service category)</p>
  
  <p>that (statement of benefit)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To figure out the value proposition you may have to do some customer validation. Think about your idea and build a hypothesis. Then you can create a survey and send to potential users and customers. That ways you will know better if what you are building will be useful. </p>
