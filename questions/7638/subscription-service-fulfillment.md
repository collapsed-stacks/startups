<p>I'm working on a project where we need to fulfill (ship) a subscription product.  This is a set of physical products (12), that need to be shipped in a particular order.  We ship out of Amazon and Shipwire warehouses.</p>

<p>Right now we're managing this by hand, but are there any software options that could manage customer onboarding for this, bill them, and handle the shipping?</p>
