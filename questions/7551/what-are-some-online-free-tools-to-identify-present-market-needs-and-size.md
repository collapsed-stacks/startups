<p>One of the tools is <em>google keyword planner</em>. I have an idea but I want to be sure about the market, if it exists, how big it is. Some demographic data would be great too.</p>

<p><em>Google Trends</em> is no help until data regarding the idea is a lot.</p>

<p><strong>Which other tools and techniques exist to find out more about market needs and size?</strong></p>

<p>Thanks. Cheers!</p>

<p>Creating landing pages for ideas can be good way to test markets. If you can find decent traffic from Google keyword tool, you can drive traffic to your landing page and see if your idea converts visitors to possible leads. </p>

<p>Running Facebook ads can be good and relatively cheap way to drive traffic as well.</p>

<p>Remember to A/B-test promise, pricing and other features that could affect on attractiviness of your idea.</p>

<p>At this stage, you really have to get creative in the way's you conduct your research. I use Twitters search to see if people are tweeting things such as "I wish there was an app for _____".</p>
