The value of my website lies in its content, namely comments. The problem is, without content I won't get any users, and without users I won't get any content.

Is there a service like Amazon Mechanical Turk that lets me pay people to comment on my site?

I posted a HIT on Amazon Mechanical Turk, but apparently it's against their guidelines to ask responders to do anything on a third-party site.

There are several sites where you can hire people to do this sort of thing.
One of the more popular sites is microworkers.com. It is very similar to Amazon Turks but less restrictive.

Might I suggest however that you may be going about it the wrong way.

If you are trying to create a community around a particular niche or passion, hiring random people to write the content will be fruitless unless those people are also passionate about the niche.

Where are the people in your niche hanging out online?
That's where you need to be. Invite people there to visit your site and participate. Offer incentives (perhaps a link back to something they love or some sort of endorsement).

In those communities are there advertising opportunities?
Look for advertisements in those communities. If you see ads that means you can likely advertise there.

Another (and probably the best) route is to run ads on Facebook.
You can find that here: facebook.com/ads

I've been using Facebook ads for years with great success.
They have virtually limitless targeting options in their ad system.

When you get inside the Ads manager, click on "Audience Insights".
This tool will give you a wealth of data about your target audience and will allow you to really zero in on the people you want to see your ads.

If you can give people some sort of added incentive (non-mon

<p>You can try <a href="http://www.fiverr.com" rel="nofollow">www.fiverr.com</a>, there are a lot of candidates that do this kind of work. But I don't recommend you to do it, try to attract your users then the comments will appear naturally.</p>

Announce a giveaway. There are a bunch of sites where you can post your giveaway. Too many to list here. Probably even a few that directly target the same market as you.

Give an iPad to the people that add the most content the first month, and smaller prizes to everyone that hits a certain threshold. Or, maybe give an iPad each week until you have the content you need.

Oh, and post a link to your giveaway here so that I can go and win a iPad. :)

Some services will sell you traffic redirected from expired domains and dummy websites. They can even send you targeted traffic, that is, people googling keywords related to your business. But this traffic is of low quality and you are unlikely to get high-quality content from them.

Narrow your market first if you want your users to reproduce the content (or to make comments). After you do that, try standard organic marketing: media coverage, word of mouth, ProductHunt.com, Hacker News, and so on.
