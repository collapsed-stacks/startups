<p>There are several ways:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Through online sites for startups:</strong> Sites like Angelist offer a great platform for connecting startups with prospective investors and employees.</li>
<li><strong>Startup fests/competitions:</strong> There are seed funding competitions happening all around the main hubs, which are Pune, Mumbai, Delhi( the whole of NCR) and Bangalore. These competitions generally consist of multiple rounds, and the final round consisting of two presentations (out of them one is the most important <em>startup pitch</em>). My startup raised a seed funding of 1 million through one such competitions. So, they are a great way to meet and interact with investors.</li>
<li><strong>Networking events:</strong> These events happen almost every weekend. You can have a look at them in meetup.com.  These networking events are a great way to meet prospective investors for your startup and also pitching your idea before a lot of experienced people in that particular domain.</li>

</ol>
