<p>There is a common advice that you should get paying customers as soon as possible. Besides the revenue this also validates the value that the product provides.</p>

<p>How does this apply to "Freemium" business model, where revenue is ad based?</p>

<p>It's probably not the only possible answer, but a common expectation for something ad-based that is "Freemium" would be to drop the ads upon paying.</p>

<p>Tip: be very wary about initially giving "too much" for free if your intent is to go Freemium. It's <em>a lot</em> easier to drop your price/offer more for free later than it is to increase your price/offer less without heavy backlash.</p>
