There is a common advice that you should get paying customers as soon as possible. Besides the revenue this also validates the value that the product provides.

How does this apply to "Freemium" business model, where revenue is ad based?

It's probably not the only possible answer, but a common expectation for something ad-based that is "Freemium" would be to drop the ads upon paying.

Tip: be very wary about initially giving "too much" for free if your intent is to go Freemium. It's _a lot_ easier to drop your price/offer more for free later than it is to increase your price/offer less without heavy backlash.
