<p>For a mobile app social network
like swarm or instagram, we are interviewing a bunch of people.</p>

<p>To understand what our product is, which customer segment does it address, is the idea a need or does it need pivot etc.</p>

<p>To answer such questions what is the minimum limit of interviews should one make? </p>

<p>There are two criteria which I'm looking.</p>

<p>1 - How different should the groups be?   (Engineers, high school students, university students, gamers etc.)<br>
2 - How many people will represent the general idea of that group?</p>
