For a mobile app social network
like swarm or instagram, we are interviewing a bunch of people.

To understand what our product is, which customer segment does it address, is the idea a need or does it need pivot etc.

To answer such questions what is the minimum limit of interviews should one make? 

There are two criteria which I'm looking.

1 - How different should the groups be?   (Engineers, high school students, university students, gamers etc.)   
2 - How many people will represent the general idea of that group?
