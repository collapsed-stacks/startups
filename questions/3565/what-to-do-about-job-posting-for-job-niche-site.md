I am creating a free service that lets employers post jobs.

I have a feeling that people might go crazy and post the same job over and over again so that it is more visible to the people that are looking for jobs. 

I have thought of many possible ways to limit this, but would like other people's thoughts on this.

I have one idea:

When a job gets submitted - check the text of the job for an identical match and if an identical match is found, prompt the user to ask if they would like to "bump" the identical match you found to being "new" again rather than re-submitting the same job.

Unless you currently have this issue, then I would not address the issue until it is an issue.
