I recently met the marketing head of a business which (whom) I would like to tie up with and offer my product and technology to them so that they can integrate in their product (website) by white-labeling it. They told me to send a business proposal (PPT) but I have no idea how it should look like. This is my first partnership attempt with other businesses. 

I googled a lot but only things I found are in essence 'How to pitch to an investor' instead of for a tie up.
Could anyone help me in this regard? Thanks in advance. 

PS: If my question is too vague, please guide me what details I need to add to make it precise.... I am new to this. I am afraid I couldn't even tag this question correctly.

You need a contract between yourself and this other company.  This is not an easy thing to do the first time.  I can give you a couple suggestions:

 1. Ask the company to provide a first draft of the contract.  They are more likely to have done this before and have the resources to get it done.  It will likely favor them so you'll need to read it very carefully and consider consulting an attorney.  Don't be afraid to negotiate any terms.

 2. Hire an attorney to draft a contract for you.  This will likely cost a couple thousand or so.

Focus your presentation on a few things:

1. Introduction - what is the product
2. How does it fit their current product offerings
3. How it helps their end users
4. What kind of longevity can you promise and how will you prove that

Then you can start to touch on price. Namely how much are you going to charge for the right to use your equipment. Emphasize while saying the price what the fiscal benefit is.

Then leave it to them to discuss.

I'm also not sure how you're searching but trying looking for "How to secure a licensing agreement" and other variants of that to get better results since that's essentially what you're after not an investor.
