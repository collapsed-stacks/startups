<p>I notice that Amazon had, and <a href="https://www.hostgator.com/affiliates" rel="nofollow noreferrer">HostGator has an affiliate model</a> where people who bring traffic get paid on an increasing schedule based on how much of the product they manage to get sold.</p>

<p>What is the advantage to structuring your payouts this way?</p>

<p>First thought: It motivates affiliates to sell more and more, since their next payout is always larger than their last payout.</p>

<p>Having affiliates sell more and more is good for the main company, of course.  And so long as the main company keeps making a profit on each sale (even if it gets smaller and smaller), they will stay happy.</p>
