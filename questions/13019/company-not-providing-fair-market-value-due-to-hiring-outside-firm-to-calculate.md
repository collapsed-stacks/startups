## Company not providing Fair Market Value due to "hiring outside firm to calculate"

<p>I work at a company and have the ability to exercise some shares at a 25 cent exercise price.</p>

<p>The FMV as of earlier this year was still 25 cents.</p>

<p>I asked HR what the current FMV price was to evaluate my possible tax impact, but they said they hired an outside firm to help update their valuation and are unable to tell me until that's done.</p>

<p>My question is - what do I do? I'm worried that since the company has been doing very well recently that their FMV will go up after the audit, thus increasing my AMT impact. Legally, if I send in a check to the company are they required to deposit it and I could state my FMV was 25 cents?</p>
