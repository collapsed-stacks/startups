<p>Recently a friend of mine told me about EU's new program for funding new innovative small businesses/startups.</p>

<p>I read about it in <a href="http://europa.eu/youreurope/business/funding-grants/eu-programmes/index_en.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">EU's website</a>, which provided useful brief on what &amp; how. It seems interesting.</p>

<p>Has anyone used the service here? what are the real benefits &amp; challenges you faced? How does it cover IT startups? Is there any mentoring / consultation services?</p>

<p>I'd appreciate any relevant bit of information / real-life experience.</p>
