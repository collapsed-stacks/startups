Recently a friend of mine told me about EU's new program for funding new innovative small businesses/startups.

I read about it in [EU's website](http://europa.eu/youreurope/business/funding-grants/eu-programmes/index_en.htm), which provided useful brief on what & how. It seems interesting.

Has anyone used the service here? what are the real benefits & challenges you faced? How does it cover IT startups? Is there any mentoring / consultation services?

I'd appreciate any relevant bit of information / real-life experience.
