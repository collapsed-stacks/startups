<p>Question is fairly straightforward. As a one man show I find it extremely difficult to brainstorm and bounce ideas around. It's as if I'm depending on two inner voices in order to attempt to make an unbiased decision.</p>

<p>How do you as a solopreneur/founder tackle this particular challenge? Are you using any particular software or methodology?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: to clarify, this is not in order to figure out if X business idea is actionable. I'm referring to an already established business, that's looking to further develop its product and strategy. This is what I'm referring to when asking  <em>"Are you using any particular software or methodology?"</em>  </p>

<p>I recommend reading James Altucher's writings on how to become an "idea machine." See <a href="http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2014/05/the-ultimate-guide-for-becoming-an-idea-machine/" rel="nofollow">here</a> as a starting point.</p>

<p>You're not going out enough. Got to local meetups and events you find interesting, be it from meetup.com or chamber of commerce events or what have you. Meet people and bounce ideas around. Also chat with random people when you stop somewhere for a coffee etc. -- you never know who you'll end up meeting.</p>

<p>Always have a pen and a small notepad handy for this purpose. Well, OK, I'm old school on that one... But the truth is I've yet to find a smartphone app that beats pen and paper when needing to write freeform notes -- plus, it forces you to process the notes when doing the data entry.</p>
