<p>I spent almost 2 years working (alone) on a really performant iOS/Android free app in the domain of social network.<br>
Technologies were complex and really new (autodidact), and concept very novative (existing nowhere) explaining the delay.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I discovered pretty late the <strong>Lean Startup</strong> philosophy, that's why I spent most of my time to really improve the product...bad :) </p>

<p>Now, there are people that are exciting about using the app, other that want some really specific features before they want to use it.<br>
An example of the features that some people really expect is the presence of a full user profile. Details for certains (due to the nature of the concept that doesn't really require it, as weird as it sounds), really important for others.</p>

<p><strong>In a "Buzz"-oriented mind</strong>, should I launch the product right now, and improve it along the way, or should I spent <strong>about one month</strong> to build the feature that some (not the major part) people expect.<br>
Indeed, we all know that nowadays, an app could easily be directly trashed if people don't use them at the very beginning (especially teenagers).<br>
On the other side, some potential concurrents could take the market before me...</p>

<p>The point is I really want to amaze the majority of users.<br>
However, I still can have a small community that would use the app with the actual features.</p>

<p>Any advice would really be appreciated. </p>

<p>Any reason you're hesitant to release what you've got other than a less than absolutely perfect first impression? Sounds like your beta testers think you're on to something.</p>

<p>Listening to <a href="http://releasenotes.tv/" rel="nofollow">Release Notes</a> and <a href="http://www.coreint.org/" rel="nofollow">Core Intuition</a> podcasts recently (both are about creating iOS apps and are geared towards indie devs), the advice seems to be to <strong>release quickly to see if your idea has <em>any</em> traction so you know before you throw too much time into an unsustainable idea</strong>. Sounds like you might be in danger of doing just that.</p>

<p>Or <strong>start by getting <a href="http://kk.org/thetechnium/2008/03/1000-true-fans/" rel="nofollow">1000 true fans</a></strong>. </p>

<p>[Channeling the advice I've heard and am taking...] Make sure your app has table stakes for your market <em>plus</em> a killer feature, and release the kraken. A month isn't bad, if you've got the cash and can make danged sure you cut bait and release if the month comes and goes, but you get the picture.</p>
