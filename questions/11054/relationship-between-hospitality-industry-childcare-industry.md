<p>I'm writting a business plan for a Nanny Program within my neighbourhood however a friend recently suggested instead of writing that i am part of the childcare industry which is really small where i am i should instead write that i am part of the hospitality industry. Is this true? Do I change my words or do i change them. My friend does have a few valid points of why childcare is within the hospitality sector such as childcare companies provides time management services &amp; that childcare companies are basically a hotel for kids(they are fed,taken care off,played with). </p>

<p>Your friend sounds like a marketeer for a cheap journal. Child care and Hospitality are not the same.</p>

<p>Just because you serve gas at the gas station does not mean you are in the auto industry.</p>

<p>Just because you sell milk does not make you a farmer.</p>

<p>Just because you look after kids does not imply you are in the hospitality industry. Changing diapers and cleaning tables are not the same. </p>

<p>Seriously... I suspect you will present your business plan to a bank or an investor. Respect them, their time and their money - if not, they won't respect you.</p>

<p>Write your business plan for the business you expect to be in. Your business goal is to make a profitable business - if your business plan cannot make that claim successfully without a colourful version of truth, then your business is on weak legs. You say "childcare industry is really small" where you are - this might dictate that there is no market for your business idea and thus, you should question if you have a viable business.</p>
