I have casual game - card solitaire.

I want to buy traffic (budget $1000). The goal is to get more installs.
Is it better to spend all the money in one day or split it (for example: 10 days by $100)?

What do you think? Can you share your experience and strategy?

Here has been my strategy in the past fo this type of situation...

First, you want to run some tests but the most important thing to think about is what you want to learn from those tests. Personally, I always tried to learn...

 1. Learn everything you can about your target, their demographics, the social media platforms they use, when they are online...
 2. You want to learn which ad platforms give you the most clicks and engagements.
 3. You want to test the bid sizing and keyword usage over time to improve your campaigns.
 4. You want to refine your message for better engagement.

--------------------

Now that you have the correct goals in  mind it is time to test these with different ad platforms. There are many platforms out there and each has its advantages with different market segments but some of the most popular are...

 - Facebook and Instagram ads
 - Google AdWords
 - Twitter Ads
 - LinkedIn Ads
 - Pinterest Ads

You want to decide which of these to test for your market and then set up accounts with each.

Then you want to setup daily limits for each of these platforms and give some estimate for the results you want from each (Don't worry about your predictions, they will get better over time, the only thing you know for sure is that your first estimates will be wrong, and that is ok).

------------------

Once you have run some test ads on different networks, with different ads targetted at different market segments, it will be a little clearer which Ad platform you should use. Then once you see which one get the most traffic it is best to focus your efforts on that entirely.

For example, if you were advertising a food app then you may find that Pinterest Ads are the best because they already have a lot of traffic that are people interested in recipes and food, but you may be wasting money posting Google AdWord ads.

---------------

Final Note: Remember, as with any other aspect of a startup the goals here is to run tests and learn for as cheap as possible. Then once you have learned enough to make a decision it is time to cut out all the less-than-optimal efforts and keep your marketing strategy as lean as possible.

Good Luck to you!

I was in the same dilemma when I had to buy traffic for Mobile CPAs. The better approach is to split it and test first. Also, know your target audience and the best time and day when they are most active on Mobile/Tablet so that you can have maximum hits.

I'm not sure about using 4-5 different companies for advertising our app. But I will say it's important to understand the audience your looking to get. Twitter for example is the most used app for getting news and information instantly and getting other people points of view, and with that being said you will also notice that most ads on Twitter featuring the app install ads are usually apps that aren't relevant to the individual who sees these apps on their time line. But Remember that these ads are from big companies and their goal is for every one to see rather focusing on a specific group or age focus. I highly recommend advertising your app on the YouTube platform, which is done through your Google Adwords account. And Twitter as well where consumers can install the app directly.
