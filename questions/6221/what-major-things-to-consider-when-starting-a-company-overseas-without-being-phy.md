<p>I have a requirement to set up a business entity somewhere overseas, with the following criteria</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I won't be physically present most of the time: I'll be running this company electronically (visiting only once or twice per year) until it grows to a sustainable size at which point I'll consider hiring staff and possibly moving myself</p></li>
<li><p>It must not be a so-called "tax haven" (there needs to be proper tax structures in place or it will cause problems for us locally)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So, with that in mind...</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Which would be the easiest (and cost effective), stable 1st world countries to consider for setting up such a remote company?</p></li>
<li><p>Would it be possible to do this without having a physical address in any of said countries?</p></li>
<li><p>If not, would it be possible to set up a "virtual office" through a third party?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>One of the problems I'm trying to solve relates to the very common challenge that entities in certain countries can't register as Google Merchants (<a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/table/3539140?hl=en" rel="nofollow">https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/table/3539140?hl=en</a>).</p>

<p>The other is that we need the company to operate under a more modern legal structure (such as under the EU, US, Oceanic, etc.)</p>

<p>I've looked into a number of options already, but laws keep on getting adjusted and updated to curb abuse - which is perfectly understandable - but unfortunately has the effect of blocking businesses wanting to set up foreign offices in a more cautious manner (i.e. by not hiring extra staff until it can be justified)</p>

<p>I've seen some other questions on this topic on SO, but they seem to relate more to "tax restructuring", which is not a consideration in our case</p>

<ul>
<li>The country involved would gain from the income tax (which we will gladly pay)</li>
<li>For us it would solve a great many problems</li>
</ul>

<p>Everybody wins.</p>

<p>This premise is incorrect:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It must not be a so-called "tax haven" (there needs to be proper tax structures in place or it will cause problems for us locally)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you're the sole proprietor of a company, the only reasonable country to incorporate in is where you live. If you've partners, the list of reasonable countries expands to any place where one of the partners is living.</p>

<p>Anything short of that is virtually guaranteed to attract a taxman's attention down the road - yours or your corporation's or both. When it does, they'll assume you're yet another tax evader and treat you as such. You'll get a very painful tax audit at that point.</p>

<p>There are hundreds of businesses and individuals in the US and probably the rest of the world that would love to be your remote partner. I have met many business partners through meet-ups and personal contacts. I know that is a little tough to do remotely, but is your best option.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if I am supposed to do this but I don't see any other way to contact you. If you will contact me at kdari.com, I will help you find a partner.</p>
