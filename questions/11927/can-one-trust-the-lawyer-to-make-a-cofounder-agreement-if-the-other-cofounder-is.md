<p>Is it foolish for one cofounder to trust the lawyer to get the startup incoporated and create a cofounder agreement if the other cofounder is going to pay for the lawyer?</p>

<p>I am at the point where it might have to back out of the startup if I will need to spend the money on a lawyer.</p>

<p>Since I am told by more that one person that 95% of start ups do not go on to succeed, I have no interest in spending money on it.</p>

<p>I don't want to be at risk so unless I find a solution, I do not know how I can proceed.</p>

<p>Perfectly sensible. Just see to it that the agreement is mutual rather than one-way, i.e.:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cofounders agree that [...]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rather than things like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[SingleParty] agrees to [...]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Aside: you really need to trust your cofounder, else things are pretty much guaranteed to go wrong down the road.</p>

<p>No, it is not foolish.  You will eventually have to sign off on the agreement anyway - so if it seems fair and reasonable, simply move forward. If not, ask for a revision to your liking or walk away.</p>

<p>But it seems you have enough doubt to question your cofounder before you even start. This should be a red flag, as one of the major reasons for startup failure is a falling out between founders.</p>

<p>This comes down to you - whether you trust the person or not.  If not, you could be setting yourself up for failure.  Good luck.</p>
