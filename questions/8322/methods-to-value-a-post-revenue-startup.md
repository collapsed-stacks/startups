I'm looking for the best ways to calculate the valuation of a company that is generating half a million dollars of revenue per year. 

More info: Recurring revenue business model (Software Product) with 35% of net income.

The goal is to have the right numbers so we can negotiate with investors for the first time properly.

Let me know what other info/data I should take in consideration.

A copy from my self from a similar question:

I will give it a try, but this is only harsh university gibberish:

There are a few points which really matter, while evaluation startups:

 - **Market**: It the market attractive (for your investor)? Do other VCs or investors already invest into that market? Think of it as competition.
 - **Reputation of the founder**: how experienced are you guys in founding a company? have you already failed (and that's a good thing, because you already experienced this process)
 - **Innovation and security**: How strong does your product differs from previous approaches? Are you guys able to secure or patent your idea?
 - **Traction and scaleabilty**: How does your customer group adept your product? How many users do you have? how strong are you growing per invested $?
 - **Revenues and proof of concept**: Have you even sold a unit? Do you reach your own goals, so your further prediction are more valid?

The thing is, I can't tell you how to rate your company this way, but least, if you can answer these questions in a profound and positive way, you will have bright future.

Normally, the investor rates you on your pitch and these questions.

I also found this link, but i can't tell you how reliable it is:

1. How much have you currently raised? 
2. How much has it cost you (cash) to build the current technology? 
3. How many users do you have? (What is the life time value of the user: how much money will you make off of 1 customer in the lifetime of the business? Multiply that by the current amount of users you have) 
4. How much revenue have you generated? 
5. How fast are you growing (margin wise %)?

Multiply that by 4 and that's your valuation.

For a company this size, it is quite likely to be valued based on revenue or profit alone; most likely there are not significant assets (PPE) or other value to be considered, such as founder reputation and "innovation level" as previous comments mentioned.

Here are three methods that I would suggest **averaging** for a final rough approximate value starting point:

  - **Annual Revenue**: Simply the value of your last 12 months revenue.
  - **Annual Net Operating Profit**: Multiply total annual net operating profit by the number of years the business has been operating (e.g. if you are in business for 2 years, calculate 2x annual net profit) 
  - **5-Year Net Cash Flow**: Take the current monthly net cash flow (free cash), and multiply by 60 months.

Based on the few details you mentioned and if you have been in business 2 years, your business might be worth $475k to 575k.

Here are my two cents to assess the value for each potential buyer

- What is the cost for the potential buyer to acquire a new customer?
- What is the incremental revenue per new customer expected by the potential buyer?
- What are the synergies expected by the potential buyer?

I think this is a sufficiently difficult task (and likely outside your field of expertise) that you should not attempt it yourself. Instead, consider the following options.

1. Evaluate comps. Find funded deals similar to yours.
1. Hire a professional appraiser.
1. Let the competition make bids.
1. Ask an industry contact or advisor.
