<p>I'm looking for the best ways to calculate the valuation of a company that is generating half a million dollars of revenue per year. </p>

<p>More info: Recurring revenue business model (Software Product) with 35% of net income.</p>

<p>The goal is to have the right numbers so we can negotiate with investors for the first time properly.</p>

<p>Let me know what other info/data I should take in consideration.</p>

<p>A copy from my self from a similar question:</p>

<p>I will give it a try, but this is only harsh university gibberish:</p>

<p>There are a few points which really matter, while evaluation startups:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Market</strong>: It the market attractive (for your investor)? Do other VCs or investors already invest into that market? Think of it as competition.</li>
<li><strong>Reputation of the founder</strong>: how experienced are you guys in founding a company? have you already failed (and that's a good thing, because you already experienced this process)</li>
<li><strong>Innovation and security</strong>: How strong does your product differs from previous approaches? Are you guys able to secure or patent your idea?</li>
<li><strong>Traction and scaleabilty</strong>: How does your customer group adept your product? How many users do you have? how strong are you growing per invested $?</li>
<li><strong>Revenues and proof of concept</strong>: Have you even sold a unit? Do you reach your own goals, so your further prediction are more valid?</li>
</ul>

<p>The thing is, I can't tell you how to rate your company this way, but least, if you can answer these questions in a profound and positive way, you will have bright future.</p>

<p>Normally, the investor rates you on your pitch and these questions.</p>

<p>I also found this link, but i can't tell you how reliable it is:</p>

<ol>
<li>How much have you currently raised? </li>
<li>How much has it cost you (cash) to build the current technology? </li>
<li>How many users do you have? (What is the life time value of the user: how much money will you make off of 1 customer in the lifetime of the business? Multiply that by the current amount of users you have) </li>
<li>How much revenue have you generated? </li>
<li>How fast are you growing (margin wise %)?</li>
</ol>

<p>Multiply that by 4 and that's your valuation. </p>

<p>For a company this size, it is quite likely to be valued based on revenue or profit alone; most likely there are not significant assets (PPE) or other value to be considered, such as founder reputation and "innovation level" as previous comments mentioned.</p>

<p>Here are three methods that I would suggest <strong>averaging</strong> for a final rough approximate value starting point:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Annual Revenue</strong>: Simply the value of your last 12 months revenue.</li>
<li><strong>Annual Net Operating Profit</strong>: Multiply total annual net operating profit by the number of years the business has been operating (e.g. if you are in business for 2 years, calculate 2x annual net profit) </li>
<li><strong>5-Year Net Cash Flow</strong>: Take the current monthly net cash flow (free cash), and multiply by 60 months.</li>
</ul>

<p>Based on the few details you mentioned and if you have been in business 2 years, your business might be worth $475k to 575k.</p>

<p>Here are my two cents to assess the value for each potential buyer</p>

<ul>
<li>What is the cost for the potential buyer to acquire a new customer?</li>
<li>What is the incremental revenue per new customer expected by the potential buyer?</li>
<li>What are the synergies expected by the potential buyer?</li>
</ul>

<p>I think this is a sufficiently difficult task (and likely outside your field of expertise) that you should not attempt it yourself. Instead, consider the following options.</p>

<ol>
<li>Evaluate comps. Find funded deals similar to yours.</li>
<li>Hire a professional appraiser.</li>
<li>Let the competition make bids.</li>
<li>Ask an industry contact or advisor.</li>
</ol>
