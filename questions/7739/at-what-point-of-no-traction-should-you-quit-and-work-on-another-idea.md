<p>‘Pivot’ is a common word in the startup world. It means diversifying from your original plan when that fails to impress customers. A startup should keep in mind the following as indices so that they can pivot at the right time.</p>

<p>Don’t Take the Decision Alone: If you think you need to pivot, ask others in your team whether it is the right time to pivot. Taking decisions after consulting experienced executives or startup consultant also help to pivot in the right direction since you would be in a highly competitive market.</p>

<p>Know What The Customers Want: You might think that your idea is the next big thing to change the world, but if the customers don’t think so, you simply must accept that there is something wrong in your idea. This is the time when you should pivot and re-think about your strategy.</p>

<p>Getting the Product Right: If during the development phase, you feel that there is something wrong with the product, you should pivot immediately.</p>

<p>In one line, Customers, problem, solution, technology and growth are the five indicators for pivoting.</p>

<p>I've written a blog post about this as well: <a href="http://veloztechform.com/blog/when-to-pivot-your-startup/" rel="nofollow">When to Pivot Your Startup?</a></p>

You have asked a question that has no single correct answer. There are many many answers.

For me "working on something else" has at least 2 meanings. One is to bail, give up and get out. The other is to drop the current idea, product or what you are currently working on. 

I will try to list some of the more obvious reasons. but they are in no particular order.

1) One is money. You have run out of it and can't get any more.

2) When you no longer believe in your idea for a product or service.

3) When your product or service is obsolete

4) When something in your personal life becomes more important. You have sick child, wife or relative.

5) When your idea is so criticized that you give up on it.

6) When a competing similar idea beats you to market.

7) When your idea can no longer be profitable.

8) When you receive a job offer that you can't turn down.

The above are generalities for which may cause your decision to shut down but they can also cause you to redouble your efforts. You probably know that many successful businesses have had multiple failures before they achieve success. Those that don't are lucky.

Pivoting is something different. It can be an earlier or simultaneous decision with that of "working on something else".

I found some good information on pivoting from the answer to another post. 
https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/3066/pivots-vs-changing-course-what-is-the-difference?rq=1  

I also found a similar question. https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/3131/how-do-you-decide-when-to-pivot-and-when-to-bail-for-a-new-destination?rq=1

Pivoting would occur when you change how would accomplish your goal, as opposed to giving up or going somewhere else. One way of saying it would be its similar but different. 

As with "working on something else", the decision on pivoting comes at various times. Here is a list of some examples.

1) You have worked it out in your mind that the current course won't work, but your new idea will.

2) The material you had planned on using is no longer available.

3) Your idea was stolen.

4) You have to figure out how to make it cheaper to be able to sell.

5) You need to put more differentiation between your envisioned product than an existing one.

Assuming you are the one in charge of your startup, your decision needs to made carefully. Each choice can have powerful effects.

I know this a generic answer. If you will add more detail to your question, I'll be better able to answer it.
