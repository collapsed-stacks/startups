I own a small, been-in-the-family-for-years sort of restaurant business, and I'm looking to drum up some business, and appear fun and inviting to patrons. To that goal, I've thought about decorating my storefront and interior with some holiday themes for the month.

How can I accomplish that general feeling without appearing to favor any religion in particular? The obvious counter-example of what I'm looking for is if I had a Christmas tree in my window, since that would (I assume) favor Christmas over anything else.

My primary goal is simply not to offend anyone. I'd like not to associate with any particular holiday or religion if possible, but if something is on-the-bounds but generally accepted, I'd be okay with that too.

Would it be acceptable for me to put lights up? I've heard that white lights are okay, but other ones make it seem too Christmas-y. That seems pretty sad, since color is a lot more exciting, but I can live with that if need be. What other decorations are universally accepted?

I've also thought about printing up some new menus or inserts that have wreaths or other similar depictions on the borders, but I'm not sure whether that would be too Christmas-y or not.

I'm also thinking maybe fake snow is a nice and universal decoration? I'm just not sure how much I can do of that before it gets boring and less fun. It seems like a subtle accent, which is great, but I think I'm looking for something a little meatier.

To be clear, I'm not looking for a shopping list. I'm just wondering what I can do big-picture.

Maybe I'm just overthinking this all. That's quite possible, and I could accept that.

Speaking as someone who doesn't celebrate Xmas, I don't think anyone would get offended at the usual "Happy Holidays / Merry Christmas" decorations with the colored lights, tree, Xmas paraphernalia, etc. Winter is fun for everyone and the decorations are part of it. The token Hanukkah menorah and a Kwanzaa mention tend to look a bit forced, though, and I guess that's what you're trying to avoid. So, my two cents:

Winter and New Year themes can be pretty secular. So skip the Santa hats, colored lights, fake wrapped gift boxes, reindeer, wreaths, and trees, etc.

Stick with New Year / Snow / Winter (snowmen, snowflakes, "Happy New Year" paraphenalia, maybe white lights) and I think you'll accomplish your goals of decorating with a winter holiday theme that doesn't invoke a specific holiday.

The phrase "Happy Holidays" still seems religious to me, even if it doesn't specify a specific holiday. I'd stick with "Happy New Year" if you really want to avoid any hint of religion but still have an upbeat message.
