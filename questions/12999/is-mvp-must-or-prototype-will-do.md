<p>Before raising capital is MVP must or a prototype will do?  And what if you even don't have enough fund for getting the product into the market. And is there any loan or organizations which help the early stage startups?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>in my view MVP and prototype are essentially the same thing.</p>

<p>If you create an MVP or prototype before you seek funding is up to you. There are investors out there who will invest seed funding into a company with a solid experienced team, research, evidence and a plan for their money.</p>

<p>If you have an MVP or prototype then you have more evidence that you can achieve what you are saying to an investor and obviously your value as a company will increase.</p>

<p>There are organisations that help early stage start ups. They are usually called Accelerators and you get them for many different business stages.
a Pre-seed accelerator would be what you are looking for if you do not have an MVP or any funding. These accelerators will have standard terms over how much funding you get for what percentage of your business and will be attached to investors or institutions who can help you with further funding if necessary.</p>

<p>Many of them have teams with advice on hand and mentoring also.</p>
