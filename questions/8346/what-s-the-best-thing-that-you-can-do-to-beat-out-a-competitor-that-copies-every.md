<p>Sometimes it's major features and sometimes it's little things like our email copy. Much of it is blatant copying and it is making it more difficult to standout. </p>

<p>Whomever said that imitation is the highest form of flattery was probably the guy who was doing the imitation.</p>

<p>There are other forms to stand out than technical features. </p>

<p>What if you were in the opposite side of the table, having to copy cat in order to become relevant?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This subject is addressed in a book called BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY.</p>

<p>You have plenty of options that could be innovative and hardly difficult to follow, like <strong>culture innovation</strong> (making yours employees working harder and smarter than theirs employees), <strong>financial innovation</strong> (investing money in areas that give you huge advantages) or even <strong>business/strategy innovation</strong> addressing your customers in an unprecedent and pleasant way.</p>

<p>So think more widely trying to figure out how your business can be better than theirs and suddenly their product will become irrelevant no matter how similar it is to yours.</p>
