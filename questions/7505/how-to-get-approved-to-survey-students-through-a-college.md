I've been talking to the institutional review board at my school about sending out a survey (short google forms survey) to students and faculty for research feedback on time-management apps that will help students improve performance. It has been REALLY slow; literally a few weeks between each response. It doesn't look so good. I feel they're not going to approve it at this point.

I'm not sure if I'm going the best route for what I'm trying to achieve. The students are local, and the investors are local, so I feel that this is the best proof of concept. It won't feel like some incentivized online survey. I'm wondering if the IRB is the best route or if there's a department that focuses more on cases like this. How do I get approved?
