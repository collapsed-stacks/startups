I have 1 year of expenses saved up, though 4 months is my goal for finishing my prototype.

I'm building what is essentially a social media sharing site, but I have a very unique piece of tech that basically will ether make or break me. I have an idea already for revenue streams, and I can under cut my existing competition. I can also see this being something a large competitor would want to buy.

I've vetted the idea with colleagues friends and I've had nothing but positive feedback. My prototype will launch with at least 2 revenue streams.

It's a full on Web app, lots of moving pieces, lots of microservices. I'm a developer and I have 7 years experience full stack, including devops, scalable architecture, etc. The only thing I have to hire for is design at this point.

I have a small prototype but it's been difficult to work on it more than a few hours after work. I need a fire under my ass I think. The unique tech I'm building hasn't been done by my major competitors, I'm in a race to get this out there before it's too late.

Am I crazy for just quitting? I find it difficult to code at work, I will likely get fired anyway because my performance is suffering because all I can think about is my app.

My worst case scenario would be running out of money and having to move back in with my parents.

I was in an almost identical spot 6 months ago. Took the plunge and haven't regretted it for a second. I have learned more through my own efforts in the past 6 months that I learned in total over years of working. Since I took the plunge and started interacting with other entrepreneurs and sharing my knowledge I have received many job offers (of which I politely declined) and I really feel like even if this venture fails I will be in a much better position to rejoin the workforce and will have more to offer.

You seem to be in a good spot. Take the plunge, work harder than you ever have, learn new things every day and love life!

For two years I was thinking to build my online business. Two years spent standing at the edge thinking whether to jump or not. Even though I closed the business after four years, I never regretted the day I jumped. The experience and the journey worth it. Returned to the workforce stronger that ever.

Jump my friend!

I really feel the same. I think you are on the right path. Since you have the money to survive, don't hesitate.

Given your situation and keenness to build, its better that you take some dedicated full time off. 

If money is a concern, try seeking some side projects you can generate some monthly income from.

What have you got to loose?

what have you got to win?

I suspect you are concerned about failure - but if you compare it to programming, you'll know that success and failure are not binary.  There are people who dream and who don't jump. There are people who dream, jump, fall and walk away rubbing their wounds. There are people who dream, jump, fall, get up and do it all over again.  Then there are people who dream, jump, fall, learn, and get up and go further next time.

My brother ran a bar/restaurant for 28 years before it went bust. Do you consider his venture a success, or a failure?

Let's say your experience takes you a year down the road and you realise it's just not a good fit for you and your life - What have you learned? (Short answer: LOTS).

I fell into contracting/consulting in 1994 - I've always had grand ambitions - I'm not there yet, I've learned not to repeat, but learn from past mistakes and at 45 years old, I actually think I'm on the right track this time. I started a six month self-sponsored project (app) 18months ago and I am about 95% finished. Its not easy, its sometimes painful, but I don't regret it. 

Some thoughts that you should at very least consider going forward:

Best of luck!
