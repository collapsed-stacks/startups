Last summer I came up with an idea for an app game. I decided to develop it myself so (coming from Java) started to learn objective-C and programs such as Xcode. During the summer I wrote a functioning pre-alpha version of the app (lacking artwork) but I was unable to finish it before the holidays ended (I've written about 50% of what in my eyes could be considered as the first version of the final app).

Currently I am working on a new project and since this new project falls better into my fields of interest (finance, trading), I've given up on the app.

But I would love to finish it as IMHO I think it could be a huge success. Therefore I've decided to search for a developer which is willing to finish (or rewrite) the app and split the profits. This means that I'm not willing to invest any money into it. Rather I would like to split profits 60/40 (60 for the developer).

I have a few questions regarding this:

- Is this a fair profit sharing ratio?
- How and where should I search for developers?

Especially the second question left me clueless: posting an 'ad' on a big site could result in some sort of adverse selection of developers. Likewise, I think that approaching individual developers that are both good and motivated could be rather difficult: should I target professionals, student-developers, freelancers, amateurs? I would like to have a local developer (for 1-to-1 meetings) but I also want the developer to be *skilled* (in developing apps/designing artwork) and *highly motivated*/*enthusiastic*, so with such a geographic restriction it might be hard to find one.

Any suggestions, comments, criticisms are highly appreciated.

<p>The profit sharing ratio seems fair. Don't target professionals or freelancers. </p>

<p>First you need to know <strong>who</strong> you need. I would advise searching nearby university students who are in one of these categories: </p>

<ul>
<li>Engineering</li>
<li>Gaming</li>
<li>Global Game Jam</li>
<li>Esports</li>
<li>Science fiction</li>
<li>Entrepreneurship</li>
</ul>

<p>These guys would know whats up, want to learn new stuff, improve themselves and are most likely to be interested in your project. Don't look for someone who is skilled, they probably have their own projects, might leave your project. Look for someone who is highly motivated, who can learn how to finish the project semi-autonomously. </p>

<p>How to find them?</p>

<p>Your local universities probably has a facebook group, meetup, eventbrite etc. Attend a few events, write in a few groups, if there is someone you will either find them or reach out to someone who knows that person.
