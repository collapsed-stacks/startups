<p>I'm starting a crowdfunding platform and having some trouble figuring out what type of business to make it. The purpose is to raise money for charity.</p>

<p>The transactions will flow as follows...</p>

<p>For every donation made:</p>

<p>-4% service fee goes to my website. This 4% is taken from every donation made through the website as a fee to keep the site running.</p>

<p>-After this 4%, the remaining 96% of the proceeds will be split in half and allocated to 2 additional parties</p>

<p>-So the user makes a donation, and PayPal splits it 3 ways and sends it to 3 different parties: website - 4%, fundraiser (to cover fundraising costs) - 48%, charity - 48%)</p>

<p>I have a few business forms in mind, but having trouble choosing the right one for this... </p>

<ul>
<li>non-profit would be ideal </li>
<li>LLC (C corp or S corp?) </li>
<li>sole proprietorship (just to get the business started?) </li>
</ul>

<p>Be wary that 4% is not enough if you factor in the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/help/fees" rel="nofollow">payment processor fees</a>.</p>

<p>As to the business form, there's no right or wrong answer as long as your own assets are protected by limited liability. If you believe non-profit would be ideal (and I agree, since non-profits like to do business with each other), then go with that.</p>
