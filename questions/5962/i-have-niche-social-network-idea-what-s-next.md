I have a niche social network idea that targets a specific audience, there are approximately 18.5M of them around the globe so I guess there is a potential opportunity here. There are some competitors out here but I feel I have a better way of approaching the idea.
But for now I feel like I'm lost, I don't know where to begin. These are my main concerns:

 - Should I use a social networking software or come up with my own? My knowledge in programming is limited and for now I don't have enough money to hire professionals to do that.
 - As I said I don't have the cash flow for now, is that something that is going to stop me, or there is a chance to fight?

My question:

>  In the light of these facts, what are realistic steps that I should take?

Maybe the first thing you should do is a SWOT. Find your Strength and Weaknesses and compare the opportunities and the threats of your project. Then try to focus on your strength and find someone to compensate your weaknesses. Convince someone of your idea with the opportunities and how you guys will handle the threats.

Also outline your business: What is the difference between your users and customers? Whats your value proposition? Get your self a list of your Key Partners, Key Resources and Key Activities. (for more google canvas business model)

Q1:
If you have a software which fits your needs, take it! Developing a own is always more expensive, takes time, rises risks etc. (Of course this case is only true, there is an real alternative.) In your case outsourcing is the only thing left or find a developer for as co-founder. Learn coding would take you at least a year until you have the experience to write own applications and social media projects are quite heavy on logical content and big data (in other words very complex).

Q2:
Cash flow for now? Either you mean you have no idea for monetization of the project, then stop and find one. Or you mean you have no income (your private situation). Then ask your self, how long can you hold that state, do you have backup from your family for your decisions and are there alternatives like part time jobs etc. I'm also on an idea. To pay the designers, I do freelancing as a project manager and web developer.

<p>There is always a chance to fight. That is what a startup is about. Remember there is no real blueprint for how to start a startup.</p>

<p>Personally, I would recommend learning to code before looking for a partner unless you are good friends with or have worked with someone who can build a small alpha version for you. If you don't immediatly have someone that can help you you should take sometime and learn how to code. Yes, it will take a while but you by no means have to 'master' it. I recommend Ruby on Rails for this project. In the meantime, you should be talking to you potential users, getting into their mind, finding out what they 'truely' need so you can build an ideal product.</p>

<p>Learning to build a project like this could take two weeks. It took me a month to wrap my head around rails, but I had already built my first project within two weeks of starting to learn. This was the route I took:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://railsforzombies.org/" rel="nofollow">Rails for Zombies</a>. Just jump head first into rails.</li>
<li>Mackenzie Child's Youtube channel. He has a great 12 in 12 challenge where he builds things like blogs to pinterest clones.</li>
</ol>

<p>After you do this, build a basic working version of your site. Keep a list of a couple features you'd like to add and keep learning to add them. This is when I would spend the energy trying to find a partner or money to create a MVP (Minimal Viable Product). </p>

<p>If learning to code is not something you envision yourself doing, another option is to use Wordpress. There are many ways you can configure wordpress to create a viable social media site. A plugin that immediately comes to mind is <a href="https://buddypress.org/" rel="nofollow">BuddyPress</a>. It will enable you to create a social media network using wordpress.</p>

I have a niche social networking idea too and believe that if it offered similar functionality to compete with major and global platforms such as Facebook, Twitter etc. then it would still capture and audience of several million people with almost guaranteed shelf life that would ensure it's potential to maintain resilience to any alternative networks. This is primarily due to user 'ownership' of this brand which would be unique to the audience. I began to do more research into developing a simple prototype which would allow people to register, complete a personal profile, share posts to public or private groups, connect with other members and control what is seen, shared or filtered across the network and beyond (e.g. searching on Google etc.). I decided not to invest more time on this particular project due to the amount of investment and commitment that would be needed if it were to be as successful and sustainable as I had anticipated. However, if I really felt like my network needed to be developed even if it meant someone else or another company doing this and profiting from the idea then I'd choose an off-the-shelf network that simply would only give me the option of choosing a brand, logo, colour scheme and ways to invite people to register on the network, because the need for the intended audience of people to be connected for the purpose of achieving a common goal would be more important to me than delivering a new software solution and earning money from the investment.

To help you on your journey, I would like to offer these points of advice. I would be more than delighted to learn of your successes and achievements in the future if your work pays off in developing a niche social network. Good luck!

Fundamentally, running a social network and owning all of the rights to every aspect of the product, is not possible to achieve without serious or long-term investment into the development and maintenance of the network, for the lifetime of it's existence and potentially beyond, if and where concerned with information that may be archived or distributed in accordance with the various laws in existence or planned for the future. Using an off-the-shelf model supplied by a reputable company that offer anyone the ability to run a customised network with options to change the appearance and set various rules of the network using existing controls and on/off switches is what you would be advised to do if you are not able to register your own company or purchase the required licences or software programs to ensure privacy of data or protection of identity of any users. Otherwise, it would be impossible to avoid risk of running into serious legal battles being taken against you without any warning. You see, any individual with the right to hold you accountable for the information you are required by law to process and secure in line with personal property and data protection legislation, could sue you without limits, if you operate solely or without the relevant legal protection that limit your liabilities and protect your investment!

Lessons.

 - PRIVACY and SECURITY of all information must be guaranteed at all times and be implemented to the standards that meet the requirements of data protection legislation (Data Protection Act 1998 in Britain for example) and other relevant laws. If not, then any personal information of any members that is easily accessed or leaked without the intention of stealing it would instantly breach the rights of the individual and lead you into serious trouble with the potential of imprisonment or unlimited liability where you'd basically be sued way more than you'll ever earn in your lifetime... trust me, I'd prefer not to bother setting up my own network without being registered as a limited company to ensure limited liability and also investing into existing software applications that meet all of the necessary laws that takes away your own responsibility for the information of individuals! 
 - Don't reinvent the wheel. There are many open source social networking platforms that provide all of the basic scripts and programs on which to develop customised networks that make much more sense than starting from scratch as even if your own ideas do not entirely match those of existing networks, there are many basic sets of rules that feature in almost all of the social networking platforms e.g. profiles, options, connections etc.
 - Do more research. You'd be amazed to learn that hundreds of networks almost identical to yours are very well established on existing social networking sites that simply allow users to run their own network and apply any theme or branding to it that makes it more simple than you could imagine to develop a network that you own and be able to reach the target audience with the added reassurance that any technical, legal or political issue affecting your business would be dealt with by the company in question and not any registered user such as yourself. So perhaps you find several networks dedicated to gardening which would be the niche market for gardeners and garden centres to interact. Your social network may be specifically aimed at gardeners in South Africa therefore it would make sense to apply the same model and follow identical rules of the existing networks to your target audience in South Africa. The results are much more easily achieved without much of the planning and developmental work as you would need to do if you hadn't found the closest working example that you could use as your primary reference material for your own network.
 - Don't fall into the trap of ignoring the advice you didn't want to hear - keep your eyes and ears open and never stop doing your research because the more information you gather that relates to your own product makes you become much more equipped in terms of your skills and knowledge to successfully run the network and capture an audience that provides you with sufficient resources that you would need to continue operating the network in relation to the demands that would increase over time.
