I have found a company who supply the parts I need for repairing computers. 

They have excellent customer service both before and after a purchase has been made. Returns are dealt with quickly and professionally. 

They are also very competitive on price. 

The problem is they charge when an order is placed which doesn't help me. 

Would I be better off using a credit card with 30 days credit or are there other solutions available?

If you a $0.00 balance credit card which charges no interest for 30 days, that might be your best solution. Providing you pay it off within the 30 days.
