<p>I have found a company who supply the parts I need for repairing computers. </p>

<p>They have excellent customer service both before and after a purchase has been made. Returns are dealt with quickly and professionally. </p>

<p>They are also very competitive on price. </p>

<p>The problem is they charge when an order is placed which doesn't help me. </p>

<p>Would I be better off using a credit card with 30 days credit or are there other solutions available? </p>

<p>If you a $0.00 balance credit card which charges no interest for 30 days, that might be your best solution. Providing you pay it off within the 30 days.</p>
