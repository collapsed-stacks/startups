I'm going to be starting a new US based company the has an online presence as well as offers nation/world wide consulting services. If I file the LLC in my home state of FL, what is needed to conduct business beyond my home state?

As an example, if I have people in CA buying one of my products online, would I need to obtain "Foreign Qualification" in CA or is such a transaction not considered as "doing business" in CA? In terms of consulting services, if I have a client in CA, where I fly out to work with the client in person, would I need to obtain "Foreign Qualification" in CA?

I'm a bit confused on what is needed to do business beyond my home state. Most online resources/docs sound like they cater to "mom and pop" shops with a store front. My business is the complete opposite. I'm always moving and on the road...the traveling salesman!!

The reason I'm asking this is because I've became aware of the benefits of filing in states like DE,WY,NV. I've read up a bit on the "rules and regulations" but I'm still a bit confused as to whether or not I could take advantage of these options. Again my business transactions are all online and I consult with clients across the nation/world, so I don't really have a "home base". I thought I could just have a registered agent in say WY, then conduct my business where ever, nation or world wide. Since my company is geographically unrestricted, should/can I take advantage of filing in states like DE,WY,NV?

In summary, I don't have a store front and want to do business beyond my home state. What is needed to conduct business beyond my home state and should I take advantage of filing in other states like DE,WY,or NV?

The first part of your question is easy.  If you sell products online to people all over the country and never leave Florida for business, then you are doing business **only** in Florida and you don't have to register in any other states.

If you start traveling to other states as part of your business, then eventually you may cross a line where you are doing business in other states.  I'm pretty sure a few isolated trips a year would be ok, but if you start going to another state every month, then you might be doing business in that state.  I don't know offhand what the threshold is and it is probably state specific, so you should do research for individual states if you are traveling there on a regular basis.

If you create an LLC in DE, WY, or NV, then you would definitely need to register in FL because that is where you are doing most of your work.  For most small LLCs, it is not worth the effort to create an LLC in a state other than your home state.  More paperwork and fees for very little benefit.
