<p>I have been working with a co-founder that I found on AngelList. He has an idea that he feels is very useful.</p>

<p>After a few months, I got his confidence, I asked to see the design of his idea. (I signed a NDA). He sent me a word file that sounds a lot like a typical product description on Amazon for any product. </p>

<p>There are no wireframes nor details of any kind that specifically explain how the product looks, what components it includes and what exactly they do. No diagrams.</p>

<p>His idea sounds interesting to me but I have no way to know if it would be workable and if it would do what one would expect.</p>

<p>Based on my previous questions that were answered on this list, I would think that order should something like this. </p>

<ol>
<li>Find a concept that makes sense why it would make things better for people in a practical way.</li>
<li>Develop a realistic design for a product.</li>
<li>See if there is a demand for it.</li>
<li>Make a pitch and a prototype that works enough to convince series A and VC's to invest.</li>
<li>Get funding to get the product into production.</li>
<li>Manufacture.</li>
<li>Market.</li>
<li>Sell the product.</li>
</ol>

<p>I would love to hear peoples' thoughts on how to asses whether or not to proceed with this startup based on what I've written.</p>

<p>If people think that it's normal to do things this way, I would like to know if it make sense to even to try to raise money without a design. That is why my co-founder would like to do now. He wants me to sign up to accelerators and try to get funding.</p>

<p>Any thoughts?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>You could succeed in getting funding based upon your or your co-founder's track record and pitching a conceptual solution. I personally would want to see at a prototype if I were going to invest. I think that would be a common expectation, but there are always some people who will invest without - you may just get a worse investment deal.</p>

<p>With the kind of product you are talking about why not go to a rapid prototype design shop? Get them to put a model together and then use that. If there are special heating elements to the concept then you could consider patent protection as a way of increasing likelihood of a funding. However, it also depends on whether patent protection or funding access is something that your prospective accelerators would offer. Then it would make sense to try and join quickly.</p>
