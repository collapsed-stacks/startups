<p>I am setting up a startup physically located in China, no shareholders are American.</p>

<p>I need to have my IP in a Delaware-C-Corp, that's a constraint from the investors.</p>

<p>That being said, I don't know the US tax system very well and I am quite afraid of forgetting something here and there, then having to pay penalties.</p>

<p>Someone told me to register an independant Chinese company, do everything there and just give the US company an option to purchase the Chinese company for 1$.<br />
Money transfers from the US company to the Chinese one would be done via invoices.</p>

<p>Is that legal ? <br />
If not, is there another way to have a low paperwork structure ?</p>

<p>Again, I am <strong>not</strong> trying to avoid taxes ! I am trying to avoid paperwork, hassles and penalties.</p>

<p>What you need to do is engage a Registered Agent. This is a company that will do the paperwork in Delaware, and serve as an agent if anyone needs to serve you with legal paperwork, etc. </p>

<p>I don't necessarily recommend this registered agent, but they have a quick rundown of what you need to do: <a href="https://www.delawareregisteredagent.com/how-to/non-us-delaware-llc-corporation" rel="nofollow">https://www.delawareregisteredagent.com/how-to/non-us-delaware-llc-corporation</a></p>
