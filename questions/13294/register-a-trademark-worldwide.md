<p>I have a company name let's say ABC.</p>

<p>I live in Canada and I want to register my company's name worldwide and prevent someone else using ABC as a brand name</p>

<p>How can I do that? Is there a way to do it once? (Canada is not a member of the MAdrid's agreement of the World intellectual Property Organization)</p>

<p>Thank you</p>

<p>There's no real way to register once for all of the world. You'll have to register in each place you want to do business.</p>

<p>Registration is usually multi-tiered and means different things.</p>

<p>For example, in the United States, you'll have to register a legal entity name, which is with a single state of choice. You'll then file with the IRS for a Tax ID Number, which references the state-specific legal registration. Then you'll register a "foreign entity" in every state you'll do business in -- often referred to as a Doing Business As (DBA). You can then register a business trademark, which is for a logo or text (or both combined) - which will be in each <em>category</em> you'll want to do business in. The more the better, but the more expensive.</p>

<p>Trademarks are why things like <em>Flywheel</em> exists. There's a <a href="http://flywheeltaxi.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">taxi app company</a>, a <a href="http://flywheelsports.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer">cycling company</a>, and <a href="http://flywheelcoworking.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">a coworking space</a> all called Flywheel.</p>
