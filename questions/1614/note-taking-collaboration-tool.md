I'm searching for a note taking tool for my Startup, properties as listed below.

- Windows & Mac desktop applications (wont be a browser app)
- Android & Ios apps.
- Decent interface such as Evernote or inote
- Automatic sync.
- 5 people collaboration
- Free

As extra if it supports spreadsheets that would be awesome but not necessary. 
Basically we want Evernote which syncs as good as dropbox.

Note: Evernote either syncs when clicked on sync or at the best, syncs every 5 minutes.

<p><a href="http://slack.com" rel="nofollow">Slack</a> or <a href="http://trello.com" rel="nofollow">Trello</a></p>

<p>Then integrate them with dropbox to have spreadsheets.
Both syncs realtime.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.slant.co/topics/697/~what-are-the-best-cross-platform-note-taking-apps" rel="nofollow">Here</a> you can find the best note taking tools. </p>

<p>Quip, gingko, polynote, simplenote and evernote were the best ones we liked.</p>

<p>Quip is great with spreadsheets and all but not flexible as evernote, we wanted something which is easier to get around your notes.</p>

<p>Gingko is awesome, a brand new style of note taking, though they didnt have mobile yet so we wont be using it. (I surely want to try it out when their mobile comes out)</p>

<p>Polynote is 20$ per year, other than that I think its the best one.</p>

<p>Simplenote seemed too simple, we needed something with a little more functions</p>

<p>We have decided to use evernote, though it'd be better if it had live sync, but still it is the thing closest to solving our problem.</p>
