I am about to start a local job board site. It will be for a niche market. I am not sure how to start it, whether start from getting company to provide job list first, or getting jobseeker to submit resume first. 

For my idea, I think I would go for company first. Will offer them free of charge for couple months. Then..., which marketing strategy would work best to get jobseeker to submit resume? And which strategy to get company to post on my site? (FYI My competitor has 2.5M resumes in the data, focus on all type, not focus on niche)


Or any idea would work better? anyone has an experience running a job board site?

I am planning to use this theme http://www.enginethemes.com/demo/jobengine/ since it looks clean and easy. 
If  you have a recommendation on theme, please feel free to suggest. I am a new coder, want a theme that does not have to modify much.

Best.

I toyed around a lot with this idea in my head because I worked at a company where we had over 2M resumes, just as in your case.

I think you need to go after both from the beginning.

Find 2-3 companies willing to post jobs, and find 3-4 really skilled people in that niche who are willing to sign up.

The smaller the niche the easier to accomplish. 

If you start calling you will find companies willing to post even if you have no resumes. They have monthly budgets they can spend, and hiring targets they need to fulfill. Opening up a niche market to them is a very attractive proposition, because this means less searching, which means less costs.

If you can find 3 or 4 people who are good in the niche you're targeting and convince them to sign up there's no reason why companies wouldn't want to post jobs. This is the harder part, I would find out where these guys hang out and meet them in person to convince them to sign up. Actually I would do this for the first 20 - 50 people. I would hunt them all down and plead my case to them. 

They have to go trough the pain of filling out their resumes which is **THE** biggest issue I see if there are no jobs.

Meeting them in person or if you can't, reaching out to them and talking to them, asking them to help you out (because you will get them their dream jobs), is what you need to do, because at this point they will make or break your business. Imagine that there are only 10 people in the entire country working in that niche. If you can get 3 of them sign up, you already have a successful business. I'm guessing that you have more, but at this point the same principle applies.
