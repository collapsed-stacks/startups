I'm a software developer and i am trying to code projects with my friend at our spare time. When looking for a place to sit down and work, we realized there is no such a good place for this job. And now we are looking for ways to build one. 

I like to mention that we both are still young people and we don't have much funds, almost none. 

We have a concept in mind. We want to build a place that can host meethubs, where people can sit down to work with their laptops and eat, drink while they are doing that. 

Since our funds are almost none, i am looking for ways to get some money to start the bussiness. What i don't know is what banks and investors think about such thing?

Will that be funny if i want to talk with an investor about building a cafe? Where should i look for some funds?

The key thing that separates a Startup from any other lifestyle business is "Growth".
If you are planning to open only one Cafe and then it is not that interesting to investors, and you will have better luck looking for a bank loan. However, if you have figured out how to scale the model and replicate it across different cities, or you have found a new kind f market for such Cafes, then you have potential to grow rapidly. In that your idea will be interesting for VCs. From the description given in the question it is not clear what you have in mind.

Well starting your own cafe is also counted as a startup as you are putting in something and in order for it to be successful, you need a twisting with a tail mind, what I want to say is, startups are like that, filling up the hollow pots and giving audience a new taste.
