## What are the pitfalls of a hardware subscription-based model?

We're building an open source plant lab, and some the embedded sensors need to be (re-)calibrated after some time (6 months to one year). Also, we need everything to work, so if something breaks, we'd like to offer full support in order to get the lab working properly again asap. It's part of a citizen science and open science project with the European Space Agency.

Although it seems easier just to sell kits, I do seem to lean toward a model where support and uptime and reliability can be guaranteed (which is not just software issue, but very much a hardware issue).
