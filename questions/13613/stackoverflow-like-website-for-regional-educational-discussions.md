<p>Inspired from Stackoverflow, I have an idea of a online forum for students in Pakistan where they can help each other with questions related to academia specific to Pakistan which can help them get better grades and grasp concepts. My question is how can a free site like this make a profit(and how many users are required to make visit it in order to make a meaningful profit)?</p>

<p>How monetize your application ist completely up to you.</p>

<p>Your main audience are children. So things like (unfiltered) ads are no option. It could hurt your image. Still children are a strong "buyer group".</p>

<p>Possible are many things, like white label it for schools, events, contests.</p>

<p>Also you could be able to introduce influencer marketing (create a blog and sell some space to contents, which fit your audience)</p>

<p>How about creating a "job pool" for private tutoring?</p>

<p>Then a free/premium model could be an alternative: free - ask/answer questions; premium - also watch/do courses which help you on certain topics. A free user could be able to earn premium rights etc.</p>

<p>Maybe there is a way to receive funds/support from State/help organizations.</p>

<p>So there are many things you can do, but be aware: you have to commit to your model, once you have selected one.</p>
