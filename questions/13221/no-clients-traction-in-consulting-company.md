I have set up my IT consulting group 2 months in London and I have been using cold calling and emails to targeted groups in order to try and acquire potential clients. I have hired a marketing person to take care of these activities, whilst I am trying to participate to various events around my subject. The above have given me little to no traction on potential clients. 
Any ideas how to proceed?
