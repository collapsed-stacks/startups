Let me clarify something:

`Ideas, are generally worthless.. without execution.`

Crowdfunding websites are similar. You usually can't approach to crowdfunding unless you have at least a basic prototype.

There are many crowd funding platforms in India and to explore that all you need to do is google.

    ketto.org 
    bitgiving.com 
    start51.com 

In India these things are in initial stage and getting an idea funded is going to be difficult because that wont attract potential supporters. To be honest a few things even seem dubious in this whole scene to me, I was just checking start51 and there they have funded a website that is for career and in return people only get advertising and brand promotion, no equity. 

Get some traction on your side or else if you have some ground breaking idea then obviously that'll help.
