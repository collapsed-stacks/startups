<p>We are going to participate in a startup contest with a product we are building, a versatile educational platform that can be applied in a lot of different areas. Particularly we are now creating three products based on this platform: a math course, a languages course and a humanities course. They all are so different that they don't seem to be running on the same platform.</p>

<p>In this contest, they request us a detailed description of the project but with a very limited text length. We are not able to describe the platform and all the courses we are building in depth. So we have the following options:</p>

<p><strong>1.-</strong> Describe the platform and not the courses, so we wouldn't show the products that we are really launching</p>

<p><strong>2.-</strong> Describe superficially only the three launching courses, so we wouldn't show the platform and its versatility</p>

<p><strong>3.-</strong> Describe the platform and the courses but very superficially, so we would show almost nothing</p>

<p>Note that in all cases we have also to show a market study, propects, business model, etc.</p>

<p>How would you pitch a product like this, that can have very different types of applications and customers, in a startup contest or to VC?</p>

<p>What would it be better: focus or scalability/versatility?</p>

<p>For a startup <strong>Focus</strong> is key. Get it working for one specific niche example, get some kind of cash flow and then branch out.</p>

<p>Instead of 3 courses, try to understand which course would create the most value for your customers with the least work from your perspective and do that one first in depth.</p>

<p>For example - maybe 'math' might be the focus:
 easier to recruit math users than humanities? 
 easy to automate marking and give quick feedback...</p>

<p>The platform is a means to enable cheap scaling, from a customer perspective I don't really care too much about the platform as long as things work for me. It might be a mistake to over-invest in the platform before you've validated your product-market fit for at least a couple of different courses.</p>
