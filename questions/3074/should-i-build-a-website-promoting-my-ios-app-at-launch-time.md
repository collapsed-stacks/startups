<p>I'm about to launch my ios app in very few days. </p>

<p>I haven't a website yet composed of a landingpage promoting the mobile application.</p>

<p>As my goal is to find my earliest adopters, what is the point of building a landingpage available at www.myappname.com?</p>

<p>Is it really worth? Or is the apple store (search engine + good app description + screenshots) just enough in that context of "learning" ( lean startup step) ?</p>

<p>The App store's "landing page" isn't good enough, because your clients will tend to google your app or your company.</p>

<p>By creating some kind of website, you (should) establish that:</p>

<ol>
<li>You are an actual business (or an indie dev, which is fine too)</li>
<li>You can be contacted for more information, feedback, or support</li>
</ol>

<p>The site itself needs not be complex. Even if it consists in a single landing page, you'll be able to lay it out in a way that conveys more information and trust than the App Store does. Use its url instead of its iTunes url when discussing it in forums and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Also, it gives you the opportunity to set up a subscription form that invites users to sign up for more information, which you'll want to drip using an auto-responder (e.g. "Get 10 free tips on how to use our XYZ app for ..."). This will allow you to educate prospective users (higher conversion rate) or educate existing ones (higher engagement and retention rates).</p>

<p>Having a nice, clean, professional website (even a one-pager!) will go a long way. If you're stronger in app development and not so strong in web development, use a Wix, Buildicus or Weebly to drag and drop a quick landing page.</p>

<p>You should begin establishing your presence for when people begin searching for you outside of the app store.</p>
