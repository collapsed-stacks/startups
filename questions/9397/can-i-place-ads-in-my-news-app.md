<p>I'm currently getting into the basics of iOS development. <br >
I've designed a simple RSS feed where users can just add their favorite news outlets into one feed.</p>

<p>Can I place ads in this app? </p>

Yes you can place an ad inside your RSS feed app.</p>

<p><strong>BUT</strong></p>

<p>Apple won't validate your application if the only thing it does it displaying a RSS feed.<br />
It's against Apple Review Appstore policies.</p>
