<p>I have a startup and my team and I have already gotten pretty far in the development process. I am now wondering about what I should call our app. It is a social based app and we are looking for a name that's easy to use. We also want it to be able to transform and fit easily as a new pop culture word (e.g. Twitter have tweets, YouTube have YouTuber, etc.)</p>

<p>What are good practices when it comes to choosing a name for our company/app?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>I'm not just looking to name my company but I also want to make it so that it could be used as a new term to describe the type of user who use my app. Naming an app is not hard but naming it so it can be transform into a term that people will use to describe others it's a whole new game.</p>

<p>The question of the name is likely answered by looking at the target market for your app and what message you'd like to name to project to potential users.  A catchy name is all fine and well, but it shouldn't be the deciding factor in your ultimate choice.  Remember that ALL of your marketing is going to include the use of your name in some form or fashion, so the name you choose will have a substantial impact on how you market it going forward.
So ask yourself, what do you think would flow in being memorable to prospective customers and at the same time help you create an overall brand identity that will be your image to the world.  These are questions that you should be able to answer if you've done your homework.  <strong>Writing</strong> an app is only the first small part of the puzzle : you need to know who you want to reach, what appeals to them, and what would give your brand "stickiness" (something easy to remember) in your audience's mind.  If they don't buy (or start using your app) right away, being a name they can identify with and perhaps has some nexus to the market it serves can make all the difference in whether they come back later and become customers.  This is just some food for thought.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
