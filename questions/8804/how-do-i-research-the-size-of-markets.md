<p>Ideally it would be good to drill down to specific types of market and market specialisms. </p>

<p>E.g. something like contribution to revenue of tourism vs consumer technology retail and also specific areas like inbound / outbound tourism, and niches like group tours, independent travel, etc and equivalent in other industries.</p>

<p>Possible duplicate of something I answered earlier <a href="https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/8810/where-can-i-find-case-studies-of-e-business-startups/8816#8816">Where can I find case studies of e business startups?</a></p>

<p><em>Update2017</em>: <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://ec.europa.eu/</a> refers to EuroStat which compiles statistics from various EU28 Government departments. It can be a goldmine for any market research. It sometimes includes info for EU28+3 (Turkey being one of the extra three). Most information is translated into multiple languages too.</p>

<p>I would suggest you also look out for an economics library - I'm lucky to have two of the biggest in Germany within a couple of hours drive of me. If you cannot find an economics library, then try an ordinary library and ask them if they get any international newspapers, magazines (like the economist or bloomberg magazine). Failing that, find a college/university that does economics and ask them to direct you towards material.</p>

<p>Best of luck</p>
