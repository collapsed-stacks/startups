Can you suggest sites/forums where one can watch for new tech trends and discuss new tech trends? Blogs and magazines don't seem like the best place for this as discussion is not their main focus and the news they post isn't that cutting-edge - by the time it gets published it's already gained some traction.

For example AnandTech/Hacker News/Dzone/Techcrunch/Slashdot. 

Also, if you like to watch YouTube videos check out DrunkTechReview channel.
