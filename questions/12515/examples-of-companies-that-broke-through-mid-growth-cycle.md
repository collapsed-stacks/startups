I have a relationship with a web design company that has had explosive revenue growth over the past ~20 years. The company is well-established and medium sized (recent top-line revenue figures are measured in the tens of millions). The company focuses on a niche market for web design, and the company has harvested most of the low-hanging fruit... revenue growth is slowing (but still positive) and the sales team is having trouble making sales targets. The glory days of rapid growth have came to an end. 

Management is concerned about the future of the company. The situation is viewed as a defining moment for the company: will the company be able to push through continue to grow, or will it stagnate? 

My question: are there historical analogues to this sort of situation? What companies/management teams were faced with stalling revenues and innovated their way out of it?
