<p>At my company we use the term "new logos" in context of acquiring new customers, but I never heard it before so I googled and I could barely find anything except for this one article: <a href="http://www.salesbenchmarkindex.com/blog/the-reason-you%E2%80%99re-not-winning-more-new-logos" rel="nofollow">The Reason Youâ€™re Not Winning More New Logos</a></p>

<p>I think this use of "logo" may be coming from a common practice of showing your customers' logos on your web site as a kind of reference, as can be seen in these examples. </p>
