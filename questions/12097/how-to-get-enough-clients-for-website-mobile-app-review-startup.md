I have an idea of a startup that tests websites and mobile apps for clients and gives them reviews on their product. Our clients are entrepreneurs who launch their sites and apps. How do I find clients for my startup?

1. Join different start up groups in facebook and give them a free shot
2. Put a nice call to action
3. Open a quora profile. Answer questions on speed and website test. End an answer with your link and purpose
4. Promote your product on linked in (not facebook or instagram)
5. If you have money ask bloggers to write about you
6. If you have an app, use ASO

A simple answer to your question, ask the startups.

There are 1000s of startup outside, who doesn't want to spend money on QA Engineers and expensive testing tools. You might want to ask them. It is very tedious but I have realise one thing, startups are faster in responses than stablished companies. 

Just try to look around the environment, and you will get your clients.

I have helped many startups get clients, just by "mouth of word".

Agreed with @Raj that you can promote using Social-Marketing strategies but if you don't have much connections, it will be hard with Social-Marketing.

One of the best way's is to be an authority in that particular community. If you truly believe in your idea, go to where the tech guys are.

Conventions in my line of startup were the greatest way to meet people, make partnerships and give an illusion we are bigger than we are. 

Our product was good, our idea was good, but what made the most difference was making a name for ourselves by literally walking boot to booth, room to room and making deals, trading services, and becoming friends.

As was always told to me and true still, someone needs 3-5 interactions with you to remember you. After that, regular email or phone calls throughout the year to stay in touch. Building this network is key to any success and it starts with the places your customers gather. for you it seems like its a B2B business model which is good because there's definitely conventions where "B's" meet up and have booths :)

Here's a list of a few that google found for me (I searched "app convention Bay Area")
