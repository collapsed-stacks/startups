<p>I have been trying to find funding for my company for quite some time. I mainly approached other tech companies and competition sponsors to see if they would be willing to invest but none of them have responded to me.<br>I am thinking of approaching an asset management firm that is quite popular and big locally. Would asset managers invest in my startup or do some out there in the world invest in startups too?</p>

<p>As a firm, it depends. A VC is an asset manager, as is someone who runs a hedge fund or a trading desk. Some invest in startups at various stages. Some VCs invest in MBOs and LBOs, it really all depends on what they told their clients when they rose their funds and the client agreement that ensued. A fund in charge of buying securities on the stock market will likely stick to doing that.</p>

<p>As individuals, they might if they're interested... Provided, of course, that they're allowed to based on their partner agreement.</p>
