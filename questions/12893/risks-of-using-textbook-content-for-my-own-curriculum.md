I'm creating an online language learning app which will eventually be for profit. Being online, it will have global reach.

I am following along with curricula from textbooks for:

- Words/phrases to teach
- Grammar patterns
- Cadence / chronology of when one should learn each

The reasons for using textbooks are:

- I want to prepare students for college exams
- I want to be sure I'm covering words necessary for effective conversation

But I am **creating my own exercises and modules** to teach the content of these books. 

If I'm delivering this content in my own unique ways, and simply borrowing the content from these books to fill my own modules, am I at risk of being sued?

The only protection they have is the so called copyright which is the right to use this exact piece of art, formulation, phraseing or drawing. So as long as you **DO NOT COPY PASTE** any material be it text, drawings, pictures, graphs ect. you will be fine. 

The content of a text book as long as it is common knowlege you are not obligated to citate. In general it is a good idea to citate your source material, so your costumers can follow your research. If you orientate you on a existing textbook, while creating your own visualizations and excersises you will not only be safe from a legal perspective but, in my opinion, also from a business perspective. There is a need for more playful learning-tools!

Good luck!
