<p>What happens to the unvested stock, if a startup is acquired before the equity of founders and first time employees vests completely?</p>

<h3>Example Scenario</h3>

<p>Let's say a founder or an early stage employee <code>X</code>  started working with a company with <code>E</code> equity to be vested over a 4 years period (<code>E/4</code> vested annually). After 2 years the company is undergoing an acquisition. Half the stock of <code>X</code> i.e. <code>E/2</code> is still unvested. Is X expected to leave with <code>E/2</code> only or can the <code>initial vesting terms</code> or <code>acquisition terms</code> override this in a manner that allows the founder to leave with <code>&gt;E/2</code> stock on an acqusition?</p>

<p>Personally, as someone who is starting (or at least trying to) a startup, I worked that into the contract for founders (I actually did that yesterday. The contract is for founders only because I am still looking for a partner). The founder will receive the totality of what is agreed upon after five years (provided he fulfill all the requirements, of course), through monthly "installments"(he gets a piece each month), or at the exit (sale, bankruptcy, etc).</p>
