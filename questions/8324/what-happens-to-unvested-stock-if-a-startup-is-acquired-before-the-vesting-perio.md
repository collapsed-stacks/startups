What happens to the unvested stock, if a startup is acquired before the equity of founders and first time employees vests completely?

### Example Scenario
Let's say a founder or an early stage employee `X`  started working with a company with `E` equity to be vested over a 4 years period (`E/4` vested annually). After 2 years the company is undergoing an acquisition. Half the stock of `X` i.e. `E/2` is still unvested. Is X expected to leave with `E/2` only or can the `initial vesting terms` or `acquisition terms` override this in a manner that allows the founder to leave with `>E/2` stock on an acqusition?

Personally, as someone who is starting (or at least trying to) a startup, I worked that into the contract for founders (I actually did that yesterday. The contract is for founders only because I am still looking for a partner). The founder will receive the totality of what is agreed upon after five years (provided he fulfill all the requirements, of course), through monthly "installments"(he gets a piece each month), or at the exit (sale, bankruptcy, etc).
