<p>Simple scenario (I hope). 1 founder and 1 investor. 100 Shares in total for easy math.</p>

<p>Investor wants 70% of preferred shares. Am I correct in assuming that the founder would then have 100% voting shares and 30% dividend shares (common stock)?</p>

<p>So perhaps 3 different share classes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Preferred</li>
<li>Class A (Voting)</li>
<li>Class B (Dividend)</li>
</ul>

<p>In order for the investor to have the 70% they want, does that basically mean that the shares among others need to balance?</p>

<p>This would generally mean that the investor would own 70% of the company, but their shares would be preferred shares (with whichever types of preferences that have been negotiated)</p>

<p>So, you would start the business with 100 shares of common stock that you own.</p>

<p>The investor would give you money and you would create 233 new shares with preference.</p>

<p>They would have 233 preferred shares out of 333 total shares giving them 70% of the business.</p>

<p>You would have your original 100 shares of common stock out of 333 total shares giving you 30% of the business.</p>

<p>You'd have two classes of shares.
233 preferred
100 common.</p>
