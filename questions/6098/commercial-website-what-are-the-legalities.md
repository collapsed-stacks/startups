I know this is a big question, so I understand I probably won't get a nice and simple list of dos and don'ts, but I'm willing to work to move this forward, and I have to start somewhere.

I've been building a website for the past few months that is basically a media sharing website, but it's tailored for a particular audience.  (As per most of these types of question, I'll be leaving the specifics out).

I'm looking at charging a very small amount (around £2 or $3 per month) for each member, primarily to cover the cost of the web server, and then hopefully further down the line it will cover my salary so I can take the project on full time and start to really make it grow.

The site is currently up and running, albeit still in the development phase, and I am about to release it to a group of beta testers in order to iron out any kinks, and identify any areas that need improving.

My real question is about the legalities of the whole thing.  I expect that an online subscription service has to be done "by the book", and I'm afraid I simply don't know where to start.

Any advice relating to this area will be very gratefully received, but any other pointers for a new starter would also be very helpful.

**Edit:** I should point out that I understand there are issues regarding taking payments and PCI compliance, but I'll be taking recurring payments from PayPal, to start with at least.

<p>You don't really ask a question here, but I think I get the point.</p>

<p><strong>This is no legal advice, these are just some considerations, we had to do. It is not a and does replace a legal counsel. If you want to be on the safe side, go see your lawyer of choice.</strong></p>

<p>In Germany, (and as we both are in the EU there should be some similarities) you would have to do the following: </p>

<ul>
<li>Set up Legal Notice (=> <a href="http://www.jnj.com/others/legal-notice" rel="nofollow">About the website</a>)</li>
<li>Get Terms and Conditions (=> <a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/localized-terms" rel="nofollow">About your service</a>)</li>
<li>Write a Privacy Statement (=> <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement/" rel="nofollow">Which data and what you going to do with it</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note, that the complexity differs and is depended on your service. The payment should be part of your Terms and Conditions.</p>

<p>You may let yourself be inspired by some other platforms with subscriptions. Please note, that even terms and conditions are intellectual property, so stealing could backfire to you.</p>

<p>Terms and Conditions normally consist of legal scope, conclusion of contract, rights and obligations of each contractor etc.</p>

<p>Subscriptions come with questions, like "How much?" (in €, $?), "how often?" (per month?), "how long?" (3-month subscription), "automatically renewed?" and "methods and terms for termination?".</p>

<p>If you google for "Terms an conditions templates" or similar you may find something interesting for you.</p>

<p>Also you don't have to provide all different payment solutions by yourself, you may search for a "Payment service provider", which does everything for you, but will ask for a percentage of your transactions. Have you ever asked your private bank consultant? May they have a solution for you or at least some information. It costs nothing to ask.</p>

<p>Hope that helped.</p>
