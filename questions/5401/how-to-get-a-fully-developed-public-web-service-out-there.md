<p>Last year I had one of those "If only there was an easier way to do XXXX..." moments - In this case I was looking to see if there were any car or bike shows on in my local area that weekend.</p>

<p>Following on from that I designed and built a website that made doing that easier, it works, and there is no competition (its sort of an advanced directory website but there is so much more to it than that, and is extremely "monetisable" once i have a good user base)</p>

<p>But now I need to market it, and I'm struggling.
I did a "Soft launch" last year, got some great feedback from the public, businesses and the media, got about 50 show organisers on board (free) - but it stagnated after their shows had run.</p>

<p>I'm really finding it hard to keep momentum and build a user base without a marketing budget, so how it is that some websites manage to grow exponentially (even niche ones like mine) and others fade away? </p>

<p>Since its a website, a good way to invest a bit in Adwords, and other online ad networks. 
Other things that you can do is :</p>

<ul>
<li>Get in touch with bike/car dealerships, sparepart outlets, mechanics, put their ads on your website in return for having a visibility on their website/ store etc. </li>
<li>You should have a social media presence, facebook, twitter etc.</li>
<li>You need to get some SEO work done on your website.</li>
</ul>

<p>Basically you do need to put in some money into the website to ensure that it is out there. Doesn't have to be a huge budget, but it would be hard to get it off without some kind of seed money.  </p>

<p>Here's a thought: perhaps you've no competition because there's no audience -- or not enough of an audience to keep the business running.</p>

<p>Who is your audience? No amount of SEO, media buying, social networking, or what have you will help until you're aware of <em>who</em> is willing to use what you have to offer -- you'll just go sideways. So start by searching for user who:</p>

<ol>
<li>Has the problem you're solving.</li>
<li>Is aware they have the problem.</li>
<li>Is willing to pay to solve it.</li>
</ol>

<p>The rest will follow if you find these users:</p>

<ul>
<li>sales copy: state what the problem is, stir it a bit, state how you solve it, make an offer</li>
<li>content strategy: stir the problem more, establish your expertise (stay informative)</li>
<li>media buying: use it where the audience hangs out</li>
<li>social media: focus on where the audience connects with you</li>
<li>yada yada</li>
</ul>

<p>Pivot if you don't find any.</p>
