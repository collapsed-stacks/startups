What is a good subject title for emails to former customers?

I've been sending emails to customers from 6 months ago up to X years back, sending them short friendly text with new coupons attached.

I've been trying to brainstorm on new possible subject titles that don't sound tacky or like spam mail but I find it easier said than done.

Examples of my current subject lines:

1. Hey Dave, I know it's been a while
2. Hey Sara, Just checking in
3. Hey Marta, How did it go? 

I get the feeling the subject lines I have been using are old and overused by bigger companies for their spam emails, and I don't want my customers just overlooking my emails by title alone.

Can anybody suggest any good subject titles that accomplish: 

1. Telling the customer they used us before 
2. Telling them we have new discounts I want to offer

PS: The business I work for is a detailing company that is ten years old.

Tbh, I've plenty of spam mail that starts like the three subject lines you gave as examples.

Try something like this instead:

> You liked [company or product] X [months|years] ago. We're currently offering a X% discount.

Or variations of that. The point is to let them know -- at least -- what your company or product is from the subject line, and ideally what it's about, and ideally give them a reason to even open the email.

Also, avoid ending up in this situation in the future. To keep your clients coming back and thinking about your business, you need to touch base with them a few times per year. (And in point of fact, the marketing team *should* be in touch with a few clients *every* ... *single* ... *week* by phone or chat.)

Depending on the type of business you're in, you could always create some free content and use that as a means to bring them back to your product or service.

For example; Let's say you sell pet food.

You could create a blog post with the title "5 Tips For Keeping Your Pet Healthy".

In your blog post, one of the tips could be to make sure your pet eats healthy and link to the pet food you sell.

From a consumers point of view, they will appreciate the helpful content and to them it won't look spammy.

So to answer your question. The title of your email would be "5 Tips For Keeping Your Pet Healthy".

This type of scenario can be used for just about any product or service.

**(When I initially read the question I overlooked that you were in the detailing business)**

For your business I would ask YOURSELF these questions.

 - What is the main reason people SHOULD have their car detailed? (Keeps paint shiny? Makes paint last longer? Keeps vehicle from rusting?)

I would then create a blog post with a title something similar to this.. "Don't Let The Paint Fade On Your Vehicle".

Now talk about how having their vehicle detailed (once a month?) can keep their paint looking shiny like the day they got it! Talk about the pro's of getting their vehicle detailed and the cons of not getting it detailed. (I'm assuming you know the answers to these questions)
