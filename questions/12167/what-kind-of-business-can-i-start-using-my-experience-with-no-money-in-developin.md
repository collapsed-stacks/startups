It looks like your best bet would be outsourced or third party QA  for software development. You have tagged "mobile-apps" so I assume that is your area of expertise. 

There are lots of people/SMEs who want to build their own app, but don't have the funds to go to a software house. I would consider how you can add value and differentiate from others on the QA side and then speak to people you know who could benefit from having an app. 

The way that you could add extra value would be project managing the development and ensuring the quality. Think of a Project Manager on a building site- they don't do any manual work, but are responsible to ensuring quality buildings. You may need to work with freelance software developers for this. Good luck.
