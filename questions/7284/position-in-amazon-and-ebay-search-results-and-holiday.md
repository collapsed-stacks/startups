<p>I run a mom and pop ecommerce business - we design, manufacture and sell our own products. There is no one else working except ourselves and soon we will be going for three-weeks long holiday.</p>

<p>Both Amazon and Ebay allow setting the shop in holiday mode and representatives from both these marketplaces admitted that using holiday mode can potentially affect the position of the listings in the ranking.</p>

<p>Given that many our products come on top of the search results, which is primary factor in decision making at the purchase time, I wonder what the best strategy for going on holiday would be.</p>

<p>Have noticed that at least few other sellers instead of putting the shop in holiday mode, recommed either setting all stock levels to zero or tripling the prices.</p>

<p>Both of these practices sound kind of bizzare but I am mostly concerned in coming back on top of the search results.</p>

<p>Does anybody have any successful comebacks to the top of search results after extended holiday period where holiday mode was used?</p>
