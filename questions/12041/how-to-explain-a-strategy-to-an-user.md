I have an app, where users can sell products and earn money with every product they sell. 20'000 downloads but NONE of my users has sold a single product! Every day, I'm getting at least 2 emails, in which users ask "how does this work", "help me" or "i need assistance".
 Also, there are many apps like mine out there, if they don't get the technique fast, they will install another app. So I think the 'tutorial' should be **easy, fast, and interesting** 

What I did until now:

First, I had a text explanation, but I saw, no one will take the time to read it.

So I made a video (users can watch it in my app), 9 minutes long, took me a long time to produce it, and no success, they don't watch the whole video.

I thought about 2 other methods: 

 - Splitting the 9 min video up in tiny 1 or 2 min videos
 - Make an email list, and users who are interested get the information not in a single e-mail but in a series of emails, like the video up-splitting thing.

So basically I want to ask you which method I should try, or if there is a better one, because I don't want to put another few hours of work into something that is not being recognized.

I just had a look on your app. It is also unclear to me how the system would work. I can see "collect gold and diamonds" and then "sell them", but I have absolutely no idea who would buy my golds, and how long would that take me.

 - You only have a few seconds to convince a new user such as myself to try your system. If I can't understand, you lose me.
 - Your app description is way too brief for a complicated game like yours. You have a link, but it's not a clickable link. I had to manually copy-and-paste it into my browser. 99% of the users (in particular those on a mobile device) won't bother.
 - You don't seem to have a proper help page in the app

I spent about a minute on your app page and website, and I still had no idea what it is supposed to do. It was a minute only because I was trying to answer your question. Normally, I would have switched to something else after like 10 seconds.

 - Please consider to document your app better. Your website looks horrible to me.
 - You have to write better description on how the system should work
 - Simplify the game, make it for "dumb" users

Even if could do all that, don't expect too much money from your app. The app quality is questionable. The number of downloads you have is not much for a general Android app. You'll need to have orders of magnitude more number of downloads to drive your system.

I'm dealing with similar problems about how to introduce the public to a new combinatorial game.  The mechanic has extraordinary potential, but the trick will be getting a user base with increasingly short attention spans to try the game *(we know it will do well with hardcore players, but serious monetization will require mass adoption by casual players.)*

The hard answer I'm going to give you without having evaluated your app is that you may need to entirely rethink your interface and website.  It needs to be intuitive, so that people can figure it out without having to read or watch a video.  

*(An analogy is how young children figure out how to use computers and mobile devices--by pressing buttons until the learn how to make it do the things they want.)*

On our project, where the product is actually quite simple, we've redesigned the GUI several times as we zone in on what is going to most facilitate the user and reduce perceived complexity.

One tool you might use could be simple pop-ups, where the first time they press a button, they get a *very brief* explanation of the function.  *(You'll probably need a way for them to access this info after the first time as well, but that's a secondary concern, and can be handled in a number of ways.)*

"Show don't tell" is an axiom in screenwriting because film and television are visual mediums.  Mobile, and computers in general since the early GUIs, are a visual medium as well.  

*(Don't take that last point as a validation of the video tutorial method.  Rather, **find a way to make your functionality as intuitive as possible**, and use icons that are descriptive of their functions.)*
