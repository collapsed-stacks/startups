<p>Imagine to have an idea but you do not have the know-how to compose all details (I mean electrical and mechanical knowledge), how can you get in touch with the industries that might be interested in producing the item you have in mind?</p>

<p>In this case it is an "option" to be added to an object already sold on the market</p>

<p>There's a famous startup mantra: "Ideas are worth nothing, it's execution that matters."</p>

<p>1) You cannot attract the attention of the industry players, without actually building at least a prototype. Then you need empirical evidence that customers really need this product and are willing to pay for it, is the best proof of concept. Try to validate your idea at minimum cost.</p>

<p>2) The best way to choose what startup idea to work on is to look into your own expertise. You need to have at least 1 of the core competencies that this idea requires to be successfully realised. Usually, there are 3 main roles (people) that every founding team needs: someone to build the product, someone to sell the product and someone to take care for the money. Say,it's a food delivery app - you need a mobile developer to build the app, you need a sales person to close partnerships with restaurants and delivery companies (who ideally has previous experience in the industry so has good network and many insights) and you need a financial guy to manage the cash flow, do some budgeting, fundraising, legal stuff (could also be responsible for operations, payroll, etc). Another common concept is the HHH founding team: Every startup founding team needs a Hacker (developer) to build the product, a Hipster (designer) to make it pretty and easy to use and a Hustler (business person) to sell it.</p>

<p>3) So if you possess at least one of the above mentioned expertise, then best is to go out there and find a co-founder with complimentary skills. Best co-founders are friends, family, co-workers - people you've been through ups and downs with, because building a startup is an extremely difficult journey and strangers may easily split up. You can meet potential co-founders through your network, meetups, startup events, etc. Just go out there and pitch your idea, be passionate about it.</p>

<p>The idea is nothing itself. You need to show how your idea makes more money. It consists of making a prototype, ...</p>

<p>So you need to find someone interested to your idea and make partnership or hire someone to do your idea. Then you're able to negotiate or even propose your idea.</p>

<p>The result is the idea is not worth by itself. </p>
