<p>If I incorporate in Hong kong in the name of my current canadian incorporation, will I have to declare and be taxed on all the profits that my hong kong corporation will generate?
Even since the Hong kong corporation will be an LLC that is considered a Separate Legal Entity ?</p>

<p>To give me money I would send dividends from the HK LLC to the canadian corporation, the canadian corporation would then send me the dividends and I would be paying taxes only on my dividends.</p>

<p>Or since I live in Canada my worldwide income must be declared and pay taxes on ALL the profits EVEN the HK LLC's ?</p>
