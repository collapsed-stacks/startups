I am working on a tutor finding website. I have designed a website where parents/students will be able to search tutors in their locality. They would be able to see their phone numbers and contact them. I am thinking what could be the potential business model in it.

If I charge people to see contact details of the teacher, no one would pay. Nor would anybody pay for using the website.

I am thinking the following business model: I keep the whole process free and make money by ads and paid results ( asking for a fee from the tutor to get them listed on the top on search results).
