<p>I'm looking for an alternative to <a href="https://stripe.com/connect" rel="nofollow">Stripe Connect</a>, where I can allow clients of my business to accept payments from their customers. I know of Braintree, but from what I've seen they don't offer the ability to let customers who use my service to accept payments straight to their bank accounts.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
