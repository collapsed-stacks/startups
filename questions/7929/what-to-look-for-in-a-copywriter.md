<p>I am looking for your advise regarding copy-writing as I do not have any relevant experience in this domain.   </p>

<p>I am building a new startup where startups connect with early adopters segmented based on products they used before.</p>

<p>I am publishing stories of startups which validated their products before. My goal of this blog is to make visitors subscribe to our mailing list, so I want to hire a freelance copywriter but I do not know what are the qualification to look for. Please share your experience in the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>How to tell a good from a bad copywriter (I do not even know what good/bad means)?</li>
<li>What are the metrics to measure quality?</li>
<li>Is there a standard process that copywriters usually follow?</li>
<li>What are the technical skills, I must look for?  </li>
</ol>

<p>My good friend <a href="https://twitter.com/bradshorr" rel="nofollow">@bradshorr</a> suggested <a href="http://www.jeffbullas.com/2013/12/20/50-attributes-of-a-great-copywriter/" rel="nofollow">50 Attributes of a Great Copywriter</a></p>

<p>Since that is a long list, I will highlight a few:</p>

<ul>
<li>Quality: spelling, grammer, conciseness, vocabulary, clarity, compelling</li>
<li>Knowledge: knows the industry or has a keen interest in learning it</li>
<li>Passion: Cares about your business and what it has to offer</li>
<li>Business: Understands marketing, SEO, business processes</li>
<li>Story-teller, listens, takes notes, logical, imaginative</li>
</ul>

<p>And as a bonus: A good copywriter will be able to show samples of their work. If they make you want to buy what they are writing about, they are good.</p>

<p>Simple test: Google them and start reading what they write. If they bore you out, they'll probably bore your readers out too.</p>

<p>More practically:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Good writers get to the point. They often copy-edit what they write to strip out words - and sentences - that add no value.</p></li>
<li><p>Good copywriters talk to their readers with an active voice, use action verbs, and strive to keep things concrete: "Contact us and our sales team will get back to you".</p></li>
<li><p>Great copywriters are storytellers. A good story has a hero your readers can identify with, a complication, and a resolution.</p></li>
<li><p>Good sales copywriters understand the importance of headlines. Quoting John Caples (it's called the "Caples Award" for a reason):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>... I spend hours on headlines - days if necessary. And when I get a good headline, I know that my task is nearly finished. Writing copy can usually be done in a short time, if necessary. And that advertisement will be a good one - that is, if the headline is a stopper.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>

<p>In terms of process, the key is research. You need to do some - a lot, in fact - to find a good angle. Beyond that it depends on the writer. Some massage each sentence as they go. Others brain dump their thoughts and trim. I'm more of the latter.</p>

<p>Being technical can actually get in your way: you end up needing a lot of empathy to get your point across in pain English. By contrast, a non-techie will <em>make you</em> say it in plain English until <em>they</em> grok it well enough to spew it back at you. It's a bit approximate at times but the net result is worth it.</p>
