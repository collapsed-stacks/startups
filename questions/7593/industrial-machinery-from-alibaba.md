<p>Does anyone have any experience in buying industrial machinery from Alibaba? I'm working in a investment plan for my company (food sector), and I need to buy an autoclave for sterilization. Prices in Alibaba can be up to 10 times lower that the quotation I get from suppliers in Europe. Nevertheless I really don't know if the machinery is trustable. What do you think?</p>

<p>If the machinery costs a substantial amount, I would consider going to China and meeting with a couple of vendors and checking out their product for yourself. I would also recommend checking out a trade show/expo in China.</p>
