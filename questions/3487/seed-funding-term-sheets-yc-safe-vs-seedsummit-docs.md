I am raising seed from an Advisors.

He is more a "Friend and Family" than an "unknown greedy VC of doom"

I am wondering what are the key differences between the [YC Safe term sheet][1]
and the [Series Seed - Stock Investment Agreement][2]

In my particular case, we have already agreed on a number of shares, and I don't need to give too many special rights. I am really looking for a founder friendly term sheet.

I live in (and love) Hong Kong, but we'll incorporate in Delaware

I think a real point to point comparison might be useful to more people than specific advices in my case.

In your answer please state if you are an entrepreneur or VC

From my own research, here is what I found :


 - The Safe is much easier to understand. Three options : Cap no Discount (Give a percentage for a given price), No Cap but discount (Ensure he will have a X time return on investment), Cap or Discount (Ensure he will have the best between X% shares or a Y time return on investment.
 - The Seedsummit document pre-negociates some term for the preferred stock. Like the number of board members. The safe will just assume that those terms will be negotiated later during the A round.
 - Seedsummit seems much more investor friendly, as stated in their [own blog][3] : 

> To clarify, there is no question that as an entrepreneur you would prefer uncapped convertible debt to equity.  As Josh and many others point out, this is typically not a fair deal for the investors and many investors wonâ€™t do it, or will only do it for people that they are blindly in love with.

A good alternative for a seed round is to use convertible debt instead, it will allow to defer the decision on valuation to the series A. With the convertible note it is also typical to have a discount of 10-30% for the initial seed investors.
