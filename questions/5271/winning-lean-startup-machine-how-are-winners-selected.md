Even though the Lean Startup Machine events are focused on startup teams rapidly engaging markets to produce measurable results, comparing the results between the teams seems like it might be hard to do. How are winners selected?

<p><strong>Per <a href="http://www.trevorowens.com/trevor-owens-bio/" rel="nofollow">Trevor Owens</a>, CEO &amp; Founder of <a href="https://www.leanstartupmachine.com/" rel="nofollow">Lean Startup Machine</a>:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Winners are selected by a panel of judges, which may include
  investors, LSM Mentors, and LSM Alumni. We give the judges specific
  criteria to evaluate each team based on, and we have a blind voting
  system. It is not evaluated like a VC pitch, we focus the judges
  around the execution depth of learning a team has done.</p>
  
  <p>Usually the team that wins has collected a large amount of currency
  from customers, ie. $$, or has validated a concierge product.</p>
