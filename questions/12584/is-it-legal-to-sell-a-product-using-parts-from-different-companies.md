Sorry if this is ignorant or has already been asked...

Im building a desk pc and planing to sell it online on multiple sites. I want to confirm everything is legal and im not going to run into any problems down the road. Basically im using plywood, paint/stain, tempered glass, screws, adhesives, brackets, and lots of other hardware componits from other established companies  in my design; reselling it as an original product. Is there anything i need to check when using construction parts from other companies and is it legal. I am planning on including the names and links to all the parts i used in my design.

What you propose doing is what every other manufacturer is doing, to some degree or other. The car that's driving past your home is assembled using screws, bolts, nuts, and other pieces made by some other company. Some of the parts are, of course, made by the automaker, but others are not. Even those parts are made from "stock" made by someone else.

You have no need to include the names, sources, trademarks, or other information about the pieces you use. From a legal standpoint anyway. If you are using parts that are special in some way, then it _might_ be good to say so. For example, if the plywood is from a company that is known for being a _"Green"_, _local_ small business, or _ecofriendly_ company, and you want to also be known that way, then saying that you are using "exclusively" _such-and-such_ company's products could be a marketing tool. In doing so, you _may_ have to get permission to use their name. OTOH, in getting their permission, you may also be able to negotiate a better price since they will get brand exposure through your marketing as well.

I am guessing that "desk pc" means a computer that is built into the desk.
The elements of the computer are built-in and attached to the desk itself, not just a purpose-built cubbyhole to hold the computer built somewhere else. If that is correct, then if you install an operating system on the computer you will have to comply with licensing terms relative to that OS. The same applies to any other software you might install along side the OS.

A further consideration for the computer-in-a-desk concept is that there may be safety regulations to deal with. The computer will need electrical power, and the desk is made of wood. For example, together, wood and electricity can lead to fires. Any regulations in that area will be localized to where you are, and will need research on your own. Complying with them _may_ require some kind or warning labels or other stickers/plaques affixed to the desk, such as the Underwriters' Laboratories label on power cords in the USA, or the power labels on the back of television sets.
