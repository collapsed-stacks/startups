Does it make sense to start today a business which is completely based on website? Is there no market opportunity left there?
Should I instead focus on apps or something else?

There are plenty of web-based businesses and room for more. The main thing is if what your business is offering is something that would gain traction. I've started a couple web-based businesses and how well one of them did was based on what I was offering my customers. The other one is run purely as a job of passion. Study your ideal customer and think if what you're starting up is something that people are interested in buying or investing in.

Wow, that's an ***extremely*** broad question! (chuckle)  If you're asking whether or not it pays to launch a website-based business rather than creating apps, the answer is, *absolutely*!

There are **many** concepts for web-based businesses which may not translate well to being apps, so your only remaining choice is to go with a "more traditional" website.  

I, for one, prefer websites over apps because I don't like how cramped app screens are, but that may be a personal bias on my part.

Websites offering services which require quite a bit of data presentation may be better suited to a standard screen format rather than trying to shoehorn everything into a tiny app screen.

The PC market may be shrinking, but it's *far* from dead, so I think it's a bit early to hold a funeral for it just yet.  

There's nothing saying you can't offer *both* a website an accompanying app for people who prefer one over the other.  Perhaps they'll use the app when they're on the move and visit the website from their PC when they're at home or at the office.

The point is, don't cut your options short just because it *seems* like apps are taking over the world!
