<p>What do I need to do to have my blog be legally recognized as a business? Do I need to register somewhere? Do I need to incorporate? I am just starting a new blog. I know it's unlikely to be profitable and I don't have any plans to quit my day job to pursue it full time, but I would like to have all the legal stuff sorted out in case I manage to make an extra $50 bucks a month.</p>

<p>You can run your blog without worrying about being a business. For example you can run a free blog on tumblr with a custom domain name. They host millions of blogs, just imagine if every one of them would have to incorporate?</p>

<p>If you make some money on the side, you can file your taxes at the end of the year.</p>

<p>Not knowing much else about your blog, I would recommend looking at <a href="http://www.irs.gov/uac/Business-or-Hobby%3F-Answer-Has-Implications-for-Deductions" rel="nofollow">this from the IRS</a> about a Business vs a Hobby. It sounds like right now you may want to hold off on creating a business and just speak to a lawyer over IP and liability if you are concerned.</p>
