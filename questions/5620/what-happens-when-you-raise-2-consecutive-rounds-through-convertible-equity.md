<p>So we've raised an initial round through convertible equity &amp; are now looking to raise a new round, however due to the really high legal costs of an equity financing (around $5K-15K) compared to the small amount that we're raising, we're thinking of going for another convertible equity round. What would happen in this case? will the initial investment convert? or become a part of the new agreement, with special terms for those initial invests? I'd like to understand what happens here exactly? </p>

<p>It's probably fine, given the small amount. It's a little bit as if you had raised one convertible round with multiple investors the first time. This second investor just happens to be coming much later.</p>

<p>To know for sure, you'll need to read the terms of the first convertible note. It may contain a cap about extra capital raised before the conversion happens, but based on the small amount you are adding, it's unlikely to trigger, if the clause is there at all.</p>
