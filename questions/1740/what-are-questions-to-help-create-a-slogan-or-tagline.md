I'm working on our slogan / tagline.

I've done a fair amount of research. Lots of good suggestions out there for *goals* (memberable, unique, etc.)

But what would help even more is some good questions.

Here's what I've found so far:

1. What is your company's **mission**?
2. What are the **benefits and features** of your products or services?
3. What do your customers and prospects already **think** of your company?
4. What **qualities** do you want them to associate with your company?


Any other good questions?

Here are two more good questions:

- Is the slogan or tagline for the company or is it for a specific product?
- Is the slogan or tagline a semi-permanent one, or is it [for a specific campaign](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Apple_Inc._slogans)?

And this third one, which I think is even more important:

- Do you actually *need* a slogan or tagline, or spend resources coming up with the *perfect* one?

With respect to that last one in particular, a witty line counts rather less than a good looking logo in my experience. And you can actually make do without either, in the sense that both count *tremendously* less than a reasonably professional looking website.

As long as your site, or flyer, or docs, or what have you doesn't look amateurish, you're good to go and have *much* more important things to be worrying about. In particular, how to fill your sales funnel.

Once the latter is full, you can begin to worry about *improving* your conversion rates, and this can involve creating or revisiting a tagline. Ask your leads and your clients what they think; probe them for ideas. Until then, don't waste too much resources on this stuff.

Coming up with a good slogan can be a tricky thing.

Deviating a **little bit away** from your question (I'm an advertising student), I would like to point out a few Rule of Thumb for coining a slogan:

 1. Try to keep it short.
 2. It should be memorable.
 3. Use local language or everyday words.
 4. It should be easy to comprehend. (Avoid vague slogans like 'Your favourite brand'.)
 5. It should reflect your Brand Image. (To understand that, ask yourself these - What does your company stand for? What's your company's vision? Who do you cater to?)

**More Questions You Can Ask Yourself:**

 1. What is your **industry**?
 2. Who is your **target audience**?
 3. What are the **needs** of your target audience?
 4. What is your **USP** (Unique Selling Proposition)? Why should people use your product/service?
 5. What do you do **better** than your **competitors**?
 

Have a few brainstorming sessions. A couple of hours won't do justice. Spend at least 2-3 days on it and after you've come up with a few strong ones, **ask your family and friends** if they like it. Ask them what it implies (means to them). Their **honest feedback** will help you decide which one's the best.

Good luck!
