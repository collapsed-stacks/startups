<p>I'm working on our slogan / tagline.</p>

<p>I've done a fair amount of research. Lots of good suggestions out there for <em>goals</em> (memberable, unique, etc.)</p>

<p>But what would help even more is some good questions.</p>

<p>Here's what I've found so far:</p>

<ol>
<li>What is your company's <strong>mission</strong>?</li>
<li>What are the <strong>benefits and features</strong> of your products or services?</li>
<li>What do your customers and prospects already <strong>think</strong> of your company?</li>
<li>What <strong>qualities</strong> do you want them to associate with your company?</li>
</ol>

<p>Any other good questions?</p>

<p>Here are two more good questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is the slogan or tagline for the company or is it for a specific product?</li>
<li>Is the slogan or tagline a semi-permanent one, or is it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Apple_Inc._slogans" rel="nofollow">for a specific campaign</a>?</li>
</ul>

<p>And this third one, which I think is even more important:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do you actually <em>need</em> a slogan or tagline, or spend resources coming up with the <em>perfect</em> one?</li>
</ul>

<p>With respect to that last one in particular, a witty line counts rather less than a good looking logo in my experience. And you can actually make do without either, in the sense that both count <em>tremendously</em> less than a reasonably professional looking website.</p>

<p>As long as your site, or flyer, or docs, or what have you doesn't look amateurish, you're good to go and have <em>much</em> more important things to be worrying about. In particular, how to fill your sales funnel.</p>

<p>Once the latter is full, you can begin to worry about <em>improving</em> your conversion rates, and this can involve creating or revisiting a tagline. Ask your leads and your clients what they think; probe them for ideas. Until then, don't waste too much resources on this stuff.</p>

<p>Coming up with a good slogan can be a tricky thing.</p>

<p>Deviating a <strong>little bit away</strong> from your question (I'm an advertising student), I would like to point out a few Rule of Thumb for coining a slogan:</p>

<ol>
<li>Try to keep it short.</li>
<li>It should be memorable.</li>
<li>Use local language or everyday words.</li>
<li>It should be easy to comprehend. (Avoid vague slogans like 'Your favourite brand'.)</li>
<li>It should reflect your Brand Image. (To understand that, ask yourself these - What does your company stand for? What's your company's vision? Who do you cater to?)</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>More Questions You Can Ask Yourself:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>What is your <strong>industry</strong>?</li>
<li>Who is your <strong>target audience</strong>?</li>
<li>What are the <strong>needs</strong> of your target audience?</li>
<li>What is your <strong>USP</strong> (Unique Selling Proposition)? Why should people use your product/service?</li>
<li>What do you do <strong>better</strong> than your <strong>competitors</strong>?</li>
</ol>

<p>Have a few brainstorming sessions. A couple of hours won't do justice. Spend at least 2-3 days on it and after you've come up with a few strong ones, <strong>ask your family and friends</strong> if they like it. Ask them what it implies (means to them). Their <strong>honest feedback</strong> will help you decide which one's the best.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
