I have co-developed an app which is already being used by many schools in UK. It is targeted mainly towards pre-primary and primary schools to have a engaging, positive interaction with parents about what is happening in their classroom. 

I want to take this to Indian schools, but have no contacts in any educational establishment. Few emails that I sent out about the app were stone walled. How can I make contact with schools, should I contact the principal directly? I am pretty confident that once they see the app, they would really want to purchase it for their school. 

How do I get the initial breakthrough? Any advice?

In situations like this I ask myself: How would my wife want me to propose to her? On the phone? By email? A text? No. In person. 

Go to 10 schools next week and request a meeting with the principle. Be bold. Probably none will see you. But then try to see 10 more. Eventually one will sit down in a meeting with you. Once you show them that it's used in the UK and what it does, they'll take it (as you're claiming. HUGE plus that it's already being used in the UK). 

Once that school takes it, you can walk around to every Indian school and say that "other schools" are already using your technology. Everyone will take it because they don't want to fall behind! 

Contacts are difficult to make. I'm a developer as well. I've learned (hard way) that great technology/great ideas don't mean **anything** without *just* as great marketing or serious early-adopters. The only way to make them is to go out there and get them. 

Good-luck.

Find out where teachers hang out on the web and get your message there. The heads may hang out in different places to the teachers btw. Look at the media teachers may read, like TES in the UK (there must be more). Write a press release (with photo's) and send it to them. Journalists love a free story. Presumably there are conferences and events for head teachers, get there too.

Now try and get a meeting when the head has already heard of you...

Btw lots of people don't have a good enough memory to work out why they heard of you, just that you are familiar. Thats why having gone as far as to work out a school is in our target market, don't give it up so easily. Write to them personally, call them, pop by in person, send them a brochure. Send them some freebie materials (everyone loves a USB stick in the post don't they? This time of year everyone is looking for a desk calendar too, and maybe someone broke their mug today.). Then the next time you call, they may remember your name (not realising it was from the secretaries mug) and maybe tonight they have a meeting with the PTA and have been to busy to prepare, and your call is like mana from heaven! Persistence.

I had a guy call me every few months for a year, and I was always too busy, he dropped by to see me twice on the off chance and the second time causght me at a weak moment and I met him. One day he called by at a time when I needed his service. He must have called my company 10 times to get to me, he has called me and my boss at least 20 times since. He has sent several freebies including sweets! Eventually we have done some business with him. Two years work and counting.

I had a rep who had a sniff that we may need his service, and that the MD who needed to approve may be around for an hour at some point. He waited in our car park all afternoon, the MD happened to come in for 10 minutes between meetings and admired the guys pluckiness and said yes.

If you think you have a good lead, don't give up
