This might be treated as an irrelevant question, but to me it is very important. 

Before I take the plunge, I think it is a good idea to safe guard my family from the uncertainty over income from the startup. I've been thinking over it and would want to know how people in this community achieved it.

What could be the different ways to generate enough money so that my family's essential expenses are met.

A StartUp is not necessarily something highly scaleable or about focusing on an exit. Your goal should be to be successful (where as successful does not always mean to get rich - maybe it is something else you want to achieve).

So there you have it: Your goal could be generating passive income, with an relatively low investment. Which better place could exists, then the internet to achieve that? As software engineer you already have some advantages!

There are ways, to get some passive income quite fast, but honestly most of them are quite shady... Like SEO-Pages, which are focused on affiliate instead of creating real value for the user... As BrettFromLA said: investment of time or investment of money is more or less required to have an sustainable business...

So lets focus on solutions to lower your risks and have, at least, some securities.

- Work Part Time (just google it, how to arrange that) - Earn something without risks
- Work as a Freelancer (your job is just perfect for that) - Increases risks, but also has an higher average income, so less time to waste.
- Lean Start Up (just google it, what it is and how to achieve it) - Basically develop your product together with your customer.  Lowers investment and validates your product.
- Use your new skills to work with or around you product, validate your own skills etc. I'm developing a SaaS solution in the marketing sector. To improve and test my skills, I am offering consulting in cognate subjects. I'm quite successful with that.

I tried to go with a mixture of 2, (3) and 4.

These solutions will help you to earn some money, while creating your product/idea/service etc. But remember to stay focused. If you fail, you will have gained a lot of experience, but you will also have lost much time, which could be used better elsewhere.

Your problem now is, to find an idea, which will fit your requirements or convert it, so it matches an solution.

Not sure if that "solves" your problem. May leave a comment, if not.
