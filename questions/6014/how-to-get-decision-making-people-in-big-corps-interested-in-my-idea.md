<p>Let's say, I have a good model of some kind that cannot be leveraged at levels lower than key analyst in a big bank. I am at expert level in a pretty narrow field of study, the market for these ideas is tiny but high-ranked and educated. How to get these guys look from their skyscrapers down to my idea?</p>

<li><p>Publish a paper. The easiest way to get the interest of your target audience. Some of them probably read scientific journals. Although it might be harder to get accepted into a scientific journal, but once you do, you would get a huge deal of recognition.</p></li>
<li><p>Go to conferences where these guys hang out and present your model. Of course you would need to apply and get accepted but with your paper already published it wouldn't be that hard.</p></li>
<li><p>Go directly to them. Getting an interview isn't that hard especially if your invention is significant enough. Calling with a phrase "I have a model that guarantees you x profits" would most probably lend you an interview.</p></li>
<li><p>Can your model be made into a software or automated by software? If yes then you might be looking at a possible way of monetizing your invention.</p></li>
