I am in the process of building an app, and am soon to have an MVP.

Our target audience is very specific, owners of doggy day care centers. Was wondering what the best approach is to take to start getting feedback from such a narrow group of customers?

So far, all I can think of is to start cold calling them, and perhaps offer them free use of the product for helping us gain validated learnings.

Any feedback on this plan, or ideas for alternative plans is much appreciated.

I would suggest you start presenting your idea for the app to potential customers (your target group) at least to a small group of them. So your first step would be to get inside a meeting room with owners of dog day care centers. You can search for some creative approaches if they are hard to reach.

Then after presenting your idea of the app and its features you can ask them for feedback regarding what *they* would like to see in an app like that and what other problems they would like to solve. That way you could even get some ideas for future development.

Incentives such as free usage for the app for their help is something highly suggested.
