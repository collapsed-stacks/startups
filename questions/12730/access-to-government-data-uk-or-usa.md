I have an idea for which I would need to identify individuals. I do not need to store any identification data, just make the identification.

Is it possible for a company to get/buy access to government held data, such as Photo ID data?

If yes, to whom should one speak so as to initiate the data acquisition process?

If no, is there another way to get access to a data source which would allow me to make identifications?
