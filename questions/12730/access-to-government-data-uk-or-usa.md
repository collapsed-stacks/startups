<p>I have an idea for which I would need to identify individuals. I do not need to store any identification data, just make the identification.</p>

<p>Is it possible for a company to get/buy access to government held data, such as Photo ID data?</p>

<p>If yes, to whom should one speak so as to initiate the data acquisition process?</p>

<p>If no, is there another way to get access to a data source which would allow me to make identifications?</p>
