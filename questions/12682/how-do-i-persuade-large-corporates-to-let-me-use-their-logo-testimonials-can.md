I have written a piece of software which has had a reasonable uptake amongst some larger companies. One, at least, is a name most people would know (Think FTSE100).

To that end, I'd really like to include some form of testimonia, logo or name on my website. I think this is really important as a startup, as my product is niche and relatively unknown even within the industry.

My problem is that when I approach my contacts they often shy away, or offer to provide a "personal" testimonial. It's a nice gesture, but what I really want is for new customers to see that other large entities trust the product.

How do I structure the question to my customers? What can I do to make it easy for them to say yes?

As long as you haven't signed any kind of non-disclosure agreement with the company, they can't prevent you from stating on your website that the company is a customer.  Of course, they might decide to stop buying from you, so you do want to be careful.

I would state on your website that the company is a customer and not ask for permission to do so.  If they notice and complain, then you should take it down to maintain the relationship.

You could also put up a personal testimonial and say that the person works at the company.  For most people, it is public knowledge where they work because of LinkedIn.

You can't use a logo without permission because of trademark law.

There is a difference between "logo parade" and a testimonial.  The first one is simple enough as it is merely a statement of fact, not opinion.  The easiest way is to include this as a clause in your contract, terms of service, master service agreement or whatever document constitutes the purchase.  Sample included below.  

The testimonial is usually more personal.  You should specifically ask the person if they would mind providing a testimonial regarding your product or service.  It helps if you specifically ask them to highlight a certain aspect, like "resulted in decreased turnover" "fast implementation", etc.  Another approach is if they offer a compliment to your company, ask if they would mind it if you used that as a testimonial.
