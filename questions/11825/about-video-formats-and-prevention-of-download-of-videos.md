<p>Most computers and browsers supports H.264 format (I.e. mp4). So if you use h.264 format, it should play nicely across majority of desktop, mobile devices.</p>

<p>In terms of content protection, there is no way you can prevent users from downloading it to their own device. By default, in order to play the video, the device must download the data into device's memory. What you can do is make it harder by prevent user from right click and download. However, for someone with a bit of computer proficiency, they can still get pass it. </p>

<p>Hope this helped!</p>
