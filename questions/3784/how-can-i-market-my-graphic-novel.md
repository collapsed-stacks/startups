I'm the CEO/Designer/Developer of my company. I hire artists to create content for us that I sell... or at least that's the idea.

Just recently I've decided to take this startup to take it more seriously (since I work full time as a UX designer at a company). 

Currently we have a graphic novel in the works that's going to be the main selling point of our company. Yesterday I talked to a lawyer to make sure all things done are done in a valid way (legally speaking). But now I'm stuck. How do I start selling this graphic novel when it's finished? Should I look for a partner who's a marketing expert or should I hire outside help for this? I'm a one man shop (which I hate), but I haven't found someone I like as a partner (and am not rushing it), but is it vital to have a partner to make this all work?

Having worked in a large bookstore a bit over a decade ago back when eBooks were on everyone's radar but not quite there yet, a few ideas on how to sell a book:

 1. Ensure it's mentioned or reviewed by people who reach your target audience.
 2. If it's a physical book, organize reading and signing events with the author at bookstores, specialized trade shows, etc. In the case of a comic eBook, think custom picture signing events. You hopefully get the point: get authors to meet with readers.
 3. Have the author build an audience by blogging and guest-blogging: story and character background, "the making of" posts, bonus pictures, you name it. Ensure the audience finds this blog (see 1).
 4. Ensure the book itself has a proper landing page with some samples and so forth.
 5. Start promoting the book *before* it's finalized and published (points 1 and 3). Create a mailing list, and get potential readers to sign up and eagerly await the book's release.
 6. 2015-edition: organize a [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/discover/categories/comics) to "finish and print the book". Use the mailing list to feed the initial batch of backers and pre-sell the book.

Publishers have been mostly penniless in recent years because they got squeezed out of their margins by Amazon. As such, they usually stick to doing point 1 and hygienic amounts of 2.

Because of this, many an author will tell you that they do most of their promotion on their own dime. (They tend to make more from Amazon's affiliate commission, and that is part of why an industry trend is for authors to self-publish their own eBooks.)

The above list is probably not exhaustive, but it should get you started in the right direction. It's a lot of work, so [think twice](https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/3666/is-it-feasible-to-launch-an-app-working-alone/3671#3671) about going for it alone. (And don't hesitate to get in touch.)
