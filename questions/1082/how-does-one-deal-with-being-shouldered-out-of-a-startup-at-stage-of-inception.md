## How does one deal with being shouldered out of a startup at stage of inception?

<p>To put things into perspective - I had recently participated in a Start Up Weekend program. </p>

<p>My project pitch was not selected (although I did receive positive feedback) and so I joined another pitcher's team.</p>

<p>I worked hard and provided a good amount of useful input throughout the weekend (even provided the foundation for a rethink of their project when we hit the wall following their idea). </p>

<p>Overall the project was positively evaluated and the weekend ended - except that I am getting the feeling that my team mates are of the mind to cut me out at this stage.</p>

<p>Yes - feeling. I could be very wrong and it could be that these team mates are just 'resting' but communication has dwindled. It also doesn't help that of this team I was the only outsider - they otherwise all had strong working relationships - and my skill set is completely different to theirs.</p>

<p>As such - I guess I have two related questions here:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>How does one be certain that one is being shouldered out? and</p></li>
<li><p>What does one do to prevent (or at least deal with) being treated unfairly in such a circumstance (no contracts were signed)?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>"I went on a date this weekend. I pitched an idea for where to go, but they wanted to go somewhere else. I paid for the date and they had fun, but we have not talked about setting a date to get married, and that's what I want to do. How do I do this?"</p>

<p>First, in my opinion, startup weekends are not a bad place to look for cofounders, but they're not a great place either.</p>

<p>Next, a single weekend no matter how useful or productive does not make for a relationship. If there's no agreements, and you think the opportunity and your position to contribute is so great, just do the work and start your own company.</p>

<p>Lastly, stop assuming what they're thinking set a time to meetup find out what they need to move forward, offer to help and make your conditions of you helping clear up front, not after the fact.</p>

<p>Good luck, have fun, and always be selling the future you want.</p>

<p>A startup weekend does not a business make.  It is a great running start, but the company still has over 90% of the work left to have a complete product.</p>

<p>You ran with them for the first sprint.  You helped them refine <em>their</em> idea and bring it to a better, more viable state.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How does one be certain that one is being shouldered out?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There's no easy way to check.  Eventually they will formalize their relationships with each other and you will be included or not.  </p>

<p>There are some tell-tale signs that might help you measure this, though.  How much access do you have to the project work?  Is there a repository you do or do not have access to of documentation, code, designs, strategy?  Are people asking you questions or keeping you in the loop?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What does one do to prevent (or at least deal with) being treated unfairly in such a circumstance (no contracts were signed)?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Be consistently valuable.  Prove to them that you are excited about the project, that you have a lot of value to it, and that you are willing to go the distance.  Show them this through your work efforts.</p>

<p>Keep yourself in the loop.  Keep track of the project status, anticipate the next work product needed, and work on it, asking for feedback and status from others on other aspects of the project.</p>

<p>If they are actively working to shut you out it will be pretty obvious if you integrate yourself into their team.  If they aren't actively working to shut you out, then you will be able to force yourself in.</p>

<p>Keep track of all correspondence and work you produce for the project.  If they accept your work and continue working with you, then suddenly leave you in the cold once a contract is written, you can use this as evidence that you have some rights to the company (though, honestly, it's all bitterness and unhappiness from here, but that's your choice).</p>

<p>If you want to force their hand, pursue legal agreements early on in the relationship.  Help them understand that entering a legal contract relationship will only help them in the future, now that the idea has legs.  If nothing comes of it, no problem, but if something does come of it no one will be blind to the part they play and the ownership they have, if any, in the project.</p>

<p><strong>Startup Weekends and similar events are learning and networking experiences</strong> first and foremost. Yes, it's brilliant if some teams or projects go forward, but that's the exception, not the norm. </p>

<p>In my experience (I've run public and private events under various brands and formats, and love to do it!), people's first experience can be a bit disorienting. Some people come to pitch their great idea, don't get a team, go away disillusioned, and miss out. And others are excited by the process, but confused by the way that as the event finishes and Monday looms into view, the team reconfigures or fades away. The strong sense of shared ownership 36 hours means you can feel something has been taken away from you.</p>

<p>My advice is, <strong>sign up for another upcoming event</strong>. Next time you'll bring the experience of the whole cycle, and you'll be better at working out what kind of team you'd enjoy being part of and bring something distinctive to. And you can also decide whether you're looking for a fun project never mind Monday, a potential business that could start to crystallise, a group of people you can imagine founding with, or any other of the many available trajectories.</p>

<p>Listen to your gut.</p>

<p>If you're unhappy with the level of communication then discuss it with the team directly or test the waters. Frankly though, if you can't get the basics down at this early stage, with you and they being open about it, then it's not going to work out. I make sure I'm in alignment with who I'm working with before I invest too much.</p>

<p>Don't let yourself be strung along either. Chalk it up to experience and create another start-up with more compatible partners.</p>
