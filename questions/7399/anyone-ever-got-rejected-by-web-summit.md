My company has just been selected for Web Summit 2015. 

Has anyone been 'rejected' from the selection process before?<br >
 I'd like to check on their authenticity.

No need to clarify which web summit - the startup community knows the background story of The Web Summit and it's reputation. And no, I haven't heard of rejected startups.

What happened a few years ago to a friend and their startup was they passed several application rounds, incl. they had to ask their friends on social media to vote for them. In the end the organisers told them they successfully qualified to attend and now have to pay 3k to visit (was not mentioned earlier). Since all their network was already involved they couldn't reject the invitation and took part, but felt scammed.

<p>There are numerous "summits" either on line or in person. My company would be invited to about 4 per year. It is often on the basis of the description of what we do and the core focus of the event.</p>

<p>You will be being approached either to exhibit or as an attendee.</p>

<p>Going as an attendee will probably teach you some good stuff, as long as it's not too expensive. If it is a "web only" attendance you have then the value is less. Remember you can hear a lot of these speakers for free already on <a href="https://www.ted.com/" rel="nofollow">Ted talks</a>.</p>

<p>The exhibiting ones are typically Â£10-50k mark (for Europe), offering sometimes on-on-one meetings with selected individuals. It sounds OK to be fair, especially if you can grab a large project, but these things, I think are long shots for smaller businesses, unless you are very niche and your competition is very poor</p>

<p>We havn't chosen to go with any of them as yet.</p>
