If I want to raise funds by diluting equity of my startup, how can I calculate the valuation of a startup (that might not look as sexy as the product startups)?

If the company is less than 3 years old, will it work accordingly as well?

Keep in mind that individual investors typically have their own method of placing a value on your business.  To give you some insight on the complexity, to have a formal business valuation or 409A performed, it typically costs upwards of $10K or more.  

In order to have a meaningful discussion and/or negotiation, you will need a compelling argument.  If your company has revenue/sales but is unprofitable, you can use a multiple of that number as a basis (this is a weak position).  The more common valuation is a multiple of EBITDA.  The multiple is generally 3-5 times EBITDA, or you can use SDA - "seller discretionary earnings" which is EBITDA plus some "add-backs" such as owner salary and other non-essential operating costs (car lease, moving expenses, theft, etc).  So if your EBITDA or SDA for 2016 was $50,000 then your company valuation could be as high as $250,000 (5 multiple x $50K).  So if your investor is willing to give you $25,000 then a fair offer would be 10% of equity / 10% of shares.

It's not clear if your startup is actually up and running or generating revenues, so here is a great article on pre-market valuations:
