<p>I have a solution to a problem in an industry I am just a user of. I don't work in the industry. So I am not sure my idea really solves a significant problem. However I can provide the technology. My first rounds of web research shows the solution is better than existing tools.</p>

<p>So I think about partnering with a domain expert (as co-founder, or first user). However I need to make sure that the domain expert doesn't simply go away with the idea and find another technical provider.</p>

<p>I am not sure to what extent an NDA would protect me. What are the best practices for such partner communications?</p>

<p>The best practices are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Sign an NDA.  Make sure it that it provides you with adequate legal protection (e.g., long enough term) and also has clear, strong language that indicates it is a binding legal agreement.  Part of the reason of signing an NDA is psychological to scare people into compliance.</li>
<li>Only talk to people you trust. Most people will be strangers but be on the lookout for any red flags.</li>
<li>Don't say more than you need to.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Nobody will sign an NDA</strong> as a way of discovering whether you have an idea that has value. At least, nobody who has competence and ambition in your target market. No business angel, no prospective cofounder.</p>

<p>So in those conversations, you have to find ways of describing your idea that <strong>don't disclose your secret sauce</strong>.</p>

<p>If I'm pitching an idea of this sort, my default is to use that useful formula:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Why <em>this</em>?</p></li>
<li><p>Why <em>me</em>?</p></li>
<li><p>Why <em>now</em>?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If you prepare a pitch like this, an immediate benefit is that you get a more interesting range of answers to "How do you do that?" than <em>"Sorry, I'm not willing to tell you."</em> You can talk about <strong>your idea</strong> (without describing it in technical detail), you can talk about <strong>your credentials</strong>, and you can talk about the reasons <strong>why the world is ready</strong> for an idea like this.</p>

<p>At some point, you may need an NDA. For instance, if you believe your idea contains valuable and protectable IP, you ought to have a discipline of never disclosing key details without an NDA in place. But that's downstream of where you are now.</p>

<p>Step one is to learn <strong>how to qualify prospective partners</strong> and <strong>how to allow prospective partners to qualify you</strong> by practising with a good friend <strong>having purposeful and meaningful conversations about your proposal <em>without</em> disclosing secrets</strong>.</p>
