<p>From your own startups experience, who was the one to manage the first developers hired? And Why? </p>

<p>Also, was it a techy startup and how many founders you had / what were their roles at the time? </p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Normally, it would be the person who has best business/technology knowledge balance. If you are hiring multiple developers, perhaps one of these developers could serve as lead, provided that person has seniority and experience - so you might look for that int. If you have little to no experience in tech and/or management, you should look to hire someone who does.</p>

<p>If you have to ask...   ...you're probably missing a founder.</p>

<p>If you don't have the experience to lead a development team, you're probably better off outsourcing.</p>

<p>structures of techy startups I participated in (bold lead the dev team(s) directly):</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>CEO</strong> &lt;- failed, ceo incompetence</li>
<li>CEO/CMO/HR, <strong>CEO/COO/CFO</strong> &lt;- failed, problem with market readiness</li>
<li><strong>CEO</strong>, CMO, CTO, COO/CFO &lt;- failed, ceo incompetence/sabotage</li>
</ul>

<p>In my last startup it was the CTO, but he was also the only one who wanted this job. Me and a friend made quite a research on the CTO roles, and it seems like in the vast majority of cases its the CTO who takes the team leader role until the team grows big enough. more info here: <a href="http://ctorole.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://ctorole.com/</a></p>
