Ok, I am working as a marketing representative for a autism school startup. The school is pretty small as it only has 9 students.

Recently, an autism association will open an autism workshop for connecting parents that have autistic children. The autism association sent an email inviting our school attending their workshop. 

So, that is a very good chance for us to find more customers or potential customers and generate sales leads.

My question is that what should  I effectively do to utilize that workshop for finding more customers and increase the image of our school to many people?

Here is what I think up:
<pre>
-Give parents our brochures
-Some customers need a specific technical info then our specialists will answer them 
-Approach to potential customers and introduce our school to them
-Introduce our school on the stage to all audiences
-Give web links, and show videos to them. Maybe we can have an iPad in our table 
(we gotta pay the association for renting that table). We can show our video on 
iPad to the customers
-Give free gifts (like book or T-Shirt) for customers
</pre>

The best write-up I've ever seen on the topic was a two part post by Steve Blank:

- [Part 1: Marketing owns it - Generate awareness](http://steveblank.com/2009/05/21/trade-shows/)
- [Part 2: Sales owns it - Generate leads](http://steveblank.com/2009/05/22/trade-shows-part-1/)

It's technically advice for trade-show goers, and Steve suggests that the advice is primarily for old-school businesses (I disagree), but I'm pretty sure you'll find a wealth of good ideas in there.

Quoting part 1 at length:

> Pick just one or two key ideas that you want to get across at the show

The only thing I'd add is: **try to come with a client or two**. Nothing sells better than a happy client who is explaining to an audience of prospects all the great benefits they're getting from doing business with you.

> What should a marketing representative of a startup do in a workshop or any event relating to their field?

The same thing as all other marketing efforts; I believe the answer boils down to one simple thing: *generate marketing qualified leads*.

A MQL is someone with genuine interest in the company you're representing. Basically this means he/she converges into a sale or can get picked up by the sales process. The latter f.ex. means a talk with a sales rep, a direct sale or a specialist.

The fundamental difference between a MQL and a SQL (Sales Qualified Lead) is that an MQL is usually created by 'passive awareness', while a SQL is usually created by pro-actively reaching out. You can do that with buttons, flyers, events, newsletters, a website, newspapers, bring specialists / customers, buying adwords / linkedin / facebook ads and everything fancy you can think about that 'tickles' potential customers. Be creative.

The important thing here is to *measure* MQL, the effect of your actions on MQL's and the sales pipeline after the MQL's. In other words: define the MQL in such a way that you can *count* them, preferably leading the lead back to a source (that's the tough part). Once you do that, you can see the impact your actions have on MQL's and you can predict the amount of (both direct and indirect) sales the marketing efforts are generating. 

Making this distinction will give you much more control over your own marketing process than just looking at sales leads. In my experience, MQL's are different from SQL's, because they usually have a different convergence rate. Getting a grib on MQL's will also give you the information you need for business cases irt marketing efforts that costs money.

Next, cut things that don't work and start to experiment on new things to see if they work.
