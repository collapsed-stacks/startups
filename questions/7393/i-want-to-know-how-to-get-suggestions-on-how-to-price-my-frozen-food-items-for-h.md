Food is in local supermarkets at 169 baht(I'm located in Thailand and selling food to foreigners).

Attaching images with prices I think are ok, but I feel my pricing structure is wrong.

Additionally, I would like to do a discount for the first flyer run.

Cost for coke and chip is 18 baht, cost to make the product is 40 baht, easier to understand if looking at the flyer:

When I interpret your flyer correctly, you seem to offer a product below the price of the competition while also adding additional value by providing free home delivery. Considering that you offer additional value, you *should* be able to charge even more. But when introducing a new product, doing price dumping can be a good strategy to establish a customer base.

You might want to check your expense calculation, though. Supermarkets are usually highly efficient and have low profit margins. It is unlikely that you can compete on price alone. Is 58 baht really the only cost you have? What about the labor cost for making and delivering the product? What about administrative overhead? What about taxes? What about marketing expenses? What about losses due to orders which the customer don't accept? What about the 20 or so other hidden cost factors I don't think of right now?
