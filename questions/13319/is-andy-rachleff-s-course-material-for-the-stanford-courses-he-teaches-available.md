I'm interested in his lecture notes if anyone can point me to them. Iâ€™m not necessarily interested in viewing/listening to the lectures themselves though that would be a very nice bonus. He teaches product-market fit and innovation. His Stanford faculty page: https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/faculty/andrew-s-rachleff
