In the UK, in the past, companies like Amazon were known for sending all their parcels from offshore locations in order to take advantage of better tax conditions (or perhaps loopholes).  

Are there any countries that intentionally try to draw in start-ups? More specifically, I'm thinking of IT start ups, but any other area might be of interest too. I'm thinking of tax benefits, grants, or other 'goodies' to encourage commerce. 

Israel, for example, prides itself on being a very [startup-oriented economy][1], but I'm not sure if they actively try to draw in business people.

<p>Chile is a strong contender, with it's <a href="http://startupchile.org/">Start-Up Chile</a> programme. They provide selected startups with a 1 year visa for the whole team, and also 40,000 USD as an equity-free grant. </p>
