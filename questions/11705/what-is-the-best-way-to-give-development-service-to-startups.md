Just post on freelancing websites. Make sure you have a portfolio and past project rates. You can also set up a package-type offer and market it as a benefit on F6S or for members co-working workspaces (like WeWork), but it would mostly be marketing then (i.e. loss-leader). And if I may suggest how NOT to market your services to startups: by looking up the Whois of recently registered domains and SPAMing their owners.

1 . First select who is your audience ? 
    ( Funded startups or Unfunded startups )

2 . Select the kind of services that startups are hunting for .                   
    (Technical , Market research , Data accumulation , Clients acquisition )

3 . Can you provide services single handedly or with a team ?       
                 
 4 . If single handedly ? Then start selling yourself from joining local startup 
     community , listen to their technical requirement etc .

 5.  If you suffice their requirement approach them confidently , If not then 
    learn something on their requirement .  

6 . Build projects by yourself or team and add it to github or other famous 
     portal . So that your project will be included in the search results 
     (Google).    

All the best .
