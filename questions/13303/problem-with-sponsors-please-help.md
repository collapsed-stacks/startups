<p>I have a desperate situation and I don't know how to resolve it. Here is the problem. I'm trying to get a sponsor for event where I will be speaking but the meeting is in another country and I wouldn't be able to attend due to the reason that I don't have much money to cover the expenses of the trip. I found several sponsors who agreed to become a sponsor of the speech but only after in person meeting. It's difficult to say that I have no money to being able to meet with them in person. So if you had a similar situation how would you resolve it? Is there a way or specific websites where I can get a sponsor by speaking on Skype or phone without in person meeting? Thank you for your help!</p>

<p>As describe by your situation the main problem is money for your trip?
So as per my opinion</p>

<ol>
<li>First to convention sponsor to you are real and hard worker and show register no or any legal authorisation if you have.</li>
<li>Or contact any online or social friend or person who you know and live in sponsor country and pay some amount for attend meeting with you sponsor.</li>
<li>Or signed any legal contract or NDA so, sponsor trust you as you are legal.</li>
</ol>
