<p>I have a great startup with a great product. But I have an extremely terrible website. I need to revamp the design, architect the website content and copy. I just don't know how to start. I am not sure what to label what I am looking for? Marketing expert? Graphic Designer? Content Creative?</p>

<p>Can I outsource this work? What kind of companies do such services?</p>

<p>You'll want all three in practice. You can outsource this work to any marketing agency or graphic design shop worth its salt. Even to a professional copywriter - they'll invariably know a few designers.</p>

<p><em>But</em>... one thing they can't do for you, or rarely well enough anyway, is figuring out what should go in the copy. It's one thing to write salesy tripe, it's another to become intimate enough with <em>your</em> client needs that you're able to write copy that sells.</p>

<p>For that you <em>need</em> to have a marketer in your team, if only temporarily. Or at the very least <em>you</em> need take the steps on your end to pave the way forward by knowing your clients like the back of your hands. If you're unable to precisely tell whoever you outsource this to what needs to go in the copy, contractors will rarely go the extra mile and actively talk to your prospects (not unless you explicitly pay them to do this anyway); rather, they'll try to guess what the clients want and call it a day.</p>
