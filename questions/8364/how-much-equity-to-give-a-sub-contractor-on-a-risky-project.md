<p>I have a new venture: A website that deals in Travel.  I own 100% and am more than capable of bring it and a whole range of products and services to market.  I've done it before. It is selling well, and I'm expecting profitability soon.</p>

<p>Inside this website I would like to develop an additional service that requires more techical skill than I can muster.  It is quite heavily mathematical and I'd like to bring other people onboard to help with specifically this subproject only.</p>

<p>The service's offering would be initally sold through my website and subsequently could sell directly, in a spun off form, or merged into my operation.</p>

<p>I intend to setup a new incorporation specifically to perform this service.  The idea being that it doesn't affect the equity of the mother-ship website</p>

<p>I've found a contractor who is prepared to work at 50% his normal rate in return for 50% equity of the subproject.  I will be paying his salary from my savings. There are no VCs.</p>

<p>I believe he has the technical capability to do this although it is a bit of a moonshot.  It is probably 3 months before we see if its a "Go" - and maybe 1 year to market. 
Is this a reasonable split?  </p>

<p>My feeling would be that he is still getting "some" pay, so I'm bearing more of the risk, so should take more of the equity.</p>

<p>Please feel free to give quick feedback on this specific situation - I'd really appreciate some heads-up on this!</p>

<p>Do you have money to pay him for 1 full year? If not, then don't even start..</p>

<p>Imagine if you are in the middle of the project and you runs out of money. You'll find yourself in a bizarre situation with <strong>1)</strong> no money <strong>2)</strong> 50% less equity <strong>3)</strong> an angry partner/employee.</p>

<p>Like <em>@HenryTaylor</em> have already mentioned, you could wait until your core service start making (more) money and with that you could pay the technical guy <strong>without bleeding your equity</strong>.. (or even give him a minor stack just to keep him motivated).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Another thing to keep in mind is how difficult it is to split -
  legally speaking - the sub-product/service from the main one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You could be setting up a time bomb for yourself if you don't get proper advice on the contract - I'm assuming you were thinking in put all the terms in a contract, right?</p>

<p><strong>So, my advice is don't rush yourself.</strong> </p>

<p>But if you are really thinking about make this sub-project happen NOW, try to find a technical partner who is willing to go full commited with you : 50% equity, no salary. </p>

<p>I know it is tough, but maybe we're facing one of 2 situations here:</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> Your sub-project is not sexy enough (so people want money to
    work for it)</p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> You are not selling the idea in a sexy way (maybe is a great
    idea, but people are not buying your vision).</p>

<p>Regardless of your answer you'll have some homework to do.</p>
