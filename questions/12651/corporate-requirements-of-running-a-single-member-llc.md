<p>I'm considering inching my way into business as a software contractor. I currently have a day job, which I have no intention of quitting unless or until this contractor job becomes clearly sustainable.</p>

<p>The most likely scenario is that every few years, I'll do a small bit of work as a contractor. I could possibly get away without incorporating, but would still like to do so. I'd like a corporation that just sits dormant until I need it, and the goes back to dormancy for months or years.</p>

<p>I've read that single member LLC is the way to go for this. Its tax status as a disregarded entity makes handling the taxes as painless as possible (though from what I understand, not necessarily as cheap as possible).</p>

<p>But are there other obligations I would need to fulfill? Aside from counting income from it on my tax return, is there any other obligation or reporting I would need to do?  What does it take to maintain a (single member) LLC from year to year? I'd welcome any resources that are out there as recommended reading.</p>

<p><a href="https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/241/what-is-the-ballpark-total-cost-to-register-an-llc-in-texas">What is the ballpark total cost to register an LLC in Texas?</a> mentions that I would need a registered agent, but it could be myself.  I see from <a href="https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/1/is-my-llc-required-to-have-a-registered-agent">Is my LLC required to have a registered agent?</a> that at least in New Hampshire, it's highly recommended that you have a registered agent.  In the interest of keeping things as cheap as possible, since the first link recommends being your own registered agent as the cheapest alternative, I think I will follow that advice.</p>

<p>I started following the advice from <a href="https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/7842/what-are-requirements-to-open-llc-in-usa">What are requirements to open LLC in USA?</a>.  <a href="https://direct.sos.state.tx.us/help/help-corp.asp?pg=fee" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://direct.sos.state.tx.us/help/help-corp.asp?pg=fee</a> does show that forming a Texas entity will cost $300; I don't see a line-item for how much it would cost to maintain per year.  Am I right that it's free?</p>

<p>I'm posting an answer as I learn it from research.  I would still very much welcome answers from those of you who are more experienced than I.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.sos.state.tx.us/corp/forms/205_boc.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">state llc certificate of formation</a> mentions that this kind of LLC would be subject to a <a href="https://comptroller.texas.gov/taxes/franchise/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">state franchise tax</a>.  If I'm reading the chart correctly, if the company's income is less than $1,110, I would have no tax liability, and I could claim up to $360,000 in fair market compensation, which would almost certainly be a higher threshold than I'll reach (at least as a single member).  But either way, the company would be liable for filing tax forms by May 15 of each year.</p>
