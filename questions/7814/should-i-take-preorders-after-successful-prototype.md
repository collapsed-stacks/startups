I have a guitar amplifier I invented that uses a handmade wooden cabinet with some very simple electronics inside that do "something different". I have built everything myself. The proto is cheap wood but it looks fine to photograph. The production versions will use higher quality wood and assembly. The reason I haven't built a production version is because I can't justify the time/cost commitment until I know people want me to build them. 

Do you think it's OK for me to already go ahead and make a video and take preorders with the prototype? I feel confident that I will find the space and resources I need to fullfill the orders but I would like to have some orders secure before I do that.
