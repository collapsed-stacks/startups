I am a developer with expertise in document management. I have written both document management and litigation review (lot of commonalities to document management).  Azure has recently added Search and Machine Learning and is perfect platform for some stuff I want to do. I would write directly to specific Product (E.G. SQL Azure, Blob storage) not buy a virtual server. You get a lowest cost. Potential customer would have those Azure services in their name. They can backup using Azure products. I don't touch the data - I don't want to touch the data. A challenge is my target customer(s) would need to be huge. If you have a cost advantage of $1 / gb / month then it has to be TB of data to make a difference. I have some good demo data - easy to show the value of the software. Something like a hospital, health care provider, or data broker. Not targeted for a commercial store front. For something like data extortion hacks cloud is actually safer. The target is lots of data,  they want a cloud model, and they want total control.  Since I would need to release my software to the customer (with proper license) I do not want to test / build the market with smaller customers. Even with a proper license people will steal your IP.

I would rather control cost and minimize risk and making a living than swing for the fence for big payout.  It would cost me very little more than my time.  In a development and demo environment my Azure cost would be less than $50.  It would take me about 6 months as I know the design and exactly how I want to do it.  Not saying prior software is trashy just this is enough different that I want to start fresh and I need really clean code if it is going to be potentially be released to the customer.

Possible exit strategies

 - Hope for a big boy to just buy me out. Ownership of the software.  Swing for the fence.
 - Try and license to some big provider(s). Biggest concern is
   protecting my IP and liability. In a dispute on a license right
   now.  Would have high cost in attorney fees.  Not just initial license but providers would want to review the license with my attorney.
 - Sell direct to small companies is not an option. It has to be in the
   TB range. The product is not the same as a GoogleDocs but you can get
   10 gb on GoogleDocs for free.
 - A model that looks attractive is Open Source via something like
   GitHub
   - It seems to limit my risk 
   - Low legal cost. Many tested licenses for free
   - I get customers to test 
   - If customers hate it I will find out early
   - Developers to test  
   - I am more a back end guy.  In an ideal world would get font end guy (or girl) to join in.
   - I will actually start with WPF client. It is about speed and features. So much more you can do with a full .NET behind you. For one recoverable data loader.  With a WCF service could also do Explorer integration. It would be if an ASP.NET or ASP.NET MVC joined in. 
   - I see other companies do it. Alfresco one of the big players does it.
   What they typically don't include is options to scale and I can't do
   that. Azure provides the scale and I have no means of withholding
   that. But I still like the model.
   - I could sell related software services. I think I can even sell
   warranties / support. Different business domains would have different
   needs and likely want some tweaks to the UI. I think big cloud
   customers will be more likely to go with Open Source as it is a data
   security thing - total control. If I can get $10,000 in consulting or warranty from 10 accounts in a year that is $100,000. I am happy with that. 
   - I guess a startup that wants to manage the business side might offer to bring me on as the tech guy. I don't really want to be the lead tech guy. I am a back end.

**What path seems like the best?  Am I missing something thinking Open Source is the best?**
