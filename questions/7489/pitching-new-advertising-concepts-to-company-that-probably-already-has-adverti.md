<p>Say I had a few ideas for advertising campaigns/tactics especially using interactive technology.</p>

<p>(as opposed to standard print/web content/TVC/traditional advertising).</p>

<p>Being interested in this kind of thing, I think of an idea, implement it, and then apply it as follows: </p>

<p><em>'With a small tweak here and there to align strategy, this could be <strong>great</strong> for company X to sell its product B'</em></p>

<p>Naively my approach would be direct, approach them relatively 'off the street' - pitch it - see what happens...</p>

<p>Ah but questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>How best to go about this?</p></li>
<li><p>What, if anything, am I not considering?</p></li>
<li><p>By 'them', would I do best to approach the company, or it's
advertising co. ? (and what is the job title in general of the person I would address?)</p></li>
<li><p>Assuming I'm on target, how do I protect my concept from them just running with it or some
version of it without me?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Getting a contract with an advertising company would be an acceptable outcome, as long as I was given share in the creative credit so I could move forward in establishing my position later down the line.</p>

<p>So do you have ideas or an actual product?</p>

<p>Let's evaluate both scenarios anyway:</p>

<p><strong>1o scenario -</strong> You have awesome ideas that could easily boost a company campaign and you'd like to profit (or at least get some credit) from it:</p>

<p>It's very nice that you are a smart guy but unfortunately this won't be enough. I mean, ideas, as you've noticed, are very easy to be stolen. </p>

<p>But if you want to put those ideas out there to work anyway I would suggest:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Land a job on advertising industry and prove to others (and yourself) you have ideias no one else have ever imagined or executed. If you are really good and creative, soon you will have your chance to shine and get all the credits you've been dreaming about.</p></li>
<li><p>Give your ideas for free. Yes, why not? Call some Creative Services Director and tell him you'd like to exchange some ideas on the use of interactive technlogy. Be clear that you don't want to charge or sell anything to him. If he <strong>really likes</strong> your ideas, he will probably admire your attitude as well and then, maybe, he would offer you something.. that's your chance to discuss with him how you could help, maybe a contract could come up...</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2o scenario -</strong> Now if you want to offer more than ideas - like having your own company, I would suggest:</p>

<p><strong>Productize your service:</strong> Maybe you could create a consulting company specialized in the use of interactive technology for the advertising industry.</p>

<p>You risk the idea being offloaded to their agreed partner. They might have a legal contract that prevents them seriously considering your proposal. They could forward your idea on, the contracted partner could take your idea and nothing you can do about it. Case in point are chocolate maltesers. Some years ago someone wrote an idea to the company and months later seen their idea on tv. The BBC news website did a piece on it I think. Its a risk.</p>

<p>An alternative solution is fund the idea yourself and try market it as a solution to the existing marketing company. I have a Brazilian friend who part owned a company in Rio tat did just this. They created their own ideas, put together professional video and approached a number of existing marketing companies. They made a small fortune and won recognition at Cannes film festival!</p>

<p><em>Confessions of an Advertising Man</em> by a chap called David Ogilvy.. Its old but excellent. There is an hour long documentary which is also excellent but will offer you fewer lessons than the book.</p>

<p>Best of luck!</p>
