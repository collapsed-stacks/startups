My partner and I have recently moved to Washington DC and since many people here come to live from other states and countries, we decided to revitalize an old way of communicationâ€”through postcards. We had a very hard time finding cool postcards, so we created our own. [This is what we created][1]

We made our own artwork and printed these pieces of art on thick matte paper. We want to use this way of communciation not only for sendng messages to friends, but also to the government. It is beautiful and concise.

We are experiencing difficulties launching. What would be your advice? We really need some ideas on how to promote a very niche product. :)

Cheers,

Oleg and Ramon

Since you are trying to sell a physical product, create a bunch of postcards and send them to a bunch of different addresses in Washington (or deliver them yourself). Since those postcards are not the average commercial mail we all frequently get and all so love, I'm sure lots of people will actually look at it closer. You can tell them about the company website and the purpose of it and the reader can also automatically judge your handwriting. 

Also, nowadays, lots of people just send postcards for special occasions anymore (if even), such as birthdays, Eastern, Christmas, etc. Create some postcards that capture those occasions as well (maybe you did and I missed that on your website?). That way you'll get a few more customers and if they and the postcard receivers love it, chances are you'll continue selling more 'non-special occasion' cards as well.
