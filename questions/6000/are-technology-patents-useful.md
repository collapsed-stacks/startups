<p>A friend tells me it's not worth it to get a patent on a web application because they are not useful. Either the USPTO has stopped granting patents on "process" improvements (i.e. web apps) or they are not useful once granted.</p>

<p>Take, for example, the fact that Amazon technically <a href="http://www.google.com/patents/US5960411" rel="nofollow">owns the patent for selling stuff over the internet</a>.</p>

<p>So I ask this community:</p>

<p>Things to consider:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Will it help?</strong> These days we're living in a world where a company the other side of the planet can compete with you. So will just having a US patent help you?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Is it worth the money?</strong> Getting a patent, especially if you want to get international patents too (see previous point), is a non-trivial expense. Is it better to spend that money elsewhere in your startup?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Could you afford to defend it?</strong> Having a patent doesn't mean other people automatically never infringe on it. You have to defend it. In court. Can you afford the expensive in time, money and people?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Is it defendable:</strong> Just because you get a patent granted <em>does not</em> mean that there isn't something out there that will mean it gets struck down at a later date. Can you survive without the patent?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>All this has to be balanced against how valuable you think the technological innovation is.</p>
