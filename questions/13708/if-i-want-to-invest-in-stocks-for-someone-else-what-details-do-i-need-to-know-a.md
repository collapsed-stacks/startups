<p>I am creating a trading platform for stocks.<br>
I want users to be able to buy and sell their stocks in the platform.<br>
In most sites that i visited i saw that if a user wants to buy stocks through the site, the site requires many details such as id, address, income, and much more.<br>
I want to create a platform that requires minimal details from the user.<br>
If i invest in stocks for the user why would i need so much information about him?<br>
What is the minimal information that i need from the user that wants to buy stocks using my platform?</p>

<p>Assuming you are in the US, it is because of legal issues of course. </p>

<p>Although what you propose is doable, it is far from easy.</p>

<p>You probably thought about this, but a few points:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Since you will be holding people's money before they buy and after they sell you will likely need to be registered with at least one government banking agency.</p></li>
<li><p>Since you will be an intermediary for buying and selling stock you will have to register with the appropriate securities agency. How will you fulfill the orders?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I suggest you get a lawyer versed in setting up securities companies as there are a lot of loops you'll have to jump through. At least in the US.</p>
