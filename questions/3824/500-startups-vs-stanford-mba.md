<p>I have an A/B choice here.</p>

<p>I can join some friends at 500 startups, and become a 500 startups alumni (but I won't get any shares of this company, I just join them for the program duration)</p>

<p>Or</p>

<p>I can join a Stanford MBA about entrepreneurship (I won't pay, I have scholarship)</p>

<p>I know which one will teach me more (500 startups I guess) but here my question is really which one sounds better from a VC point of view.</p>

<p>Which one will sound better in a VC's ear ? And look better on my pitch deck's mini resume ?</p>

<p>Thanks !</p>

<p>I think you may be underestimating the potential learning experiences at the Stanford MBA program. A good network of alumni, great professors and talented classmates will guarantee a great learning at your MBA program. I would suggest taking the MBA specially since you have scholarship and will not need to take debt to finance it. While at the MBA program you can find potential co-founders and build out your idea.</p>

<p>In terms of looking better from a VC point of view, it is not a secret that many people have bias towards graduates from some elite schools (e.g. <a href="https://www.quora.com/Does-Silicon-Valley-overvalue-degrees-from-prestigious-universities" rel="nofollow">see this</a>). Overall, when compared with the second option of joining a founding team without equity, a Stanford MBA sounds a lot better.</p>

<p>I personally do not think MBAs provide you with much educational benefits, but it having an MBA will provide you with 2 key items - a helpful alumni network and a higher base salary.</p>

<p>The level of work you do is what matters to a VC.  If you are doing more lower level work at 500 startups now, then that will not be as impressive as getting an MBA and having a unique internship on your resume so you can apply for a more senior role later.  If you are able to land a great job now that will be great on your resume, than do that instead of the MBA.  Think of the MBA as a launching pad if you are not happy with the jobs you can get right now.</p>
