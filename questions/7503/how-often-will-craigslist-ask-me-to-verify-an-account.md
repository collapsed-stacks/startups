I am trying to advertise my business through craigslist but I am constantly getting bombarded by my competition's seemingly endless amount of ads. So I am trying to produce multiple craigslist profiles to post more ads.

I have 5 profiles that are verified and it was a pain to get them verified.

I am wondering now that I have my profiles verified, is it possible to post multiple ads on those craigslist profiles without craigslist asking me to verify again? Is there a limit to how many ads I can post before craigslist gets suspicious of me again?
