What are the standard theories about what programming languages are adopted in a metropolitan startup ecosystem?

I have one such ecosystem in mind which is very conservative: mostly Java/PHP/.NET programmers are wanted, on the basis that you can get these people easily, which is not true for e.g. Ruby on Rails programmers.

Is it driven primarily by market forces or the higher education and programming training companies can influence this?

Any or all of the above can apply, depending on the company:

- Some businesses want cheap replaceable labor, and go with techs that have massive supply of programmers, like C, C++, Java, Javascript, or PHP.
- Other businesses only want top talent, and go with esoteric techs, like Lisp or oCamel.
- Businesses whose initial developer team was very familiar with one stack tend to end up picking that.
- Businesses can introduce a new tech at some point for a reason or another, and sometimes hire trainers to speed up their transition.
- Countless developers introduce a new language or framework or what have you to their company after learning it in their spare time.
- Solutions vendors have armies of sales people trying to introduce new techs in companies and bundle their solution with ample training.
