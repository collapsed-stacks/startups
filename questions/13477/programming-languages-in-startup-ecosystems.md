<p>What are the standard theories about what programming languages are adopted in a metropolitan startup ecosystem?</p>

<p>I have one such ecosystem in mind which is very conservative: mostly Java/PHP/.NET programmers are wanted, on the basis that you can get these people easily, which is not true for e.g. Ruby on Rails programmers.</p>

<p>Is it driven primarily by market forces or the higher education and programming training companies can influence this? </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Any or all of the above can apply, depending on the company:</p>

<ul>
<li>Some businesses want cheap replaceable labor, and go with techs that have massive supply of programmers, like C, C++, Java, Javascript, or PHP.</li>
<li>Other businesses only want top talent, and go with esoteric techs, like Lisp or oCamel.</li>
<li>Businesses whose initial developer team was very familiar with one stack tend to end up picking that.</li>
<li>Businesses can introduce a new tech at some point for a reason or another, and sometimes hire trainers to speed up their transition.</li>
<li>Countless developers introduce a new language or framework or what have you to their company after learning it in their spare time.</li>
<li>Solutions vendors have armies of sales people trying to introduce new techs in companies and bundle their solution with ample training.</li>
</ul>
