I am running an EdTech product where we will be selling Group Training sessions on various subjects. I and a couple of other guys have coded the entire product and since I am from a Technological background and lack of sales skills, I unable to find a way to get paying customers who could pay and join our online training session. Can anyone suggest me some methods how I can get my initial customers in this segment?

<p>I often start with guerilla marketing tactics, which they call "weapons". <a href="http://www.evancarmichael.com/Entrepreneur-Advice/446/100-Marketing-Weapons.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Here is a list of 100</a> that you can use. It's wise to use 10 or more of them simultaneously.  Some are simple, like having a name that describes your business, or asking early customers to refer other customers.</p>

<p>But to get your first customer(s), pick one of your training topics, then figure out where you'll find an ideal customer for that topic: they need to have an interest in the topic, they need to be the right age, they need to have enough free time, they need to have enough extra money to pay for the class, etc. Find out where they are (is it a mall? a school? a business? a bar?). Go there, or reach out to them at that place. Tell them you're offering this class, and give them some information on it. It always helps if you're solving a problem that they already have. Be prepared to provide printed information, and also be prepared to take the sale immediately too.  Use some of the "guerilla weapons" that you find on the list.</p>

<p>Another similar approach is to give the class for free to friends and relatives. Then, ask them to tell coworkers and other people about it and to direct those people to your website / app.</p>
