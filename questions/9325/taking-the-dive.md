Recently I read Dan Norris' book The [7 Day Startup][1] and have an idea for a SAAS business I would like to start. My current job is not working out and I have given notice and have been interviewing for jobs. I have a lot of debt, that's why I am still seeking employment. I have about two months savings before reality hits.

I had the idea 3 days ago and have been scrambling to get the website up while going to job interviews. I don't think it can be done in 7 days like Norris claims. First of all, there's a lot of coding to be done. It's not just bang out the Wordpress blog in 1 day, a lot of custom programming has to be done. Second of all, there's design. I have gone on Upwork (formerly oDesk) looking for graphic designers since design is not my forte and if I did the design myself, would take a couple of weeks at least.

My question really is should I devote 100% of my time to getting the MVP up as soon as possible instead of wasting time looking for work? So far I've gone on two second-round interviews, but they keep telling me they're swamped and will let me know. If I stopped looking for work and just concentrate on launching, I could be in for a rude awakening. In two months my savings would run out.

I started accepting freelance and part-time work. This should support me while I launch my SaaS startup. 

It occurred to me that the SaaS business I am trying to launch is the exact same kind of work I do for clients. I can now get paid for doing the same kind of work that my startup will be doing.
