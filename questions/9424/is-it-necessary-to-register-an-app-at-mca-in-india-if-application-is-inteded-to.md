I have made an android application which allows for buying or selling used books in the region of Pune, India. This application will be live for the next one month only.

I will be getting some money on each transaction. I do not understand if I should register it at MCA, India or not. Will there be any legal issues in this concern? Will there be any income tax issue?

<p>I suppose you mean, <a href="http://mca.gov.in/" rel="nofollow">Ministry of corporate affairs</a>. You register companies with MCA. Not applications.</p>

<p>I assume from your question that you are concerned that since you will be earning money, you will have to register with a government authority. It is not necessary. You can conduct business in India as an individual (called proprietorship). Since you will be doing this business only for a short period, you can do this in the proprietorship mode.</p>

<p>You need to register with Income Tax authorities and obtain PAN. You need to pay income tax on the monies received. If you are not aware of this, contact a chartered accountant.</p>
