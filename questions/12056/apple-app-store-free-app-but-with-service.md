## Apple App store - free app but with service

A long time ago I published an app on App store and got a million questions on my free app regarding how I make money on it. Now, I am here with a new app that has a subscription, but outside of App store. I just wanted to check that I do not run into any problems if the subscription is outside of app store - by problems I mean that I need to give money to Apple to publish my app.

To be clear, the app is free to download and install. But to use the cloud service I offer fully you need to sign up online.

Any insights appreciated!

<p>You should be fine. There are plenty of apps like Netflix and Spotify that use an outside subscription. The only limitation is if you offer a subscription within the app itself, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#in-app-purchase" rel="nofollow noreferrer">you must use Apple's in-app purchase mechanism</a>. </p>

<p>Spotify is an example of an app that allows you subscribe on their website or within the app, but the in-app subscription <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/7/8/8913105/spotify-apple-app-store-email" rel="nofollow noreferrer">costs more</a> because of Apple's cut.</p>
