<p>I have recently had the idea to start a small scale company, the idea is for self employed tradesmen to become employees of a shell company. the pay they receive from clients then goes firstly to the company (which is registered in a tax haven), and then paid into the tradesmens account at the end of the month.</p>

<p>This way their monthly pay can be more organised, with monthly payments rather than sporadic pay from their various clients. As the business is registered in a tax haven they will also receive the full amount of pay without tax. The business is profitable because it charges a small fee for the service.</p>

<p>I am looking to find out if it is legal to start this company ? Does the description look like tax avoidance (legal)?   </p>

<p>If anyone could provide me with links to more information on this I would be extremely grateful, thanks. </p>
