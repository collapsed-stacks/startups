I have recently had the idea to start a small scale company, the idea is for self employed tradesmen to become employees of a shell company. the pay they receive from clients then goes firstly to the company (which is registered in a tax haven), and then paid into the tradesmens account at the end of the month.

This way their monthly pay can be more organised, with monthly payments rather than sporadic pay from their various clients. As the business is registered in a tax haven they will also receive the full amount of pay without tax. The business is profitable because it charges a small fee for the service.

I am looking to find out if it is legal to start this company ? Does the description look like tax avoidance (legal)?   

If anyone could provide me with links to more information on this I would be extremely grateful, thanks.
