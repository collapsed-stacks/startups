I would like to know if there are any countries in Europe that do no have an electronic VAT(internet tax charged for services received in an EU country).

 I was thinking maybe it could be countries closer to Russia like <strike>Ukraine</strike><i>(Ukraine charges e-VAT)</i> or Turkey?

All countries in Europe charge VAT:

That's in theory anyway. Some special regions within the EU [charge no VAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_value_added_tax#Excluded_areas_within_the_EU). For instance the Canary Islands and Gibraltar.

EU states all collect it electronically. I'm not 100% about the non-EU ones, but I'd be surprised if they don't as well.
