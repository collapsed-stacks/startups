<p>I would like to know if there are any countries in Europe that do no have an electronic VAT(internet tax charged for services received in an EU country).</p>

<p>I was thinking maybe it could be countries closer to Russia like <strike>Ukraine</strike><i>(Ukraine charges e-VAT)</i> or Turkey?</p>

<p>All countries in Europe charge VAT:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_rates_of_Europe" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_rates_of_Europe</a></p>

<p>That's in theory anyway. Some special regions within the EU <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_value_added_tax#Excluded_areas_within_the_EU" rel="nofollow">charge no VAT</a>. For instance the Canary Islands and Gibraltar.</p>

<p>EU states all collect it electronically. I'm not 100% about the non-EU ones, but I'd be surprised if they don't as well.</p>
