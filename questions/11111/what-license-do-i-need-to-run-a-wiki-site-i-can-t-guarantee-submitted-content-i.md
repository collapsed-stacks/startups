I'm starting a knowledge base where I want content (text and images) to be freely submitted and edited without requiring registration from my users, so they collectively can build an index in this particular subject.

 - What licenses do I need to make sure that I'm not responsible for
   copyright being violated?
 - I'm not selling anything on the site, I just provide the system on which they share content. I might have to implement ads/donations to keep the eventual server costs down, but I'll cross that bridge when I come to it

I've searched far and wide but I just don't understand what I should be looking for.

<p>Take a look at what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyrights" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a> did for handling this exact issue in terms of licensing the content as well as specifically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyrights#Contributors.27_rights_and_obligations" rel="nofollow">contributor's rights and obligations</a>. Wikipedia requires users who submit content to confirm their compliance with these policies for any edits to their pages before accepting their changes: it's hard-wired into the edit-preview-submit workflow.</p>

<p>On a separate note, you can also use the software behind Wikipedia if you like their work flow; it's called <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/" rel="nofollow">MediaWiki</a> and it's open source (not to be confused with <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/" rel="nofollow">WikiMedia Foundation</a>, the organization behind Wikipedia and MediaWiki).</p>
