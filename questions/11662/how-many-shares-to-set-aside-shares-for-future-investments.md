<p>We have a US company with 10,000,000 shares. How many should be issued at the start? Our lawyers (from abroad) are recommending 100,000 shares, but the accelerator we're in think 7,000,000 is a far more reasonable number.</p>

<p>What are the pros and cons of each?</p>

<p>If we only reserve 30% for future investments, then we may need to issue more shares in the near to distant future. Is there a downside to only issuing 1% of the shares? Would it make future investors feel uncomfortable?</p>
