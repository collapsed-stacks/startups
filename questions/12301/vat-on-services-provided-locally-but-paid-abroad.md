<p>let's say I've a company in Iceland, it's a website. On this website, clients from all over the world can pay for different services (no shipped products) like a diner in a restaurant, a ride in a car or parachute jumping... but these services are not provided in Iceland (99% for them at least).</p>

<p>My website sells the service to the client, sends the bill, but an independent worker provides the service I sold (and the service would have the name of my company). So he's not an employee and I don't have any address in the country where the service is provided.</p>

<p>How does it work for VAT ? Should I add the VAT of the country where the service is provided ? Does it mean I have to contact all the administrations... ? It's going to be crazy.</p>

<p>Or because the website/company is registered in Iceland, I've to charge the VAT of Iceland to all the clients for all the services ?</p>
