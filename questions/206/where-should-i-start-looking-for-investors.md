I'm starting a software-based startup with a small team (outside of USA). Initially it will be a mobile app (Android & iOS) along with a web interface, which will later be expanded into other platforms. It's hard to gain traction without proper marketing and also processes like hosting, and other paid services required by the application we're developing needs a somewhat large amount of money. I'm interested in establishing my products internationally (main target audience is USA). 

So we need to find someone (or a company) to invest in our startup. How and where should I start? Are there any places (websites, summits, etc) I should be visiting? Some tips to "woo-in" potential investors are also appreciated.

<p>If you are really starting from scratch (I'm talking about your <em>business</em> not your <em>product</em>), to me the best way to gain attention is to participate in <strong>startup competitions</strong>, pitch contests etc. I do not know where you come from but there has to be some of these competitions around you. To my mind participating in these is the key: it shows will, it teaches you a lot and investors do know that; it's a perfect way for them to meet you and <em>vice versa</em></p>

<p>Of course if you have <strong>relatives</strong> with connections it would be a good start also, at least to ask for advice (if not for millions!).</p>

<p>You can look into <a href="http://www.seedstarsworld.com/">Seedstarsworld</a> (for developping countries), <a href="http://www.founder.org/home/">Founder.org</a> (annually pitch contest), <a href="http://www.hello-tomorrow.org/">Hello Tomorrow Challenge</a> (european), <a href="http://startupweekend.org/">Startup Weekends</a> (be careful, you may be only allowed to join with your idea, not your product; however it's a unique way to gather opinions) and there are hundreds of these.</p>

<p>Finally if you feel like devoting your time to your project, look for <strong>incubators/accelerators</strong>! Their very aim is to guide you, on both your product and your business.</p>
