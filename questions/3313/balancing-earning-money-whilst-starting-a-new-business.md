<p>I am currently a director of an adventure tour company in Georgia (georidersmtb.com) that operates through the summer season. In the winter it currently is low season, so I find other work e.g. I got a job as a contract web developer as its one of my skillsets.</p>

<p>However, increasingly I'm feeling like doing the web stuff in order to keep myself buoyant is having a negative effect - e.g. by using it as a fallback, its neither my full focus or off the table. I've got a conflict between starting a new business I'm passionate about and something that I can do well, I'm passionate about but would never want to do full time and which given the choice, I would probably try to keep only as a hobby. </p>

<p>This might sound ungrateful that I've a skill I can use and also apply to my business. When it comes to other ways to earn serious money on a part-time basis, I find it difficult to find anything else that compares, and I'm worried that it is a limit in my own awareness as opposed to there not being anything out there. I can ramp up the business as much as I can but its still going to be seasonal.</p>
