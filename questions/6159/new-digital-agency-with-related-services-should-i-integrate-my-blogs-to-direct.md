<p>I've got two blogs one about coding and another about design methods. I'm setting up a digital agency and I want to have a blog on it which contains this content to offer it as a resource but also to attract potential clients. </p>

<p>The design methods blog has more of an tailored UI that the coding blog which is a standard template. </p>

<p>Do you think it is worth trying to combine them or should I keep two blogs or is there another way of handling this?</p>

<p>The links are www.codebloc.co.uk and www.designmethodsandprocesses.co.uk The agency site isn't up yet.</p>

<p>You could leave them separate, this way you'd have 2 places where people can find you. But this would complicate your marketing efforts and also your image in the future. You're clients might not get the full picture about you if they read only one blog.</p>

<p>If you decide to put them under one blog, what you could do is make readers understand that the posts are written by different people, by displaying the picture and the name of the writer, just like many other startups do.</p>
