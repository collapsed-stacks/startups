One of my favorite quotes is: "the best way to kill an entrepreneur is to give them a comfortable job"

It's never too late (or early) to venture off on your first entrepreneurial business.

In fact, because you do freelance and don't have a family to provide for yet, I think the transition would be easier. you could ease into it by reducing your freelance time and work your business idea more.

It's usually more difficult for those people who have a comfortable job and a family to provide for so the risk of jumping over to a startup is much harder.

Best of luck to you and keep asking us great questions!

Business is about sales. Before you get to the stage of selling a product, you will have to sell your ability to generate sales in the future to potential investors. Your age is a very insignificant part of the equation, as long as it is between 20 and about 45.

It's never too late to start a business. If anything you're at a prime age to do so.

That said, I disagree with the idea that a founder's age is insignificant and that it's harder to found a company after 45. If anything, agism is so rampant in some industries that you're basically forced into freelancing, running a business, or changing career. Plus, founders in their 40s or later are, as a group, successful more often than those in their 20s -- because lessons learned and a rolodex helps them take more shortcuts and avoid tons of mistakes, and they can fund their own business themselves.

Most people associate a problems of age with starting a business because of other financial and family ties. You've said that you're a bachelor and looking after your parents so I'd suppose the real question is not are you too old but can you afford it? No one is ever "Too Old" its about weighing up the risks of doing it against your personal financial/family commitments.

Personally I say if you're confident you can make it profitable then go for it!

Age never stops someone to start and run a business. What you really need to focus on is "Idea" and how you can convert it in sales and hence profit. I personally am a part of more than 150 small and micro businesses and the first thing I think of today after a lot of failures is if something I want to sell is worth buying. I do some pre-business surveys like go and ask the people I think could be my potential clients if they would be interested to buy the services or product I would be offering at the given price tag. And if not what would they expect from a business like this. Learn about the competition. Understand your personal finances and how much you are willing to contribute towards your business. Understand the Legal, Tax and other obligations. Get the data, brainstorm over the data, and be realistic. Only after a strong YES invest your money, time and effort.

Though I would love to see each and every person become an entrepreneur and build their businesses, I also know 90% of the business fail during the first few years it starts. And some of them start with great ideas but they cannot attract enough attention and sales. Sometimes the ideas and products are too ahead of its time and the business owners can't simply don't have patience or resources and they give up.

So yes its not the age, its ideas, sales and a lot of perseverance.
