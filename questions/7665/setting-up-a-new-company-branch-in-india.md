<p>I am trying a start a new company in the USA. But I would need support from folks based out in India. I was thinking of setting up a branch office, but it looks like there is a requirement of some income/profit in the parent company to be eligible. Since this is a company that wouldn't be profitable yet as we are yet to start. how should i setup the company. The development work will start immediately. </p>

<p>Can I have someone set up a company in India and I can provide work and payments by treating it as another Client and pay for its services? <br />
OR<br /> 
Branch office is the only way to go?</p>

<p>Please advise. This is a new venture that I am going into and still learning all the rules.</p>
