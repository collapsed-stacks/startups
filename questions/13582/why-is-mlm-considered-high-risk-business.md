<p>Checking with PayPal and other credit cards gateways, there are some restrictions about using them with "high risk" businesses. Those include gambling, porn and a few others. But what I can't understand is why they consider Multi Level Marketing / Network Marketing high risk.</p>

<p>MLMs are illegal in some jurisdictions, and in places where they're not, illegal pyramid schemes often present themselves as MLMs. It tends to be a business model with an overrrepresentation of less-than-reputable actors, making it a high risk sector.</p>

<p>Because they rely on new marketers rewarding previous ones. Its like a Ponzi scheme. They need constant flow of ever increasing newcomers to function. So MLM marketing need momentum to work, and can seldom sustain that for long.</p>
