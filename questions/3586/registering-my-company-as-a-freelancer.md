I am planning to register my company in Canada where I am the owner and self employed so I can open a bank account just for my company.

Where do I have to go and what do I have to do in order to receive a business registration number?

<p>You can do it via their <a href="http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/bsnss/tpcs/bn-ne/bro-ide/rstrctns/menu-eng.html">Business Registration Online</a> page. There's quite a lot to read but it's also quite important!</p>

<p>I've recently done the same thing in the UK, the forms look very different but they are very similar in terms of requirements. </p>

<p>Oh, also check out <a href="http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/cntct/menu-eng.html">their FAQ page</a>. Chances are that any question you have has already been asked by someone else :)</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>
