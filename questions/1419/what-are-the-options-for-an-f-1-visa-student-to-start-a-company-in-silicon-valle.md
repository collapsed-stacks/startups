Generally, on F-1 you cannot be employed, and that includes being self-employed. You can do something with advancing your OPT to the period while you're still studying, but you still have to be enrolled for full time studies, and that comes on the account of the OPT after graduation.

Once you finish your studies, you can be self employed under certain conditions as part of OPT. Once your OPT is over, you need to either switch to a different status that would allow continuing being self-employed (either green card, or become dependent of a J1/L1 holder), or move out.

If your company becomes large enough to allow sponsoring your H1b while you're on OPT - that would be awesome. Chances are very slim though.
