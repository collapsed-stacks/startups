<p>I have an app that I am developing into a minimum viable product. The app requires input (data/info) from companies. How do I go about introducing/pitch my app to those companies, who do I contact or approach about setting up a possible meeting to introduce the app and the potential benefits said company can get.</p>

<p>As you have already said, you are preparing MVP. MVP is a great start to display the vision of the company. </p>

<p>As Jithin said, you would require all of that pointers. But in addition you will require a proper market research and analysis. Which means numbers. </p>

<p>Business man like numbers, and honestly they only understand numbers. So you might want to do some market research before approaching the companies. </p>

<p>Market research could talking to the end-users and getting their feedbacks on your MVP. I understand that the company can give you that too but getting from end-users is something very important. And this will prepare you for the presentation too.</p>

<p>Remember that, once you are out i.e your idea is out you will start having competitors and substitutes so might want to play a safe game until u get to the company.</p>
