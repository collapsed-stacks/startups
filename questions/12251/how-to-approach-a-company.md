I have an app that I am developing into a minimum viable product. The app requires input (data/info) from companies. How do I go about introducing/pitch my app to those companies, who do I contact or approach about setting up a possible meeting to introduce the app and the potential benefits said company can get.

 1. The plain introduction of your product with no intention of making them buy in their perspective.
 2. Collect details regarding their company that relates with your product considering even minute connections with your product.
 3. Analyse the requirements collected with your structure/products.
 4. Prepare report from the obtained data showing how your product can optimise and improve the productivity of the company.
 5. Fix a meeting and present this before them.

*PS: Always remember to keep a door open for feedbacks.*

As you have already said, you are preparing MVP. MVP is a great start to display the vision of the company. 

As Jithin said, you would require all of that pointers. But in addition you will require a proper market research and analysis. Which means numbers. 

Business man like numbers, and honestly they only understand numbers. So you might want to do some market research before approaching the companies. 

Market research could talking to the end-users and getting their feedbacks on your MVP. I understand that the company can give you that too but getting from end-users is something very important. And this will prepare you for the presentation too.

Remember that, once you are out i.e your idea is out you will start having competitors and substitutes so might want to play a safe game until u get to the company.
