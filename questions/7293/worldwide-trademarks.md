<p>I don't know if this is the right place to ask about this or not, anyway,
we are establishing a startup and I want to know how to register our company logo as a trademark to not allow any company to use our logo anywhere, anytime, for example, no one can use the Coca cola logo without their permission, so how to do that ?</p>

<p>You are going to need to visit the National Trademark Association. Here is the link to their website <a href="http://www.inta.org/TrademarkBasics/FactSheets/Pages/TrademarkFees(Global)FactSheet.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.inta.org/TrademarkBasics/FactSheets/Pages/TrademarkFees(Global)FactSheet.aspx</a>, more specifically an article on their website that gives information for the worldwide trademarks, fees, considerations, etc. This is going to be quite costly as this is a worldwide trademark rather than just a country wide trademark. But if you read this you will get an idea of how much it will be and how to go about registering for it. </p>
