<p>My c-corp is moving out of state and is registering as a foreign entity in SC. In MA I need to update the company's office and shareholder's address to the new location. </p>

<p>Is the "Articles of Amendment" the right form to file (costs $100) or is there another form that should be used for this or can I just email corpinfo@sec.state.ma.us &amp; give them the new address?</p>

<p>The correct form is the "<strong>Statement of Change of Supplemental Information</strong>", which is no fee.</p>
