My c-corp is moving out of state and is registering as a foreign entity in SC. In MA I need to update the company's office and shareholder's address to the new location. 

Is the "Articles of Amendment" the right form to file (costs $100) or is there another form that should be used for this or can I just email corpinfo@sec.state.ma.us & give them the new address?

The correct form is the "**Statement of Change of Supplemental Information**", which is no fee.
