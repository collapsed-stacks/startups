Is there any publicly listed figures for app downloads by category and region? and if not; how would I go about estimating the size and get a verifiable figure? 

What I am planning to do is get the total number of downloaded apps in the entertainment category, list down a few similar or competing apps and check out their share of downloads. that would be a very rough estimate, is this acceptable ?
