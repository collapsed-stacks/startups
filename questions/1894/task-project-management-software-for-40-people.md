I have a 40 member team working on diverse projects. Right now, it has become very difficult to manage each one of them and get maximum productivity out of them.

Need a task and project management software for 40+ members where we can allot targets and tasks to each person as well have group deadlines.

**More Info**
I want a low cost option as I dont have a very high budget. Also something which people find easy to use as a lot of staff are creative people who won't understand complex UI.

Which programs can you recommend for this purpose?


Thanks!

<p>The product you're looking for depends on budget, whether you're working within a life cycle, if you're working in Agile (and sprints) with Scrum or Kanban, or are you using Waterfall? etc.</p>

<p>For simple tasklists, some clients I've worked with have used <a href="https://trello.com/" rel="nofollow">Trello</a> to kick-start projects, assign work and keep track of deliverables. I've never seen it be used for 40+ people though so it might not suit your needs.</p>

<p>If you've got a bit of budget and are able to buy licences, something like <a href="http://www.targetprocess.com/" rel="nofollow">TargetProcess</a> (an SDLC tool) or HP's Quality Centre would be useful. I'd recommend doing some research into a number of SDLC tools because there are so many variables that will define what you use. </p>

<p>However, there won't be an easy solution to this. Asking 40+ people to use software that you're implementing into an existing work environment will take some serious time!</p>

<p>Hope this helps a little bit. If you could edit your question to be a bit more specific, you might get a better or more useful/relevant answer.</p>

<p>As someone already suggested, it depends a lot on the process you follow. <a href="http://www.bugzilla.org" rel="nofollow">Bugzilla</a> is a free one and is easily configurable to suite many purposes. I've seen it working as a bug tracker, task tracker, hiring tracker etc. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira" rel="nofollow">JIRA</a> is another tool that is available as a saas offering and is easily configurable to suite most of the project tracking processes/needs. If you are looking specifically for scrum/kanban model, Jira would suite. I've heard good things about <a href="https://www.rallydev.com" rel="nofollow">rally</a> as well for scrum/kanban models, might be a bit pricey though.</p>

<p>Here is a link to some of the <a href="http://blog.capterra.com/free-open-source-project-management-software/" rel="nofollow">Free and Open Source Project Management Software</a></p>
