I am personally a business minded person. My skills are: software product development, content writing (not highly qualified for every kind of content, but very good for the products that I have), taking it abroad, business communications, customer development and business systematization. </br> Think of it like this: if a startup takes only 2 co-founders, a technical and a business person, I usually sign up for the latter. Business man. I've been reading and practicing about this for at least 6 years and I have previous experience too. </br>

I want a savvy web developer that can build different website extensions/features and shape the finished product for me. I have samples, I can provide even more explanations, I am confident it will generate great income because a lot of market research has been done for it. </br>

So, my main question is how can I find a **savvy web developer** to co-found it with me? Please keep in mind that i will not be paying salary for him, we share the business together and the income will be divided 50/50 between us.
