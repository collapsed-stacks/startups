<p>What is the most easy way to rent out designer clothes and make sure people bring them back? So people don't just rent a Versace dress for 50 euro and keep it. Options I have been thinking of is deposit (but the idea is to make design clothing available for people who cannot buy it, so don't think this is a good option), blocking amount on credit card (but I think that will scare people away and is too drastic) or working with billing...</p>

<p>Go to a few wedding dress and wedding costume stores in your area and ask them how they do it. Wedding attire is admittedly a bit special in that you'd only rent them <em>once</em> but they likely have a thing or two to tell you about how renting expensive cloths is done in your area.</p>

<p>FWIW, in my own area it involved a combination of an ID and a deposit that they'd return upon reception of the (undamaged) attire. (They'd take care of the dry cleaning.)</p>

<p>Aside: It's tempting to try to overprotect oneself against edge cases by putting all sorts of checks and barriers in place - much like they do to, say, spot abuses in government help programs. But the truth is that, in general, people <em>are</em> civic and honest. Expect most of them to actually do their best to return whatever they rented in good conditions and in a timely manner. There <em>will</em> be exceptions, of course. Plan for them somewhat so they're not too much of a burden when they occur. But don't obsess about preventing them to the point where it becomes a burden to your own business.</p>
