I am an owner of a registered LLC, however, I am assuming I can't just say that everything I do is a business related activity and falls under it's limited liability legal rights... There must be a "legitimate" way to associate my LLC to my website?

If there's a paper trail showing the company pays for the domain and is listed in the whois record as the owner, that's it; meaning I'm sure you could do a number of other things, but those are the basics.

For example, if another party "owned" the domain and "gave" it to the company, likely be a good idea to have a formal transfer agreement between the parties.
