I am having the following scenario. I'm getting ready to submit application for the startup accelerator program. Before that I need to build a team for the project (at least for the prototype). I think for this stage one person is enough. I am software engineer and he/she will be too.

My question is what should I take into consideration while selecting peer?
1st and must: She/he is a developer.
Next, should(is it better?) they be friends? Should I know them before? Should they be as motivated and fascinated with the idea as I am?

You're looking for co-founders.

You need to have a top-gun with you.

Someone that :

A- Is smart

B- Can get things done

C- Will watch your back and stay with you no matter what

Being as motivated as you are would be a real plus, but as a CEO, you'll have to motivate them somehow.

It is much better if you have already worked with them and know you'll get along well.

Friends and/or family is perfectly acceptable and very common.

One of the main things you should look at when finding a co-founder is commitment. 

No matter how capable and enthusiastic he/she is, it means nothing with no follow through. Look for someone who is willing to sacrifice time for the project as much as you are. 

Developing your startup will be a learning process; someone who is passionate about learning would be a great co-founder. 

Finally, find someone who is positive and not afraid to fail. When problems arise, you want a partner that will actively try to motivate your team and get them through the process. 

Best of luck!

You said that one person is enough for the app development in this stage so do not rule out all other non pure software developers just because they cannot independently make an app.

You could consider trying to partner with someone that has a skill set different from yours which will complement you and help bring in a diversity of ideas.  It's always helpful having someone with legal/finance/marketing/content writing experience so they can work on other parts of the business while you make the app.  If you find someone that can be a business analyst role and assist with some of the programming, but handle the other roles, then your team may be more productive overall.

Even when you work with an accelerator, you will need to sign many legal documents and provide them with equity in your company.  If you have someone with legal and finance experience, they can save you a lot of time and perhaps help negotiate the best deal for your company.
