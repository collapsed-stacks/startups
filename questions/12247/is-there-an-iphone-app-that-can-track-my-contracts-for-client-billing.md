I hope this is welcome here. I know business owners is in area51 right now, but I digress. I'd like to know if there is an iPhone App that anyone here has come across that would allow me to keep track of my various independent contractors, business services, etc. that I catalogue and rely on to bring a project to fruition under my guidance, where I ultimately can then determine how to bill the client. It would be great to just get a bill for a service/good from a partner and just take a picture of the invoice and just type in the business name (or whatever it is), the cost, etc. and have a running catalogue of the costs for any one project for multiple projects (clients). Is there anything like this? Because hardcopies and folders and calling secretaries to relay that to me isn't as good as having it in my hands with a clear ?real-time? running total of expenses. Anyway, I apologize in advance if this isn't welcome here, and if it isn't please delete. Best.

Coincidentally, three years ago I began work on just such an app. I quit to pursue other ventures, but luckily another company took on the challenge.  There's a product called Wave. It does invoicing, payments, payroll, accounting and lending.  It also has a "Receipts" module, allowing users to take a picture of a receipt and include it in an invoice. Or just file it away for a rainy day, so no more lost receipts.

Seems like exactly what you're looking for.  And in case anyone's wondering, I have no affiliation with Wave. It just looks like it a good product to me.
