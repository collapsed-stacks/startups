Startup is for IoT product for home and commercial market.
Amazing potential.  

I need to tell CEO what I want:

1. Stock options:  Is it reasonable to ask for fixed % of company value?  How do I phrase this?  What schedule of vesting is reasonable?
2. annual salary:  I have a Min. figure I'm satisfied with.  CEO suggested it.

3. Bonus?

anything else?


My background:
I have 35 years software management, architecture, coding, and recent machine learning and sensor-algorithm-fusion.  Presently consulting
