<p>Startup is for IoT product for home and commercial market.
Amazing potential.  </p>

<p>I need to tell CEO what I want:</p>

<ol>
<li>Stock options:  Is it reasonable to ask for fixed % of company value?  How do I phrase this?  What schedule of vesting is reasonable?</li>
<li><p>annual salary:  I have a Min. figure I'm satisfied with.  CEO suggested it.</p></li>
<li><p>Bonus?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>anything else?</p>

<p>My background:
I have 35 years software management, architecture, coding, and recent machine learning and sensor-algorithm-fusion.  Presently consulting</p>
