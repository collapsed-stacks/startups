<p>I have a very good idea and want to start my own business. But I'm not engineer guy( my major is business, I got MBA degree). Now I am looking for a software developer who has experience at least 5 years as co-founder to start a new business. How can I find him or her?</p>

<p>The question is good, but very hard to answer. Here's my attempt:</p>

<p>I would lean towards <strong>looking for developers in your local area</strong>. Why local? Because when your partner should be a co-founder, you really need to work face-to-face since there are so many decisions you as business owners have to make over time.</p>

<p>So the question is <strong>where to find local developers?</strong>
The answer is pretty simply: everywhere they tend to hang out together. For example</p>

<ul>
<li>Technical meetups</li>
<li>Meetups related to startups</li>
<li>Hackatons</li>
<li>Co-working spaces</li>
<li>Local Software Development conferences</li>
</ul>

<p>And if you've found those places the next question is how you can convince a developer to become part of your startup? At least you should give a thought on not hiring a CTO as a co-founder but just outsource development. Maybe you can find an experienced developer as a <em>CTO-for-rent</em> that takes a look at the development on demand.</p>
