I have a very good idea and want to start my own business. But I'm not engineer guy( my major is business, I got MBA degree). Now I am looking for a software developer who has experience at least 5 years as co-founder to start a new business. How can I find him or her?

The question is good, but very hard to answer. Here's my attempt:

I would lean towards **looking for developers in your local area**. Why local? Because when your partner should be a co-founder, you really need to work face-to-face since there are so many decisions you as business owners have to make over time.

So the question is **where to find local developers?**
The answer is pretty simply: everywhere they tend to hang out together. For example

- Technical meetups
- Meetups related to startups
- Hackatons
- Co-working spaces
- Local Software Development conferences

And if you've found those places the next question is how you can convince a developer to become part of your startup? At least you should give a thought on not hiring a CTO as a co-founder but just outsource development. Maybe you can find an experienced developer as a *CTO-for-rent* that takes a look at the development on demand.

Along with angle.co, as mentioned earlier, you can also check out:
