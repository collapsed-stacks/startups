The main question is about a CRM software, but in fact it could be about anything that is well established in terms of business software.

Most people thinks that you have to have a unique idea to success, but as i'm reading more and more about startups i see that it could be difficult and expensive to promote certain service if nobody knows such a service exists (or even could exist).

If it's true, then it should be also true, that in fact (potential) chances for success are equal - or even greater - when you do something that is not unique at all. Am i right?

Anyway, my main question should be seen as a: Is it a good idea for a startup to create a well established "thing" but different, dedicated for some niche, and does it sounds like an startup idea with a reasonable chances for success?

How you define success and startup are really the core issues within your question. I personally do not define a startup as a new business, but as a type of new business. Most new businesses are not startups, but as you say, a copy of an existing business. These businesses rarely, if ever, produce the growth that "true" startups in theory have the potential to produce; clearly, not all startups grow to become massive companies, in fact, most fail.

If you define success as simply returning a profit, then yes, you will have much less risk copying an existing business, but also have much less chance of experiencing massive growth.

Most people don't start startups for money, because if they are their likely in the wrong field.

What might be confusing you is that people don't buy services, features, or processes; they buy answers, benefits, and solutions. For instance, you don't go to the dentist to get white teeth; you go there to get a charming bright smile.

The moment you understand that, promoting a service becomes easier and cheaper: it's about finding the people who benefit from what you're solving and want to pay for this benefit, and then convincing them you'll deliver. It matters little if your product or service is new or something they're familiar with.

Still, you're correct when assessing that it's easier to introduce something that isn't entirely unique: lots of competition usually means there's lots of demand. More often than not, it also leaves a lot of wiggle room for new entrants to differentiate and conquer narrow niche markets.

As such, yes: it's easier, and don't let naysayers convince you of the contrary. Especially in the CRM market, where new entrants show up all the time.
