<p>After a 3 month android crash course, scouring the internet and intense research on the Stack Exchange Network I was successful in creating a working application, GUI, as well as some background number tracking (array outputs).  For my intent and purposes the application is fully functional, not ugly, and has proven precisely what I set out to find out.</p>

<p>I would like to put it into the wild but know it needs a few things added.</p>

<p>Crash protection encapsulation.</p>

<p>Persistent memory when app is in the background.</p>

<p>Implement Google Play requirements.</p>

<p>Anything else  missed that may inhibit a good user experience.
Code review, remove any redundant code, simplification of classes where needed.
(The current code is small. Not hard to review.)</p>

<p>At minimum get out of beta and Google ready which could be as soon as the first 3 requirements are met. </p>

<p>Being a self funded startup I have been researching alternative payment options such as equity and other company founder benefits. I initially intended on offering full partnership for the developer that could do this and stay on for a few years as bug control (vested preferred stock structure and such).</p>

<p>However if such a programmer cannot stay on, at the very least we need someone to take care of the listed tasks. 
I'm looking for a time and cost quote for the enhancements to my Android application in order to know what to offer the "one shot" Developer (in shares) that would be reasonable to both parties.  </p>

<p>This would also give us a starting point for a crowd sourced fundraiser or stock sales for raising funds to hire a developer.</p>

<p>I know there are quite a few freelance sites I could join and post a job scope, but that may be misleading since my intent only to get a few price &amp; time quotes without the actual intent to hire immediately.  I have also considered our local university to see if there are any students interested in this project but still need a starting price point. I like the idea of hiring local. </p>

<p><strong><em>I am not familiar with protocols regarding quote gathering on freelance programming sites.
I am concerned about repercussions for listing the job, receiving offers, but not completing the listing by hiring a candidate.</em></strong></p>

<p>Realizing that each site has its own specializations and target markets:</p>

<p>What sites are open to these types of inquiries and will be receptive to our needs as listed? (There are so many! <a href="http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/50-freelance-job-sites-for-designers-programmers-best-of/" rel="nofollow">http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/50-freelance-job-sites-for-designers-programmers-best-of/</a>)</p>

<p>Should our intent be listed in the job scope or should we just list as if we intend on hiring immediately?</p>

<p>Would it be appropriate to list on careers.stackoverflow.com?</p>

<p>Should we communicate directly with users of sites such as upwork.com or just list a job and see what offers come in.</p>

<p>I would enjoy any constructive advice regarding this scenario that may not have been already listed on the Stack Exchange Network.</p>

<p>I believe you have 2 questions here.</p>

<p>First question is where to find a talent especially if you're tight on budget.</p>

<p>My answer would be to look for an offshore development company. And of course here I would promote mine in the first place. So if you're interested I'd be happy to discuss it in greater detail. Our site is: <a href="http://www.varteq.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.varteq.com</a>. My opinion is not the one to be trusted as I have a conflict of interest here, but I really do believe this is the way to go.</p>

<p>The second question is whether anyone is interested in taking an equity instead of cash.</p>

<p>It's possible, but this means you're looking for an investor. Sweat equity is an investment just like your hard earned cash. This means you have to pitch your startup just like you would if you were asking for funding. If the startup looks promising you might be able to find someone. No one can tell for sure before you get your idea out.</p>
