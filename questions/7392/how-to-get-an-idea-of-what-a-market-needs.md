Is there a website where people discuss what type of technology software they want to see developed and released?  I want to satisfy a market need. I have limited resources. Is there still no good tool to archive OpenStack nova resources? The database table keeps growing as nova nodes are created and deleted.  

It seems like Jenkins, the first Apple computer, and nmap were created by one person. Is there a modest plugin for Jenkins or Hadoop that I could write? I want to try to tackle something that one person could handle and see where the product takes me (e.g. an open source contribution that could lead to consulting or a business wrapped around the proprietary product).

First of all, when you're asking yourself **what a market needs before writing code** you're absolutely on the right track.

> Is there a website were people discuss what type of technology software they want to see developed and released?

No, I'm not aware of such a website without any restriction in terms of technology or market. In my opinion a better way would be to visit online communities associated to a specific target market or technology.

**Where to start?** One way would be to start where you already have technical and / or market expertise.

> Is there a modest plugin for Jenkins or Hadoop that I could write?

E.g. for Jenkins and Hadoop, go and look where users of those technologies meet online such as 

- user groups
- forums
- StackOverflow or other StackExchange sites

A good way to find out current problems in specific technology is also to browse through bug trackers. 
For example see this [Jira Bug Report](https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-28748) - it was not possible to migrate Jira Agile projects between instances for years. In the meantime it has been solved, but companies would have paid good money for a third-party solution.

- Rob Walling - serial founder of self-funded startups like [Drip](http://getdrip.com) - has wrote a [book](http://www.startupbook.net/) in which he describes how to come up with ideas serving a specific market niche. He suggests to start with your **_warm niches_** - niches in which you or your family, friends or acquaintances have domain knowledge in.
