<p>Is there a website where people discuss what type of technology software they want to see developed and released?  I want to satisfy a market need. I have limited resources. Is there still no good tool to archive OpenStack nova resources? The database table keeps growing as nova nodes are created and deleted.  </p>

<p>It seems like Jenkins, the first Apple computer, and nmap were created by one person. Is there a modest plugin for Jenkins or Hadoop that I could write? I want to try to tackle something that one person could handle and see where the product takes me (e.g. an open source contribution that could lead to consulting or a business wrapped around the proprietary product).</p>

<p>First of all, when you're asking yourself <strong>what a market needs before writing code</strong> you're absolutely on the right track.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>No, I'm not aware of such a website without any restriction in terms of technology or market. In my opinion a better way would be to visit online communities associated to a specific target market or technology.</p>

<p><strong>Where to start?</strong> One way would be to start where you already have technical and / or market expertise.</p>

<p>E.g. for Jenkins and Hadoop, go and look where users of those technologies meet online such as </p>

<ul>
<li>user groups</li>
<li>forums</li>
<li>StackOverflow or other StackExchange sites</li>
</ul>

<p>A good way to find out current problems in specific technology is also to browse through bug trackers. 
For example see this <a href="https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-28748" rel="nofollow">Jira Bug Report</a> - it was not possible to migrate Jira Agile projects between instances for years. In the meantime it has been solved, but companies would have paid good money for a third-party solution.</p>
