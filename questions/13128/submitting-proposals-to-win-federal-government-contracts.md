<p>If a small tech startup has obtained 8(a) certification and is submitting proposals for federal government contracts, but <strong>fails</strong> to initiate marketing efforts aimed at decision makers at agencies or primes, and instead solely relies on churning out proposal after proposal as the means of trying to win a federal contract:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>What are the chances of success when submitting proposals <strong>after</strong> an
    opportunity is listed on fbo.gov?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the chances of success when submitting proposals <strong>prior</strong> to an opportunity being listed on fbo.gov, as found on a paid
    resource such as GovWin or EZGovOpps?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Are there companies that try this strategy and succeed? If they do succeed, are they the exception to the rule rather than the norm?</p>

<p>If you really want to go the government grant route. I suggest that you look for partnership with a university that has experience with obtaining grants. Find a researcher interested in the same or similar area as your "small tech".</p>

<p>Good Luck.</p>

<p>Most of the government projects, would have a criteria that they should have experience dealing with any of government projects. This is the place where a new company would fail to get the contract.
My suggestion would be to tie up with an existing vendor and perform some government projects and later mention those experience while applying for new proposals.</p>
