I've incorporated a business in the US that'll provide software services. Currently, I am the only employee and I am using it as a way of providing consulting services to a client.

I plan on scaling the company in the next few years and would like to use the company website to attract new clients. I understand that writing a blog is one way of doing it. I can write articles/tips on various technologies and topics but should I be doing it on a company site (blog.mycompany.com)? Or should I do it on a personal website? 

I'd rather not use my name as I don't want it to be associated with the company while I work for my employer. Does it really matter if I blog under a generic company username?

It depends if you want your company to be gaining reputation or is it yourself that needs to gain reputation. I suspect it is the former, and as you cant write under your own name, that points that you should be writing blogs within your company site. I think that the larger the body of knowledge you display within your domain URL, the better off you are.

Blogs (text, youtube, etc.) are largely for the **same set of purposes**

 - to establish thought leadership in the  minds of your readers
 - to build an online presence
 - to enhance your natural and paid search position
 - to attract prospects and build custom

Then the question of anonymous blogs depends on they type of company you plan to be. If you are planning to be a niche player with a smaller number of high level consultants, then I think the names of individuals are important who write blogs, as then your clients can get to know them and engage with them over time. Individuals can demonstrate over time particular specialties. If you are planning to have a large number of clients with a large number of fairly faceless staff, then individual names are perhaps less important.

We are very much in the first category, a data analytics company with 12 staff all of whom write blogs in their own niche areas and own style - particular computer languages, analytics, business application, etc. For us this works well.

I would suggest that you could publish initially under a generic company username, then when you decide to hoist your colours, then re-publish the blogs under your own name.

I too had the same question and I thought that making videos for youtube is much better. It always depends on how much time you have or your editing skills, but IMHO it's more likely to gather a rather bigger group of customers that would watch videos on youtube than visit some blog they won't even save in bookmarks.

Good luck

Well, in my Opinion it's better to start writing on the behalf of your company which you are trying to establish as long as your current employer doesn't have any problem with it. This will not only help you to promote your company/business but also drive traffic to your website. 

Now the other way round, if you are not permitted, you can buy a Domain name matching to your name and write a personal blog which will promote you and you can capture the leads through it.

Why Blog? The Benefits of Blogging for Business and Marketing:
1) It helps drive traffic to your website.
2) It helps convert that traffic into leads.
3) It helps establish authority.
4) It drives long-term results.

Actually there are other reasons businesses might want to blog, but I think they're smaller and stray from the core benefits of blogging.
