<p>I have a domain for a site that I haven't put a lot of effort into and which isn't successful currently.</p>

<p>Someone requested to buy it, and I have absolutely no clue what to charge for it. Is there any objective way to make this sort of valuation?</p>

<p>Rather than setting a price for it and potentially robbing yourself, why not let whoever wants to buy it make an offer to you instead?  If the money sounds right and you're willing to let it go then sell it.  If not, keep it.</p>

<p>There are websites that purport to value a domain name.  You have to take any valuations as a rough guide, but it could be helpful to get you in the right ballpark.  I just did a Google search, and this link looks like a good start: </p>
