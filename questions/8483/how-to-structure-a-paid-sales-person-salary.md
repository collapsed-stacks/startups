I've been selling my software product for about 12 years via my website.  

It's a good product, probably the best in the space, but I can't compete with the marketing dollars my competitors have.  As such, I've just never had extra money to throw at a paid sales salary.

A friend of a friend as expressed interest in a Outside Sales Position and since my largest customer decided to renew, I wanted to give her a try.

In February 2016, what does a average software sales person compensation package look?

My average sales cycle is under a week or so and is about 3k....but that's with 'Me' doing it via a web lead....which I assume is a motivated buyer.

I don't get enough leads to keep a pipeline full, but I have a data.com account.

Does 3k a month, no benefits, 10% commission, and 25k monthly quota seem fair?

I expect that there will be a ramp up time, to fill the pipeline...so what...6 months?

Sorry, but I'm really in the dark here.
