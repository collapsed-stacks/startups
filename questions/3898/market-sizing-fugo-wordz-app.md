I am developing an app somewhat similar to Fugo's Wordz. I am curious how much income it has the potential to earn. 

Solely on their english app they got 115K downloads. 

But I guess only small portion of the user buy In-App. 

How would you estimate the size of their business?

This is the the app icon, just to remember. They are pretty popular in App Store.

The problem with word related apps is it's virtually impossible to predict.

At one extreme, you've offline games like Scrabble and apps like "Words with friends". Virtually everyone has or at least tried them. At the other, there's an enormous long tail of games that release to crickets or nearly so. In between, there's a slew of games that find their niche, and either thrive or muddle through.

You could fallback to comparing numbers of downloads of similar apps, and multiplying by a conversion rate, but even there things get thorny. On a website, a CR of 2-3% is typical, with some sites doing under 0.1% and others doing over 20%. If cursory googling is anything to go by, 1-3% in-app CR seems typical, but I'd be surprised if a similar spread didn't apply.

The point in the end is that the market for word apps *in general* is just about everybody who enjoys playing a game of Scrabble every so often -- which is to say nearly everyone who is literate. The market for apps *like Fugo's wordz* in particular, however, is anybody's guess imo. Trying to precisely quantify it will likely get you a margin of error of 100%.

Something that you *could* do is ask them directly. Assuming you're not creating a straight off clone, and you present it well, they might be cooperative and reply back. (In the entertainment business, it's mostly understood that clients are primarily shared, rather than taken away from one another. Or at least it should be.)
