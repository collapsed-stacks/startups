<p>I am stuck with the name of the domain / shop. Maybe you can help me with some fresh ideas.</p>

<p>The shop will focus on selling phones, accessories, and maybe I will extend to sell more type of products (like Amazon).</p>

<p>Also the problem is that I don't want that the name of the shop to contain keywords of the products, or "shop","market" and so on...</p>

<p>So, any help? </p>
