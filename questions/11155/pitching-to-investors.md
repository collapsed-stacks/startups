I have recently applied to join a startup competition and my startup has been selected as top 45. We are required to deliver a 2 mins pitch to a panel of investors who will judge us. 

My startup is a service that automatically recovers websites that have been hacked with minimal downtime.

My question:
The guidelines for the pitch require me to include how much i am raising and for how much equity. I have no idea how to answer this question. How do I know how much money I need and for how much equity?

Any help regarding this and pitching in general would be greatly helpful. Thank you!

I have several comments and then an answer:

- If you don't know how much money you need - then WHY are you pitching?
- you say that "my startup is a service that ...", so is the product built? Do you have a service that is selling to customers? Or is this just an idea with a prototype?

There is just not enough information in this question.
Either your startup is so early that it is barely in the idea stage, or you built a product you thought was cool - without thinking about anything else (like the customers, or building a business)

OK - all that being said.
At a pitch event, presumably in front of potential investors:

They want to know:

- What the product or service is.
- What kind of business it will be.
- Any evidence of customer need or market demand.
- Any Idea of how big the opportunity can be in the medium term and long term.
- Are the founders capable of executing a successful product and business.
- What kind of investments will be required to make the company a success.

You are asking here, about the last point. IF you are addressing the other questions, then - for the pitch event, all they need to know is the "ballpark"
answer to the question. (if you don't address those other questions, then they don't care how much money you need)

So ... if you don't have exact numbers or an analysis, then you will need to say things like:

- "this is very early stage right now - we are looking for enough seed capital to test the product and concept, so we can assess the market size and demand" (worst answer but still ... it's an answer)
- other companies doing something similar to our product have this $XYZ price point and revenues of $$.  We think we can exceed this in 3 years.
- We really don't know yet. We know that demand for anti-hacking products and services is an $X billion.
- We really don't know yet, but to get the product to the point where we have first sales, will take 3 more engineers and 9 months - so that is $100,000 and then another $1M and 1 year until breakeven.

Right now - everyone one of your responses will start out with 
"It's very early, and we really don't know for sure, but ...."

And also -I DO think there is a lot more information you can gather on your own, beforehand, to get a better, more accurate idea of how much money you will need, and how big the revenue opportunity is.

In an elevator pitch (in which you usually have 2-5 minutes of time to pitch), you should always try to focus on the main points such as 

 - What is it your company does
 - How many customers you have (Paying and Non-Paying)
 - How is it you plan to acquire new customer
 - How much are you raising
 - How are you different from your competitors (You may not necessarily name them but just give the bullet points as to what is it they do and how you do it differently as it saves time) 
 - How much equity are you willing to part with (depends on the platform where you're pitching)


Typically startups raise capital for anywhere between 12-18 months for their first round. You can calculate this number by adding up all the expenses you would have such as office rent, salaries, marketing budget, etc. 

As far as calculating the valuation of your company goes, various factors are included. One way you can go about it is by checking the deals that happened in your domain recently and seeing what multiple they used and using the same.
