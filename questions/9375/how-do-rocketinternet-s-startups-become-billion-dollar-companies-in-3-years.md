To answer the title of the question first, which I think is most important. The answers are mostly all in the article you linked to. There is investment capital, extreme aggressive forms of business and personnel  management and ruthless copying - frankly exploiting the ideas of other companies, as the article states: mostly by undercutting the competition.

To address the body of your question: Yes, in theory as the article demonstrates, but not without significant capital, and significant  management and staff to begin with.

To bring up something else here though that's not in the article, having had some contact with people who have worked for them, Rocket and its subsidiary companies don't just rely on internet ads, they are known to engage in targeted and aggressive real world leafleting if appropriate to the business, where they pay foreign workers a low wage to hand out a lot of promotional stuff.
