I would like to create an offshore structure with Private Interest Foundation and underlying business corporation.

There are two main offshore jurisdictions for foundations: Panama and Seychelles.

But what are the benefits of using one or another?

I know that in Seychelles it is stated in the Foundation Act itself that a foundation has no owners and that the foundation itself is the beneficial owner of the foundation assets.

Is this a big advantage for Seychelles foundations?

Are there any other advantages of one or another jurisdiction?

Insofar as I'm aware it's basically the same in both jurisdictions:

- Both are tax havens.
- Both allow to form a foundation with no owners.
- Both allow foundations to hold assets and own companies.

So on paper they enable the same thing from a tax avoidance standpoint.

In practice you want to open a business in neither, or in any other tax haven for that matter:

- Their banks *do* communicate with tax authorities.
- As such, you *will* get caught if you dodge your taxes.
- Doing business with companies in tax havens is a big red flag for tax authorities -- they'll investigate your clients and suppliers.

Tax havens are convenient for large businesses (and indeed, super rich individuals) who can field armies of lawyers. You cannot.
