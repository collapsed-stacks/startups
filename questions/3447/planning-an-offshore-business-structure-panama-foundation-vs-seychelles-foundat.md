<p>I would like to create an offshore structure with Private Interest Foundation and underlying business corporation.</p>

<p>There are two main offshore jurisdictions for foundations: Panama and Seychelles.</p>

<p>But what are the benefits of using one or another?</p>

<p>I know that in Seychelles it is stated in the Foundation Act itself that a foundation has no owners and that the foundation itself is the beneficial owner of the foundation assets.</p>

<p>Is this a big advantage for Seychelles foundations?</p>

<p>Are there any other advantages of one or another jurisdiction?</p>

<p>Insofar as I'm aware it's basically the same in both jurisdictions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Both are tax havens.</li>
<li>Both allow to form a foundation with no owners.</li>
<li>Both allow foundations to hold assets and own companies.</li>
</ul>

<p>So on paper they enable the same thing from a tax avoidance standpoint.</p>

<p>In practice you want to open a business in neither, or in any other tax haven for that matter:</p>

<ul>
<li>Their banks <em>do</em> communicate with tax authorities.</li>
<li>As such, you <em>will</em> get caught if you dodge your taxes.</li>
<li>Doing business with companies in tax havens is a big red flag for tax authorities -- they'll investigate your clients and suppliers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Tax havens are convenient for large businesses (and indeed, super rich individuals) who can field armies of lawyers. You cannot.</p>
