<p>I'm looking for data about how much money people put into certain outdoor activities in the province of Quebec, Canada. Specifically trekking, whitewater canoeing, climbing, sea kayaking and generally camping.</p>

<p>Are there any search engines for this type of data? I looked at statistics Canada but their website simply doesn't work half the time and I can't find what I'm looking for at all.</p>

<p>It's probably worth noting that I'm very new to market research (never done it before), so I might be missing something really obvious.</p>

<p>Hire a research company. If you can't afford to hire, you can do your own research. Ask many small business owners in Quebec near trekking-canoeing-kayaking-camping areas.</p>
