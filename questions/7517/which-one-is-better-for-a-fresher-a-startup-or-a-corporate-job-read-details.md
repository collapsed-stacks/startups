<p>I'm a CS undergrad graduating '16 from India. I have three Job offers in hand. I need to choose one. Here are the details:</p>

<p>About me: I'm an aspiring CS engineer, eager to work on any platform or technology. I'm a FOSS enthusiast, accepted in GSoC e.t.c. Ready to work in a challenging environment which provides ample learning and growth opportunities.</p>

<p>Company A: A multinational engineering and automotive manufacturing company. I might probably working on embedded systems or automation. The salary is low.</p>

<p>Company B: A biotechnology product development company. I might be working in services or data analytics / processing. The salary is decent.</p>

<p>Company C: A VC-funded, six-month old, city based startup in hyperlocal delivery space. Work in multidimensional. The salary is decent.
I'm struggling to choose between B and C. </p>

<p>Is it worth joining a startup whose growth is unpredictable? That too, in the beginning of the career? Please help.</p>

<p>Well at the end of the day it comes down to your own preferences and risk tolerance.</p>

<p>I'll say this though, the younger you are the more risk you're able to take. If you're just getting out of school, don't have a plethora of expenses, and maybe haven't established a family yet, a higher risk startup job might be a good fit for a few years. If it doesn't work out or you don't like the uncertainty you can always switch to something a little more corporate.</p>

<p>On the plus side, startups are great because you can get broader experience across multiple disiplines and force you to ramp up your skills quickly. If you are able to take some risk, enjoy a challenge, and can stomach the company maybe not working out, I'd say have at it.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>I would say that you should opt for a startup. In an established firm, you run the risk of being typecast. No doubt the company will be stable and the initial learning experience will be good, but in the long run (2-3 years down the line) you will be stuck in one position.</p>

<p>It's better you work in a startup where you will get more exposure and 'learn the ropes' much better. If the startup does well, then you will also grow along with the company.</p>

<p>As mentioned in an earlier answer, it depends on your capacity to take risk. The final decision rests with you.  </p>
