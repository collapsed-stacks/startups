<p>Google is the largest ad network out there. Yet it relies heavily on direct mail and traditional advertising methods, and as far as I know never uses the internet to market to ad buyers. Why? Is it worried about fraud?</p>

<p><a href="http://adage.com/article/digital/ana-report-7-2-billion-lost-ad-fraud-2015/302201/" rel="nofollow">Online ad fraud is indeed rampant</a>. Particularly on RTB platforms. Plus ad blockers. But I honestly doubt it's the reason.</p>

<p>Methinks the main reason is that they generally don't need to advertise online. You advertise to get awareness and to educate your prospects (and your clients). They're a public company that is so well established that they get press coverage all over on just about everything they do - cost free.</p>

<p>Plus, there's no shortage of coverage on how Google is "<a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/3075829/ios/android-wins-again-future-features-beat-apple-every-time.html" rel="nofollow">perpetually six months away from complete victory</a>".</p>

<p>Side note: I wasn't aware they were doing any offline advertising. But if so I'd gather it's to highlight devises to consumers who aren't tech-savvy or who don't follow tech news. Building brand awareness likely counts too - they've deep enough pockets for that.</p>
