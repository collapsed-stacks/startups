<p>Most popular mobile app growth engines are from apps where the users create content, like instagram, snapchat, twitter. Their engines are mostly about integrating with other social medias.</p>

<p>Not much is known about apps that are focused on consuming content. What are viable growth engines for these types of apps? Like Flipboard, Inoreader?</p>

<p>The bulk of Flipboard's growth is the result of unusual factors:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>They were first to market for all practical purposes. With a good app. And $10M+ of funding.</p></li>
<li><p>They were heavily pushed by Apple when iPad got released. They got named App of the year a bit later.</p></li>
<li><p>They integrated with Twitter, and piggybacked the latter's major growth period as they became the de-facto social magazine app.</p></li>
<li><p>They pushed RSS when Google Reader got shut down. This got them mentioned in gazillions of how to migrate from Google Reader posts and articles.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>There isn't much you can readily reproduce in the above... Particularly the last one.</p>

<p>An aspect that <em>is</em> somewhat reproducible is their blog. For instance, they got a lot of geek attention when they wrote about how they got 60fps on the mobile web -- it got fireballed, slashdotted, hackernewsed, redditted, you name it. And as you certainly know, geeks are the ones who recommend apps to family and friends.</p>

<p>Inoreader doesn't look like it's growing much. They've 5k FB Likes and 2k Twitter followers, vs ~140k and ~250k for Flipboard, and ~40k and ~95k for Feedly (which also grew because of Google Reader). If I were to make a guess, it's probably the result of the usual suspects: a combination of content marketing, SEO, PR, social media, forums, word of mouth, etc. -- the only difference being that they didn't get to piggyback Apple, Twitter, or Google.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=(Flipboard%20OR%20Feedly%20OR%20Pulse%20OR%20Inoreader%20OR%20google%20reader)%20%22growth%20hacking%22" rel="nofollow">Little bit of Googling for growth hacking mobile news aggregators</a> resulted in my finding this panel on <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Bay-Area-Mobile-Growth-Hackers/events/220939646/" rel="nofollow">Mobile Growth Hacking</a> - which included Deema Tamimi, Head of Product Marketing, for Flipboard; notes on the <a href="https://blog.branch.io/what-the-experts-taught-me-about-mobile-growth/" rel="nofollow">talk &amp; a recording of it are posted here</a>.</p>

<p>Number of nuggets present, which you can digout, but personally thought this one was nice:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Flipboard found that the number one reason people hadn’t been to the
  app in over 28 days, was that they basically forgot about it. With so
  many apps on a user’s phone, simple email reminders can be an
  effective tool for bringing back old users.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After reviewing the information, if you're still looking for more, you might try contacting Deema Tamimi (<a href="https://twitter.com/deemanator" rel="nofollow">@deemanator</a>) directly.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Forgot to mention that with tools like this, being able import feeds from other readers is a huge boost. For example, when Google Reader was shut down, number of the readers created "how to" pages just for a given reader, added import functionality, and promoted them with the press too.</p>
