<p>I don't really know if it ok to call it a creative studio, but I would like to know what are the steps, especially the legal ones to set a studio or a small company in UK as a student.</p>

<p>The studio's activity should be creating commercial mobile and computer programs, and as for size, somewhere between 1 and 5 members.</p>

<p>Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>UK has excellent government websites, including one with a to-the-point series that walks you through the process:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/set-up-business-uk/overview" rel="nofollow">https://www.gov.uk/set-up-business-uk/overview</a></p>

<p>In a nutshell:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/set-up-business-uk/register-your-business-in-the-uk" rel="nofollow">Register your business</a> as an Ltd.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/set-up-business-uk/setting-up-a-bank-account" rel="nofollow">Open a bank account</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/set-up-business-uk/national-insurance-and-vat" rel="nofollow">Register for national insurance</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/set-up-business-uk/national-insurance-and-vat" rel="nofollow">Register for VAT</a> if necessary or desirable.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that there are plenty of legal businesses that will take care of all of this BS for a few quids. Googling "form company uk" will yield plenty, as well as the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/register-a-company-online" rel="nofollow">UK's online company registration form</a>.</p>
