I don't really know if it ok to call it a creative studio, but I would like to know what are the steps, especially the legal ones to set a studio or a small company in UK as a student.

The studio's activity should be creating commercial mobile and computer programs, and as for size, somewhere between 1 and 5 members.

Thank you in advance.

UK has excellent government websites, including one with a to-the-point series that walks you through the process:

https://www.gov.uk/set-up-business-uk/overview

In a nutshell:

- [Register your business](https://www.gov.uk/set-up-business-uk/register-your-business-in-the-uk) as an Ltd.
- [Open a bank account](https://www.gov.uk/set-up-business-uk/setting-up-a-bank-account).
- [Register for national insurance](https://www.gov.uk/set-up-business-uk/national-insurance-and-vat).
- [Register for VAT](https://www.gov.uk/set-up-business-uk/national-insurance-and-vat) if necessary or desirable.

Note that there are plenty of legal businesses that will take care of all of this BS for a few quids. Googling "form company uk" will yield plenty, as well as the [UK's online company registration form](https://www.gov.uk/register-a-company-online).
