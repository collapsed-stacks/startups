I am looking to start a company in Japan, for which I need to have at least 5 million Yen.
I have been looking for business lenders throughout the internet, but they all seem to spend their money to businesses inside their national borders.

So my question is, are there any lenders at all who would lend you enough money to start your company in a foreign country on a foreign continent?

Finding somebody from oversea that invests into your startup will be difficult (but they do exist), partly because of legal as well as tax and audit challenges. Reading and understanding documents in a different language and with different rules is a big barrier.

I think you'd be better of finding initial investors within Japan.

At under $50K USD you can always try the Angel investor route. You can start with Crunchbase.com - you can do a search by investor location and industry/category.  You can also look for some guidance / information from "startup" law firms located in Japan for both lenders/investors.  Lastly, you can look to startup incubators - who may give you more than half of the cash you need.
