<p>My company is looking to raise a Series A round. My understanding is that there will generally be a lead VC that is in charge of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Finding other VCs to contribute to the round</li>
<li>Negotiating with the entrepreneurs</li>
<li>Doing due-diligence on behalf of the other investors</li>
<li>Organising legals on behalf of the other investors</li>
</ul>

<p>It seems the lead investor does more work than the other investor participants. How does the lead investor get compensated for that work? Do they get a better valuation than the other investors? Do they get "karma" with the other investors? Do they get other privileges?</p>

<p>I read an awesome book once - <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1119259754" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Venture Deals</a> and if I remember correctly one the biggest benefits a lead investor has is that they get to set the terms from the investor end i.e. what ever favors that particular lead investor. Usually for experienced VC's they already have a bunch of people who can carry out the due diligence for them while they also have a pool of other VC's they can rope in to contribute to the round. True on paper it sounds a lot but like I said for an experienced VC getting their terms on the board is their end goal.</p>
