My EIN is registered under my legal name.  Do I use that EIN for my DBA also?  Someone said the EIN must be in the business name

You got good advice. You technically can operate using the EIN under your name. But that'll mean _you_, as in your _unlimited_ liability pseudo-company, will be employing those you hire rather than the _limited_ liability company you (presumably) created.
