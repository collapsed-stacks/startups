<p>My EIN is registered under my legal name.  Do I use that EIN for my DBA also?  Someone said the EIN must be in the business name</p>

<p>You got good advice. You technically can operate using the EIN under your name. But that'll mean <em>you</em>, as in your <em>unlimited</em> liability pseudo-company, will be employing those you hire rather than the <em>limited</em> liability company you (presumably) created.</p>
