Am I breaking any laws by copying very common information such as countries, job titles, industries, etc.

An good example would be from Linkedin. Is it okay if I copy all the industry titles given here: https://developer.linkedin.com/docs/reference/industry-codes **exactly** as they are(e.g Package/Freight Delivery, Outsourcing/Offshoring).

P.S. If you can please give this post a better relative title ,please do :)

The codes you linked to are pretty common and likely derived from some .gov website, stats agency, or market data provider, rather than LinkedIn specific. You should be perfectly fine re-using them as is. If you don't feel comfortable doing so without checking with a lawyer there are quite a few other options, e.g.:
