<p>It seems like a no-brainer to me to take debt-based options over equity-based financing.</p>

<p>Is there an objective way to decide between the two? Furthermore, what are the advantages and disadvantages of each?</p>

<p>You haven't said <em>why</em> you consider debt to be more preferable than equity financeâ€”but one presumes it is some combination of:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>control is not shared with a lender</strong> (whereas equity investors with whom one may not always agree might exercise significant control over the business).  However, lenders may require certain <em>covenants</em> (i.e. contractual promises) that in reality restrict your freedom to control the business as you wish: for example, a bank may insist that there be no change of ownership or strategy so long as its debt remains outstanding; or they may require that certain performance targets be met.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>profits are not shared with a lender</strong> (whereas equity investors take a slice of everything you make).  However, the cost of debt finance (i.e. interest charges) does in fact reduce the business's profits; furthermore, it should not be ignored that <em>because</em> they don't share in the profits (nor are they exposed to as much risk), lenders have relatively little incentive to see the business succeed&mdash;thus equity investors will often go much further to help than a lender (and such help can be invaluable, especially during a startup's early years).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>interest payments on debt are tax-deductible</strong> (whereas dividends to equity investors are not).  However, this is only a benefit <em>provided that the profits are reinvested in the business's growth</em>: as soon as the profits are distributed to shareholders, tax must be paid.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>upon repayment of a loan, relationships with lenders draw to a close</strong> (whereas one can be stuck with equity investors for a long time).  However, in reality, one very often continues those relationships over multiple financing rounds (and walking away from such a key relationship can be difficult without raising concerns from future investors).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>debt is a relatively cheap source of finance</strong> (whereas equity investors expect a much higher return and thus take a much more costly share of the profits).  However, debt capital must be repaid with interest (which might be calculated at an unpredictable, variable rate); any breach of these or other covenants could ultimately lead to the business being wound up.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>debt enables an equity investment to be geared-up</strong>.  However, a leveraged business is more vulnerable should it fall upon tough times; indeed, shareholders will recognise this risk and be <em>less willing</em> to provide further equity finance to a highly geared business.  Furthermore, ensuring that covenants are not breached may stifle growth.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It's also worth bearing in mind that lenders may demand a charge over business assets or even personal guarantees that may be called upon in the event of default; whereas shareholders usually accept that their investment is higher risk and are willing to write-off their losses in the event of failure.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is there an objective way to decide between the two?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>It is a trade-off between risk and return.</strong>  There is no objective way to decide something that boils down to the personal risk appetites and cashflows of the shareholders involved: the exact same business could be entirely financed by equity (if backed by an investor with a low risk appetite but sufficient cash) or entirely by debt (if backed by an investor with a high risk appetite or insufficient cash).</p>

<p>In reality businesses tend to be financed by a mix of the two, according to the risk appetites and cash resources of the investors involved.</p>
