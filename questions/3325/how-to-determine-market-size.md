<p>I'm working on a product designed for Ruby developers. I need to find numbers and statistics on market size so that I can convince investors. Things like:</p>

<ul>
<li>total number of Ruby developers compared to other languages</li>
<li>total number of companies using Ruby on Rails</li>
<li>total percentage of startups using Ruby on Rails</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, how do I go about finding this type of information?</p>

<p>Most of the stats are about job postings and open source projects, because that is what is collectible.  Here are a few:</p>

<p>Ruby on Rails doesn't have the best looking market.  This page makes it sound more promising (although it's a little disingenuous because the data is outdated):</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Ruby on Rails has been trending downward recently:</p>

<p>Really, if you're not entirely stuck with Ruby on Rails, you may want to consider developing your product for a development environment that is trending up instead of down.  The best way to attract investors is to have better fundamentals - then it is less about selling and more about simply showing the facts.</p>

<p>Of course, if your tool represents a substantial step forward with the language, you may also begin to drive development there.  Also, Ruby is still the most-popular MVC environment out there.  You can point to a large base of users who know the language, even if they are working elsewhere, and then talk about how your specialized tools will make things much better, making Ruby a great development platform for certain kinds of use cases.  It's just a harder sell for investors if you have to make that kind of case.</p>

<p>So, is it too late to switch?</p>

<p>Adding what doesn't fit in a lengthy comment to Choirbean's answer, be wary that raw market figures are not the only thing that counts.</p>

<p>Consider for a moment that you're offering washing machine repair services. Within your city, you might have a heap of households, nearly all of them equipped with a washing machine, and say 5% of these machines breaking per year for some reason or another. Your addressable market is not 5% of the households. Because:</p>

<ul>
<li>Some households will just buy a new machine.</li>
<li>Some households will have a handyman around (husband, kiddo, cousin, neighbor, whatever).</li>
<li>Some households will make do with it, e.g. a small leak by putting a bucket or a mop around.</li>
<li>Etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>My point here is, even if you do have precise figures, you still won't be able to know what your addressable market.</p>

<p>To have a credible business model whatsoever, you need to identify a problem that you solve, which your prospects:</p>

<ol>
<li>actually have,</li>
<li>are actively trying to solve here and now when have it,</li>
<li>are willing to pay to resolve it; and</li>
</ol>

<p>Bonus points for being able to outline how to find them when they do. If you can do the latter, chances are you already have a product-market fit.</p>
