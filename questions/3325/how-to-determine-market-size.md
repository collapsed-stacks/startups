I'm working on a product designed for Ruby developers. I need to find numbers and statistics on market size so that I can convince investors. Things like:

 - total number of Ruby developers compared to other languages
 - total number of companies using Ruby on Rails
 - total percentage of startups using Ruby on Rails

In general, how do I go about finding this type of information?

Most of the stats are about job postings and open source projects, because that is what is collectible.  Here are a few:

Ruby on Rails doesn't have the best looking market.  This page makes it sound more promising (although it's a little disingenuous because the data is outdated):

Unfortunately, Ruby on Rails has been trending downward recently:

Really, if you're not entirely stuck with Ruby on Rails, you may want to consider developing your product for a development environment that is trending up instead of down.  The best way to attract investors is to have better fundamentals - then it is less about selling and more about simply showing the facts.

Of course, if your tool represents a substantial step forward with the language, you may also begin to drive development there.  Also, Ruby is still the most-popular MVC environment out there.  You can point to a large base of users who know the language, even if they are working elsewhere, and then talk about how your specialized tools will make things much better, making Ruby a great development platform for certain kinds of use cases.  It's just a harder sell for investors if you have to make that kind of case.

So, is it too late to switch?

Adding what doesn't fit in a lengthy comment to Choirbean's answer, be wary that raw market figures are not the only thing that counts.

Consider for a moment that you're offering washing machine repair services. Within your city, you might have a heap of households, nearly all of them equipped with a washing machine, and say 5% of these machines breaking per year for some reason or another. Your addressable market is not 5% of the households. Because:

- Some households will just buy a new machine.
- Some households will have a handyman around (husband, kiddo, cousin, neighbor, whatever).
- Some households will make do with it, e.g. a small leak by putting a bucket or a mop around.
- Etc.

My point here is, even if you do have precise figures, you still won't be able to know what your addressable market.

To have a credible business model whatsoever, you need to identify a problem that you solve, which your prospects:

1. actually have,
2. are actively trying to solve here and now when have it,
3. are willing to pay to resolve it; and

Bonus points for being able to outline how to find them when they do. If you can do the latter, chances are you already have a product-market fit.
