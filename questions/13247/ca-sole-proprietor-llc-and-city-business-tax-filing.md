I have a California LLC (sole proprietor) company that develops Android apps and puts it on Android play store for sales. It has a physical mailing address (a co-working space that has a physical address and gives me a suite number) in San Jose. Should this LLC be registered with the city's revenue department for 'business tax'? I have regularly filed Federal and state tax returns (Form 568 etc with $800 annual CA LLC fee) for the last few years. What are my obligations with the city or the county? Are there annual taxes (i.e. yearly fee for having a business operate out of the city) or taxes associated with the sales of apps in the app store? I would like to hear from LLC companies that are developing apps and posting on Android and iOS app stores, about what they have been doing.
