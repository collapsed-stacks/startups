I have a good idea for an application that I think many users will use and will definitely get success. I don't have any startup experience and will be doing it first time. If I talk about the idea it is a kind of freelancing app and we will be paying to the freelancers from our app, this may not look an unique idea but I don't want to reveal the key factor that makes it unique just now. So the problem is, I don't want to charge my users(end users) to charge for these services and also not interested in advertisements. So I am thinking how can I earn the money from this kind of idea?

1. You could offer payment insurance. Developers might be willing to buy insurance just in case the client cannot pay. Alternatively, you can get your clients to pay for insurance just in case the developer can't deliver.
You'll need some money to offset insurance cost though. 

2. Offer something that both clients and developers find difficult to set up. Maybe some sort of communication feature, or legal advice, legal forms, taxes, consultant, etc. These would be value on top of your main idea.
