<p>I'm a startup in hosting and currently not interested in hiring staff, so I wouldn't need a 'Jobs' page. However, IMO sites with a 'Jobs' page seem more legit.</p>

<p>So should I put up a 'Jobs' page even though I have no jobs available?</p>

<p>Just because you don't have any jobs at the moment, doesn't mean that you won't in the future, and that you cannot put up a framework already. Many companies have job pages which are location they can place jobs as they become available. </p>

<p>you're right in saying that it seems more 'legit', and I would offer a few key points.</p>

<p>1.Be tactful in how you say you aren't hiring on you jobs page. Perhaps you'll want a message that says something to the effect of "we aren't currently hiring" and encourage them to check back later. </p>

<p>2.Model it after the rest of the site. A common theme promotes recognition of the website, and allows the user to begin to familiarize that style with your company.In this instance, its a good thing that you have a jobs page since it allows the user to associate more with your site's style.</p>

<p>3.Lastly when you do begin hiring, be sure to post it there. Don't circumvent the very system you put in place.</p>

<p>So, in short, yes its just fine to have an empty jobs page.</p>

<p>You're coming at the question from the wrong end.</p>

<p>Hosting is a super competitive market. So presumably you're trying to position yourself in a distinctive way.</p>

<p>So sure, have a "Jobs" page. And on it, think of how to tell a story in two or three paragraphs about how that differentiation goes through the company, that starts with words something like these:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are no open positions at the moment, but we're always interested to
  hear from skilled engineers who share our values...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You have two options, be real, or be what you expect is expected.</p>

<p>I suggest being real, since it'll become clear pretty quickly who you are and who you are not, and most people don't like to be suprised.</p>

<p>So, more directly stated, unless you're hiring, do not claim to be hiring.</p>

<p>Having a "Jobs" page when you are not interested in hiring staff, to me, would make you less legit than not having a "Jobs" page. I don't know what industry you are in, but in my line of business (software development) there are lots of indie studios with great reputations that consist of 1 or 2 people, no plans to expand and definitely no "Jobs" page.</p>
