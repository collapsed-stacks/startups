<p>I am starting with a business on creating a online market, where you would be able to buy/rent/borrow celebrity's property (example: buying Justin Bieber car, renting Tom Cruise car, borrowing Warren Buffet's wristwatch). </p>

<p>The service would also allow you to order celebrity's service (example: order Jennifer Lopez's show at birthday party or have a private dinner with Sharon Stone).  </p>

<p><strong>Revenue model:</strong> <br />
Taking 5-10% from each transaction, adverts, freemium </p>

<p><strong>Why would celebrity use our service:</strong><br /> Easy way to make money. Imagine Justin Bieber and his, let's, 10 mansions. Instead of leaving them empty and unused when he isn't there, we give celebrities an opportunity to rent their mansions to the users of our service.  </p>

<p><strong>Who would be our customers:</strong><br /> HENRYs(Highly Earning But Not Rich Yet)<br>
What do you think of my business? :)  Any suggestions?</p>
