"Omni Smart Case gives you the ability to use your existing USB and HDMI devices while doubling the battery life of your Apple MacBook."

[Kickstarter link][1]

It's an innovative product that solves 2 problems MacBook users have: battery life and only one port. I think the project failed because it was only compatible with the 2015-2016 12 inch Apple MacBook. What do you think?

One possible factor:  Donors like gifts for lots of different donation levels. The campaign gives a gift for a $1 donation, then leaps to a $149 donation. Crowdfunding campaigns are more successful if there are gifts for many low-level donations:  $1, $5, $10, $20, $50, etc.

There are many sites that give you tips for a successful Kickstarter campaign (including Kickstarter itself!). Just Google "how to run a successful Kickstarter campaign". You can use that as a checklist to see which things the particular campaign lacked or did incorrectly.

You're asking for opinions from people who have no earthly idea.  Maybe it didn't attract enough interest from people on KickStarter because the person posting didn't know how to create a compelling campaign.  Maybe the product isn't appealing enough to people to justify them putting money into it.  Who knows?

We can speculate until the cows come home, but the *reality* is that the vast majority of KickStarter campaigns never achieve their goals.  It's the way things go.  

How often have you watched "Shark Tank" and seen a product/service that you really thought deserved money at first until you heard why the sharks hated it, and you found yourself going along with their reasoning?  The same applies here.

Just because ***you*** think it's a great product worth funding doesn't mean anyone else does or will, which is apparent from its lack of funding.  You could be right, but the market obviously didn't agree.

You seem to think Kickstarter is a place where ideas are tested and rewarded on their merits. That's the froth, not the ocean.

**Most Kickstarter projects provide a mechanism for the people you're already connected with to give you money in exchange for your promise.** It's entirely usual to find that 90%+ of the people who sign up were already connected.

So stop worrying about your ideas, focus on building your connections. If you need a thousand people to reach into their pockets, and you only have a hundred, that's where you need to put your time and effort today.
