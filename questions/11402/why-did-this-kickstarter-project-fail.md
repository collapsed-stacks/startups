<p>"Omni Smart Case gives you the ability to use your existing USB and HDMI devices while doubling the battery life of your Apple MacBook."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1549006272/omni-smart-case-the-first-smart-case-for-the-apple?ref=nav_search" rel="nofollow">Kickstarter link</a></p>

<p>It's an innovative product that solves 2 problems MacBook users have: battery life and only one port. I think the project failed because it was only compatible with the 2015-2016 12 inch Apple MacBook. What do you think?</p>

<p>One possible factor:  Donors like gifts for lots of different donation levels. The campaign gives a gift for a $1 donation, then leaps to a $149 donation. Crowdfunding campaigns are more successful if there are gifts for many low-level donations:  $1, $5, $10, $20, $50, etc.</p>

<p>There are many sites that give you tips for a successful Kickstarter campaign (including Kickstarter itself!). Just Google "how to run a successful Kickstarter campaign". You can use that as a checklist to see which things the particular campaign lacked or did incorrectly.</p>

<p>You're asking for opinions from people who have no earthly idea.  Maybe it didn't attract enough interest from people on KickStarter because the person posting didn't know how to create a compelling campaign.  Maybe the product isn't appealing enough to people to justify them putting money into it.  Who knows?</p>

<p>We can speculate until the cows come home, but the <em>reality</em> is that the vast majority of KickStarter campaigns never achieve their goals.  It's the way things go.  </p>

<p>How often have you watched "Shark Tank" and seen a product/service that you really thought deserved money at first until you heard why the sharks hated it, and you found yourself going along with their reasoning?  The same applies here.</p>

<p>Just because <strong><em>you</em></strong> think it's a great product worth funding doesn't mean anyone else does or will, which is apparent from its lack of funding.  You could be right, but the market obviously didn't agree.</p>

<p>You seem to think Kickstarter is a place where ideas are tested and rewarded on their merits. That's the froth, not the ocean.</p>

<p><strong>Most Kickstarter projects provide a mechanism for the people you're already connected with to give you money in exchange for your promise.</strong> It's entirely usual to find that 90%+ of the people who sign up were already connected.</p>

<p>So stop worrying about your ideas, focus on building your connections. If you need a thousand people to reach into their pockets, and you only have a hundred, that's where you need to put your time and effort today.</p>
