<p>Iâ€™ve been experimenting with incorporating state of the art Artificial intelligence algorithms with traditional logic based reasoning systems and wanted to explore the commercial viability of such a product.  What it does is that if you feed in text data it should basically be able to - </p>

<ol>
<li>Answer natural language questions even if they require some logical reasoning</li>
<li>Come up with relevant information after carrying out an analysis by itself related to questions that the user has asked in the past. </li>
</ol>

<p>Can anyone point me to potential applications that I should consider or industry that might find use for such a product?</p>

<p>Law firms would probably pay good money if they could enter the facts of a case, and your A.I. could return relevant case law or even suggest approaches for arguing one side or the other.</p>

<p>In business, your system could (possibly) analyze a business plan and point out pitfalls or even missed opportunities.</p>
