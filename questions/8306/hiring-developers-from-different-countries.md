I have a startup idea that I want to hire developers with specific expertise. However, I can't find such developers in my country, so I need to hire developers remotely.

One of my greatest fears is that when the application is ready for production, the developer can 'steal' the code and use it himself and make it better to compete against me. Because the app isn't known to people yet, and because we are working from two different countries I think that I might not be able to do anything.

Am I right? If so how do I solve such problem?

First thing, you are not alone to have this fear about getting your idea stolen. And luckily there are ways to mitigate the risk. Here are couple of them -

 - Choose a small agency or tech shop over freelancers. 
 - Take some time before you finalize the vendor - Talk to them couple of time, check their long term perspective about their company. You need to confirm they are in this with a long term perspective. Stealing your idea will be negative for them.
 - Ask them to sign NDA.
 - You can put a clause for your rights in case your application can be launched internationally and your vendor taking lead in that.
 - Go with the partnership mindset, a longer term perspective over short term gain. But go slow with the assignments.
 - Tech is an important part of any application but securing customers, marketing, costing, there are so many other things, which I believe you can do better than a tech shop.
 - Stop getting worried and Ship It :-)

I raised hundreds of thousands at 19. Kept my idea so secret my girlfriend didn't know until 15 months into our relationship. I have 6 partners. We blew $100K+ with two tech-shops.

Why? 

**1. 5/95 RULE**

Keeping your idea secret will kill you and your idea.

We were so secrete that it was more of a cult (financially + emotionally harmful cult) than a startup. 

No one will steal your idea. People will disagree with me on this to death. But people have bills to pay, projects to work on, IDEAS OF THEIR OWN! There are millions of ideas. But it's all about execution. 5% idea. 95% execution. I'd give less than 5% to the idea since the idea changes a ridiculous amount along the way.

The more you tell people about your idea the more feedback you'll get and the more you'll understand people's needs. This is by far my biggest regret with this first startup. 

**2. IF YOU'RE NOT DOING IT ON YOUR OWN YOU WILL FAIL**

Do not EVER hire a software development (tech shop, etc) company to do it for you.

We hired a software company to build it. They robbed us. Literally. Legal crime. Lied to us. Delayed the project. Then I learned how to code. And realized 750 hours of $work is really only about 10 hours of "engineering".

Then we hired another. 

**3. FREELANCERS**

They won't steal your ideas. You should go to UpWork.com and find a developer there. Make sure he's yours (or she) and that he's going to tell you "no" when you're asking to build a stupid idea. Make sure you have enough cash for 30hrs a week (at least) for at least 6 months.

**4. READ STARTUP LITERATURE** 

A. The Lean Startup - Eric Ries (You'll die without this)
     - Read this before building and spending a dime. 
B. Read the references in the book then read those books. 
c. Zero to One - Peter Thiel (Will teach you what not to build and what to build and how to build it)
D. Trust Me I'm Lying - Ryan Holiday (Marketing bible)

**5. NDAs DON'T HELP**

If someone steals your idea, it'll be very hard for you to sue them VERY hard. IP (intellectual property) law is very tough... Look at products all around you (Google, Bing, iPhone, Samsung) . People copy each other even though things are patented. NDAs can only do so much. If that person who steals your idea gives a tiny twist to the idea, then it's a different idea. You lost. 

Screw NDAs. Anyways, who said your idea will succeed? 

**6. DON'T EVER HIRE A TECH SHOP**

I can't emphasize this point enough. 

-- 

Go to UpWork, find someone from a cheap labor country like India, Bangladesh, Romania or Ukraine. Have them sign an NDA (if that makes you feel better because you'll have a hard time enforcing that in any of those countries) and then there you go. You can watch them code because it's recorded. They only work when the camera is running so you're sure they're not screwing you. And bam, you can call the developer 24/7 and ask them hows it going, or to change something or to fix a bug. 


Either way, if you're not in 110% in control you're destined to fail. 

Good-luck.

You can outsource the work but assign each developer a specific task. Don't give them the complete picture. Just give them enough to work on and a clear idea of what you expect from them. If you are paying them then they will work, no questions asked. 

It will be your responsibility to put together their work and make sure that things are running smoothly.
