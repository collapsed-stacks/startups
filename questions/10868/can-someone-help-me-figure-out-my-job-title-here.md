<p>In the past I was hired as a freelancer by two startups, officially for marketing. But everytime I ended up in another position. I was the guy who asks "stupid" questions like "what is this for?", "why is this here?", "what is the idea behind this?" and so on. And then also coming up with new ideas.</p>

<p>How would you call this job?</p>

<p>It's a bit hard to say without more details, but if the questions were tied to what a product was doing and its features were for, the work might probably be best described as customer development, product management, or management control - i.e. the person who is running around challenging why things got done this or that way, with the intent of keeping the product aligned with client needs and the costs in check.</p>

<p>Try Product Analyst. Those kinds of questions are those that an analyst would ask. It is not clear what you specifically are questioning, but I assume that you are asking with a view to market the product. Then you need understand how it works so you can explain it to your customer. </p>

<p>How about Product Control? Product Enhancement? It could also be part of Product Development or Process Improvement.</p>
