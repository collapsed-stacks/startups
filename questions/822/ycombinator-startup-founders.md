According to the home page:

> Y Combinator is a community of over 1,400 founders.

Where can I find a complete list of these founders, or how would I go about finding one?

(I've attempt combo searches of a [sample list of known founders][1] without any luck.)

<p>Appears the search term is "<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=YC%20alumni%20network" rel="nofollow">YC alumni network</a>" - and though I'm currently unable to find a complete list of alumni, this <a href="http://yclist.com/" rel="nofollow">list of Y Combinator companies</a> appears to be complete.</p>
