I have plan to software company ( WordPress themes and plugins business). But I will do web design business also same time because it gives quick money when I got a project. So this question about finding a marketing person for web design business.


I read https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/17/i-have-a-great-idea-but-im-not-great-at-marketing-or-sales-how-do-i-approach .


I have the same story. But, because of my bad experiences I don't like to work with partner. Partner means you have share ideas, profit and it is hard to get dessions sometime. I have really bad experince about that. So I can't go with that way.

So I thought to hire a person to marketing the web design business. I want just only 2-3 web design project per month. So what I expect from marketer is giving 2,3 projects for my company. That's only.

**But my problem is how I find that type of person?**  

Note : My main business will be "WordPress themes and plugins business". But generate profit from it, it takes nearly 1 year because developers need time to develop them. I have plan to use web design business to make quick money in that period. (I have 5 years experience as a full stack developer so I can make websites very quickly specially using CMSs.)

How much are you ready to pay?

The easiest way would be to hire a freelancer in my opinion since you don't want a partner. Anyway, this requires some basic fundament about marketing, before you will hire such a person.

I would suggest you change your mind and give another chance for a new partner. Try to build around your project great team, it's going to be way easier if you will make it.

Fivver.com has tons of want ads and people posting skills. You should contact one of the users in the Marketing Section or another section, I don't think it matters which one, and ask about marketing.
