<p>I have plan to software company ( WordPress themes and plugins business). But I will do web design business also same time because it gives quick money when I got a project. So this question about finding a marketing person for web design business.</p>

<p>I read <a href="https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/17/i-have-a-great-idea-but-im-not-great-at-marketing-or-sales-how-do-i-approach">I have a great idea, but I&#39;m not great at marketing or sales. How do I approach this?</a> .</p>

<p>I have the same story. But, because of my bad experiences I don't like to work with partner. Partner means you have share ideas, profit and it is hard to get dessions sometime. I have really bad experince about that. So I can't go with that way.</p>

<p>So I thought to hire a person to marketing the web design business. I want just only 2-3 web design project per month. So what I expect from marketer is giving 2,3 projects for my company. That's only.</p>

<p><strong>But my problem is how I find that type of person?</strong>  </p>

<p>Note : My main business will be "WordPress themes and plugins business". But generate profit from it, it takes nearly 1 year because developers need time to develop them. I have plan to use web design business to make quick money in that period. (I have 5 years experience as a full stack developer so I can make websites very quickly specially using CMSs.)</p>

<p>How much are you ready to pay?</p>

<p>The easiest way would be to hire a freelancer in my opinion since you don't want a partner. Anyway, this requires some basic fundament about marketing, before you will hire such a person.</p>

<p>I would suggest you change your mind and give another chance for a new partner. Try to build around your project great team, it's going to be way easier if you will make it. </p>

<p>Fivver.com has tons of want ads and people posting skills. You should contact one of the users in the Marketing Section or another section, I don't think it matters which one, and ask about marketing. </p>
