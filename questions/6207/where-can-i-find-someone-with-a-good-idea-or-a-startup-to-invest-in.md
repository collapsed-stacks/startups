I have an accounting background and I've been working for multinational companies for years. I would like to take the risk of investing in a small company/product. I also have some ideas for softwares/apps that I would like to discuss their viability with someone with a good knowledge of programming.

<p><a href="https://angel.co/" rel="nofollow">Angel.co</a> is a great place to invest in startups or find some worth investing in. You can also pitch you own startup ideas on there and they have a possibility of getting funded. I would also recommend <a href="https://wefunder.me/" rel="nofollow">wefunder.com</a> - it is also a great place to invest in startups.</p>

PM me ;)

A joke - but still on point. Network your way into a circle of tech people, and you'll find a lot of ideas that are begging for funds. I'm in the opposite situation - my colleagues, friends and I have far too many ideas, and not enough funds. We need people like you for us to pitch to and haggle with!

I think getting into an idea-heavy network has some upsides compared to online listings, as there's more opportunity to suss people out, and more potential for recommendations & warnings from peers. Though you'll likely find that the ideas haven't achieved as much progression.
