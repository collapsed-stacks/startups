<p>Can two similar but not identical Trademarks be registered in a single industry, if both contains generic words?</p>

<p>For example, could I register <code>bell burgers</code> if <code>bell place burgers</code> is already registered? If yes, could the competitor challenge the registration?</p>

<p>It's always tough to say whether two trademarks would be found to be in conflict of each other. That's a human process performed by humans at the Patent and Trademark Office, so the conclusions they draw can be subjective.</p>

<p>But speaking from a purist perspective, I can tell you more or less what they're looking for.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Not confusing</strong>: The point of trademarks is to avoid <em>consumer confusion</em>, which means if people look at Bell Burgers and associate it with Bell Place Burgers, that's a problem. By extension, if you opened up a salon, for random example, under the name "Bell Salon," that probably wouldn't be confusing to anyone, and you'd be golden.</li>
<li><strong>Not descriptive</strong>: I mention this one because you brought up "generic words." I'm not sure it's directly relevant here, but a trademark isn't valid if it's descriptive of the service or product being offered. In other words, if you were referring to a burger joint called "The Hamburger Place," that probably wouldn't make it through as a trademark, regardless of what other businesses were or were not in place with the name. If the word "Bell" was somehow descriptive or necessary to compete, it wouldn't be valid.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, it's important to understand how trademark challenges work.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Pre-grant</strong>: When a trademark examiner looks at your mark, he or she does some searching to find whether it might be confusing with any other relevant marks.</li>
<li><strong>Post-grant</strong>: When a trademark holder comes up and says "Hey, your mark is confusing to consumers, I'm going to sue you if you don't stop," they then have to <em>prove</em> that your mark did actually confuse people. It's no longer a subjective matter of whether people might be confused.</li>
</ul>

<p>As such, those are two very different questions that you asked. I wouldn't feel comfortable on a platform such as this jumping up and telling you that the examiner would feel one way or the other, nor that the public would. But hopefully this can lend a bit of insight to help you make a decision.</p>

<p>Of course, as usual, speaking with a trademark attorney might be of assistance.</p>
