<p>What are the advantages and disadvantages of Y Combinator? Their value of mentorship, easy seed funding, social proof ("Investors fight to invest in YC companies at sky-high prices.") are obvious.</p>

<p>What are the other advantages of YC I am missing? Are there disadvantages that should be known? Are they better at helping a certain startup type (eg Saas) and not very beneficial to other types (e.g. ecommerce)?</p>

<p>I don't have direct experience with YC, but I've been tangentially involved with some folk who've been through the application process. The advantages are, at the core, being plugged into a fantastic network of people. That brings you <em>much</em> easier access to money, knowledge, people, PR, etc. Of those, access to knowledge and people are probably the biggest advantages.</p>

<p>The disadvantages are really more like constraints:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>They are upfront on being biased against single founders. Their preference is for at least a couple of people or a team, because they've found single founders fail more. That doesn't mean you won't get it, but it makes it much less likely.</p></li>
<li><p>They are upfront on being biased against folk without technical knowledge on the team. Again, doesn't mean you won't get it if you don't have any, but makes it much less likely.</p></li>
<li><p>You have to (re)incorporate your company in the US. </p></li>
<li><p>You have to move to the Bay area for three months. Depending on where you are now, the current state of your company &amp; personal life, etc. that can be a real issue legally and logistically.</p></li>
<li><p>The application process sucks some time up. As does the interviewing process if you get that far. Time can be a very precious resource for a startup. (Although there is an upside even if you don't get into YC. Spending the time to think about the application can actually help people understand their own company better).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>And finally YC is a company that makes it's money by companies being VC-level successful. So their interests may not be aligned with the founders (e.g. if a company has a low-risk option to be a $2 million annual revenue company, and a high-risk option of being a $200 million revenue company, YC will be heavily biased to the latter, while founders may be more than happy with the former). But this is more of a general VC thing than a YC specific issue.</p>

<p>Some of this is covered in the <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/faq/" rel="nofollow">YC FAQ</a>.</p>

<p>It seems like you covered the major advantages in your question. Other advantages will probably be more of opinions.</p>

<p>I can't give a good direct answer to your question but I can refer you to few great sources for learning more about their value proposition to your startup:</p>

<ol>
<li>A YouTube channel with a recent series of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxIJaCMEptJjxmmQgGFsnCg" rel="nofollow">20 lectures by YC mentors</a></li>
<li><a href="http://paulgraham.com/index.html" rel="nofollow">Paul Graham's page</a>, it look very basic and old fashioned but the essays are very interesting and useful. </li>
</ol>

<p>I think that if you go through those two you will have a good idea whether YC fits to your venture. </p>
