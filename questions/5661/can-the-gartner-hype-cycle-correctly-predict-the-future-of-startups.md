IT Advisory firm Gartner has developed many methods and tools to view the development of a company. [Hype Cycle][1] is one of these tools. How correct is it in predicting future of startups (considering them to be technologies) ?

<p>No, it can't. And it's not intended to.</p>

<p>Gartner's Hype Cycle methodology provides a graphical view of the maturity, adoption and business application of specific technologies. But it is not made to analyze the success probability of a startup.</p>

<p>If you're looking to improve your ability to predict startup future success, you should pay attention to <a href="https://twitter.com/Bill_Gross" rel="nofollow">Bill Gross</a> research.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bill Gross is the Founder of American incubator Idealab, which has in
  the past two decades been responsible for launching over <strong>100
  companies</strong>, including Citysearch, CarsDirect, GoTo, NetZero and
  Tickets.com, to name a few.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He has recently given a talk at <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/bill_gross_the_single_biggest_reason_why_startups_succeed?language=en" rel="nofollow">TED</a> where he explain, based in his experience, why <strong>TIMING</strong> is the single biggest reason why startups succeed. </p>

<p>The other (important) factors would be <strong>Idea</strong>, <strong>Team</strong>, <strong>Business Model</strong> and <strong>Funding</strong>. But from all, Timing is the most important one.</p>

<p>So maybe, somehow, you could use Gartner Hype Cycle to compare the timing between the launch of a startup and the "phase" the technology is in. But again, I don't think it would be a great tool to predict anything.</p>

The Hype Cycle is a very general observation. It is roughly equivalent to saying that the majority of businesses will fail in the first year. All it gives you is a probability without telling you how to beat the odds. And cannot at all predict what will happen in an individual case.

Also, while the cycle describes a typical trend for new technologies, the length of each stage is different for each; and the amplitude, if measurable at all, differs for each new technology.

Now to address your question, "Can this be applied to individual start-up businesses?"

While the Hype Cycle can describe a macro-trend for all businesses and individuals promoting a new technology, it does not work at all to describe the behavior of the single entities that are part of that macro-environment.

To the contrary, most startups follow quite different trajectories including a sudden take off and a quick crash, a slow start that does a sudden hockey stick, a slow start and agonizing death, or a parabolic take-off growing beyond all probability. The few that do follow the trend are the exception not the rule.
