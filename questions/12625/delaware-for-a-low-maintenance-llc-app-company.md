<p>I am currently doing beta-testing on a relatively simple to design and maintain app that may have some room for growth in the future. I'm looking at something like a SMLLC (single member).</p>

<p>At the moment I would be a single owner, and was toying with Delaware incorporation as oppose to domestic California. Would running a business through the app store constitute operating in California and I need to do special processing? Based on previous LLC experience the CA LLC process took quite a while and seems bloated, so I'm just trying to figure out if I can minimize my interactions with it.</p>

<p>If you live in California, then you will have to register your Delaware LLC there, and you will still have to put up with all the annoying hassles of having an LLC in California.</p>

<p>There is no benefit in creating a Delaware LLC.  It will just create obligations for you in two states (DE and CA) instead of just CA.</p>
