We are trying to develop a small portable speaker unit with blue tooth capabilities, LED lighting, and ideally an app to manage it.

How do I find a designer (engineer?) who can:
1) design the electronics,
2) design the case it will be mounted in 
3) build a prototype for evaluation

Thank you! Ken

You're looking for an engineer, with expertise in e.g. electronics and/or signal processing and/or telecommunications. The three fields interconnect heavily, so you should be fine with any of them if you find some kind of specialist in one of the fields that you're happy with.

That being said, I hate to be asking, but... this question and the comments on its [dup in the audio design SE](https://sound.stackexchange.com/questions/42151/how-to-find-a-audio-designer-that-also-can-help-with-prototype) kind of begs a question: are you sure you're bringing enough to the table that such an engineer might want to work for/with you?

Post an announcement. 

To eliminate candidates not interested in working for startups, use portals that focus on startups only (something like http://www.earlyhire.ch/ for Switzerland). There you can put any conditions, up to offering CTO with no salary.
