<p>We are trying to develop a small portable speaker unit with blue tooth capabilities, LED lighting, and ideally an app to manage it.</p>

<p>How do I find a designer (engineer?) who can:
1) design the electronics,
2) design the case it will be mounted in 
3) build a prototype for evaluation</p>

<p>Thank you! Ken</p>

<p>You're looking for an engineer, with expertise in e.g. electronics and/or signal processing and/or telecommunications. The three fields interconnect heavily, so you should be fine with any of them if you find some kind of specialist in one of the fields that you're happy with.</p>

<p>That being said, I hate to be asking, but... this question and the comments on its <a href="https://sound.stackexchange.com/questions/42151/how-to-find-a-audio-designer-that-also-can-help-with-prototype">dup in the audio design SE</a> kind of begs a question: are you sure you're bringing enough to the table that such an engineer might want to work for/with you?</p>

<p>Post an announcement. </p>

<p>To eliminate candidates not interested in working for startups, use portals that focus on startups only (something like <a href="http://www.earlyhire.ch/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.earlyhire.ch/</a> for Switzerland). There you can put any conditions, up to offering CTO with no salary.</p>
