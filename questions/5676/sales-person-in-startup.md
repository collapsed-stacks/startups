I wonder if there is any specific site, portal, etc., where I can find sales persons that would like to join startup and get a percentage of company instead of salary in beginning?

Try meetup.com et al, cofounderslab.com et al. There are many sites, basically.

Prefer someone who you can interact with face to face; or someone with a good track record.

If you don't have the slightest bit of traction, [aim for half of your company](https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/5582/how-to-distribute-ownership-fairly-amongst-founders); or a third if you've a co-founder already. Vested, of course. Because without a salary you're looking for a co-founder.
