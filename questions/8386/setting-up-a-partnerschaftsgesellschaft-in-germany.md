I would like to register a Partnergesellschaft with the financial authorities of Germany. 

Do you know if I need to to register first as "Freiberufler" or is there no need to do so ?

<p>There is no need to register as a "Freiberufler" - you can do this only if your education and work matches some requirements. There is a list of professions which qualify for that (<a href="https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/estg/__18.html" rel="nofollow">ยง18 (1) EStG</a>). I would recommend to check with the fiscal authorities for that.</p>

<p>Partnergesellschaft is a legal form for Freiberufler to work as a company together. As with a GmbH, a Partnergesellschaft needs to be registered.</p>
