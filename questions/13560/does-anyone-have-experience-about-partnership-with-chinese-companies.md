I have built an educational robot, and have it's prototype. But I have no money for mass production. Also no marketing experience and marketer. Plus that, I must buy almost every part of my robot from China(computer board, motors, LCD, even plastic molded body).

So I thought it's better to work with a company in China. They do mass production and marketing for me, like what they do for big companies like apple, etc. 

But I don't know:

> 1-Do they work as like as what I am looking for?
>
 2-Are there any common rule or convention to estimate how percentage of profits will become for me? 
>
3-Is this a safe way? what if a company saw my product
> and said NO to me but got the idea and make it for itself?
>
>4-How should I search and find the companies may accept my situation and do this for me?


Also I will be happy to hear any other experience and suggestions!

As stated in my comment, I think you are doing it the, wrong way. Your question should be something like: "From prototype to production. What are the steps of creating a successful product in the education toy industry?" . Maybe there is a community which will be glad to answer such a question?

Now still let me try to answer the question, as if you already did build up a supply chain blueprint and here is the first thing to consider: if you go to China you have to think big. 10.000-100.000 pieces at least. You really need to have the whole process, from production to distribution planned and be ready to be executed.

The following is maybe a little bit exaggerated, but is true in some sense.

1. Culture shock: Chinese (+Indians) have a different expectation, as most Europeans and American have in terms of quality and details. It's not like they won't deliver a car, if you ask them to, but if you are not 100% specific you will get a lawnmower motor on a cupboard with wheels.

Also, Chinese have an other way of handling problems . They are smiling and tell you everything is alright, even if the whole building is on fire.

2. Shares: There is no rule of how to split all earnings and revenues. Looking at the value chain, most of the time you need to multiple the costs of production+delivery+taxes+toll+etc. by 2. That should be your price (hopefully your market is willing to pay it). How to distribute? Well... That's not possible to decide right now. But you should keep your shares together, for investors. Producers can be replaced, but they are coupled to tight.

3. NDA: That should be answered here at stack exchange. I'm on mobile right now. I add a link in a few hours.

4. Find partner: Short answer you can't. You need someone how has experience with that. The best solution would be a  business coach or angle. Think about skills and how you can build a team to gather all necessary requirements.
