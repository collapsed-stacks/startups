<p>I'm in the need for a person to provide marketing / SEO expertise to clients and whilst I know what I need the end result to be, how can I hire for a position when I don't know what the day to day tasks involve and exactly what results should be expected? Is it just the case of looking for someone with a proven track record and going with it?</p>

<p>What about asking the question "what the day to day tasks involve and exactly what results should be expected" to the potential candidates? That way you can compare the answers and pick the one that makes the most sense. Also, it would be a test if those people can explain how they work in a plain language, which would help to communicate down the road. </p>
