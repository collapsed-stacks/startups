<p>It has just finished for this year, but there is Microconf in Europe.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>a two-day conference focused on self-funded startups and single founder software companies</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.microconfeurope.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.microconfeurope.com</a></p>

<p>Is that the type of thing you are looking for?</p>
