<p>I think most small startups are founded by people who are friends, business associates, or at least acquaintances - in other words, people that you already know and trust. You can also ask for recommendations from friends and family.</p>

<p>But that applies to founders, which may need to work together for years and years. Teammates may be different, since they may come and go. For example, you may hire a programmer for one module of a website or application, and that may only take a month. After that point, you could decide whether to work with that person again. Since the relationship is shorter, and possibly has less of an impact on your business, you may be able to find teammates (contractors) through typical channels: ads on job sites, real-world ads (like posted flyers at universities), Craigslist ads, etc.</p>
