When using paypal as the main means of processing payments there is always a risk of someone attempting a chargeback.

What can I do to lower the chances of chargebacks from people who had every intention of scamming in the beginning?

Fraud detection is a wide topic. The #1 improvement to reduce chargebacks is to only accept to ship items to the verified address of the buyer (the one that matches their billing address).

If they have bad intentions, they will generally fall into patterns that ordinary innocent customers do not. You need to screen your transactions for fraud, or/and remove the incentive for bad guys.

<p>You should integrate fraud screening into your order review and fulfillment processes. Depending on whether your business is online-only, there are some good software solutions out there for fraud prevention. <a href="http://maxmind.com" rel="nofollow">MaxMind</a> and <a href="https://www.jumio.com/netverify/" rel="nofollow">Jumio NetVerify</a> are some that I know of. </p>

<p>It will be effective to look for patterns among customers who end up being fraudulent or chargeback accounts. If they have something in common like country of origin, certain free email providers, etc., then you can take measures to block or restrict orders with those attributes, using your online store / shopping cart software.</p>

<p>Additionally, you can implement a manual order review process, for example checking the user's address, IP address, and other factors; requesting a copy of identification from suspect customers; etc.</p>
