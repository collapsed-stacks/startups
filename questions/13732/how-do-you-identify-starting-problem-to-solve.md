When you want to make your own start-up, you should identify a specific problem. And then try to make a solution for that problem.

My question is:

    How do you find a given problem to solve?

One solution is to look around my atmosphere, and track the people's complain. The situation is, i know few people, with limited difficulties. 

**How can i identify more and more problems?**

At this point, i am not interested in solutions, but the questions. *I would like to make a pool of problems*, which all of them have the potentiality to be an start-up. In other word, ***from where do you collect your problems?***

<p>Be more picky about problems! They don't have to change the world.</p>

<p>One example that comes to mind is frying bacon. That doesn't sound bad at all, right? But during the process, the "cook" has to remove excess grease, and some people choose to blot excess grease off the cooked bacon with a paper towel. Those simple things can be classified as a problem! A young girl and her dad did just that and became rich.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One Saturday morning, when I was 8 years old, my dad and I were cooking bacon. My dad had to put the bacon on the classified section of the newspaper because he ran out of paper towels and my mom freaked out. Dad made a wise crack and said, "I could just stand here and let it drip dry." I thought about it and said that if bacon cooked hanging up with a bowl below - then you wouldn't need paper towels.  So dad and I went to work. We made all kinds of gadgets that cooked the bacon above the fat, not in it. Eventually we came up with our first MAKIN BACON dish. It was great. We made a bowl with a handle and three bars to hang the bacon on. It cooked great too.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Her product is <a href="https://www.makinbacon.com/index.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Makin' Bacon</a>. It's for sale in Walmart and online. They got RICH off of it.</p>

<p>So look for <em>anything</em> that is a nuisance, inconvenient, messy, slow, or just slightly irritating. That might lead to an invention!</p>
