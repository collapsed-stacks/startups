I am working on a product which provides my customers a business relevant website - I am thinking about first targeting Cafe owners but the problem is to convince them that why should they have a website while their cafe is listed in zomato?

You need ask yourself this - honestly - I mean, why would anyone want to use your product/service if they are already on zomato. What makes your service any better? *Is your service the same even?* Do you offer additional features at a lower cost? Do you have greater reach? Why would I, as a restaurateur take money out of my pocket and put it into yours? I suggest you read an excellent (old but very excellent) book called *Confessions of an Advertising Man* by a chap called David Ogilvy.
