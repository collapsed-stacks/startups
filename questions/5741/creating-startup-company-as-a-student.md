<p>I am 14 years old student living in Ukraine. I have my own idea that I want to realise: run my own business and sell my product(s) worldwide. I want to create an accessory for iOS devices. I have experience as an iOS developer and worked with embedded computing development boards such as <a href="http://arduino.cc" rel="nofollow">Arduino</a> and <a href="http://www.ti.com/launchpad" rel="nofollow">LaunchPad</a>. I want to use <a href="https://developer.apple.com/homekit/" rel="nofollow">Apple's HomeKit</a>. To developer iOS application for HomeKit-enabled
 accessory I only need <a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/" rel="nofollow">Apple Developer Program</a>, which I have. But to develop HomeKit hardware, I need <a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/mfi/" rel="nofollow">Apple MFI license</a>. It is available only for officially registered companies and need validations. So my question is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is there any official way to register company to a person with <strong>NO</strong> age of majority? If yes, how much does it cost and what is procedure of doing that?</li>
<li>Is there any website like <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com" rel="nofollow">Kickstarter</a> available in Ukraine and available for students?</li>
</ol>

<p>You have two problems:</p>

<ol>
<li>Underage: in most places, anything you sign is void and doesn't count. Just find a proxy, typically a parent, to handle the paperwork, and do all the rest of the work yourself.</li>
<li>Ukraine: there are currently restrictions that prevent many companies from doing business with Ukraine. Not sure how to work around it. You could try to incorporate somewhere else, if that's possible.</li>
</ol>
