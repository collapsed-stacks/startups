I am 14 years old student living in Ukraine. I have my own idea that I want to realise: run my own business and sell my product(s) worldwide. I want to create an accessory for iOS devices. I have experience as an iOS developer and worked with embedded computing development boards such as [Arduino][1] and [LaunchPad][2]. I want to use [Apple's HomeKit][3]. To developer iOS application for HomeKit-enabled
 accessory I only need [Apple Developer Program][4], which I have. But to develop HomeKit hardware, I need [Apple MFI license][5]. It is available only for officially registered companies and need validations. So my question is:

 1. Is there any official way to register company to a person with **NO** age of majority? If yes, how much does it cost and what is procedure of doing that?
 2. Is there any website like [Kickstarter][6] available in Ukraine and available for students?

You have two problems:

 1. Underage: in most places, anything you sign is void and doesn't count. Just find a proxy, typically a parent, to handle the paperwork, and do all the rest of the work yourself.
 2. Ukraine: there are currently restrictions that prevent many companies from doing business with Ukraine. Not sure how to work around it. You could try to incorporate somewhere else, if that's possible.
