I'm creating an app that can be used in bars and nightclubs. I'd like to do a publicity stunt where I pick a bar, and for everyone who has my app on their phone, I buy them a drink.

That may be unwise. It may be hard to figure out the logistics. But my current question is: **Is it legal in the United States for a company to buy an alcoholic drink for customers as a publicity stunt?**

Note that I'm not promoting a particular brand of alcohol, and I'm not promoting one bar or another. I'm just promoting my app that people will use in bars.

(I was going to ask this in the StackExchange "Law" community, but that community is described as "For legal professionals, students, and others with experience or interest in law." This is a marketing question for a startup.)

From the sounds of it you're not the one distributing the drink; the venue is.

You're merely picking up the tab. Make sure the venue sees to it that it's not selling alcohol to underage people (which, insofar as I can recollect, is often done at the entrance in California) and you should be fine.
