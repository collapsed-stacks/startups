<p>I am evaluating a prepaid card issuance project. This will be a VISA or MasterCard prepaid card. Among the things I need to estimate are the merchants this card will be able to work on.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/what-is-the-difference-between-a-prepaid-card-a-credit-card-and-a-debit-card-en-433/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">differences between prepaid, debit and credit cards</a> are pretty obvious from the <em>user's</em> point of view. As an user, there are <a href="https://www.securitybank.com/blog/credit-card-vs-debit-card-vs-prepaid-card-use/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pros and cons</a> for each one. Now, from the <em>merchant's</em> point of view: are there reasons to chose credit/debit over prepaid?</p>

<p>By accepting card payments, and not cash only, merchants expect either to sell more or to reach customers that wouldn't be available otherwise (think e-commerces, where cash is usually not an option.) Would there be reasons to accept credit cards, but to prevent users from paying with prepaid cards?</p>

<p>I've found the following reasons to reject prepaid cards, but I wonder if there are more:</p>

<ol>
<li>To avoid granting free access to <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/505" rel="nofollow noreferrer">paid-membership-only</a> privilleges,</li>
<li>To <a href="https://forum.foxycart.com/discussion/9220/prevent-pre-paid-visa-cards-with-stripe" rel="nofollow noreferrer">prevent fraud or theft when renting</a> expensive stuff,</li>
<li>If you have a <a href="https://www.paypal-community.com/t5/Bank-accounts-and-credit-cards/Using-a-prepaid-debit-or-credit-card/td-p/352496" rel="nofollow noreferrer">validation process to prevent fraud</a> but it wouldn't work out with this type of card</li>
<li>In the U.S., restaurants have a tendency to charge the tip when the user has left the store. Given that this extra charge can be declined if the card has not enough balance, <a href="https://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/31/will-more-restaurants-ban-the-use-of-prepaid-cards/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">some restaurants don't accept prepaid cards</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Are there any other differences? Do you know of certain transactions or operations that do not work with a prepaid card? Are there industries or merchant categories where accepting prepaid cards is a bad idea or unfeasible?</p>
