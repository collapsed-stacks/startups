<p>I've heard a few people talk about the benefits of issuing IOUs instead of shares when funding a startup. What does this actually look like? Is there a legal structure for doing this? How do IOUs work in the real world?</p>

<p>There aren't too many basic options in funding, but there are lots of variants. From the perspective of a funder, here are the principal questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Who gets my money?</strong> It could be an individual, an existing company, or an intermediary en route to one of those (e.g. Kickstarter acts as a trusted intermediary)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>What do I get?</strong> Leading choices are satisfaction for having helped, my money back (perhaps with interest), the first $X of any income, the right to buy shares in the future at some beneficial rate, voting shares, non-voting shares, the optional right to convert debt to shares</p></li>
<li><p><strong>What additional protections do I have?</strong> Perhaps if the venture fails, I own whatever's left</p></li>
<li><p><strong>What if it all goes wrong?</strong> For instance, a loan to a company disappears if the company ceases; a personal guarantee attached to that loan means that an individual has to make good</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I'd usually understand an IOU to be a person-to-person promise to pay back money loaned. So in the above framework, I give you the money; I get that money back from you at some future point; there are no special privileges; and if the venture goes wrong, you still owe me the money.</p>

<p>However, in the startup world sometimes what's going on with IOU-type paper agreements is a decision to delay making decisions on how shares are going to work and who's in and who's out until the venture is underway. That could be a good route for a startup that's nobody's day-job, although it could be a problem downstream if by the time you're ready to formalise, the interests of different parties have gone in different directions.</p>
