If an export invoice has "CIF" as its incoterm it means that the customer has to pay the cost of the product + insurance and freight.

My question is: can an invoice be "CIF" as a whole but the cost of the products be displayed as "FOB" ? 

eg: 

Here the 1200 boxes have a "FOB" price, but the invoice as a whole is "CIF":

     Quantity   Item                  Unit Price     Total Price
     -------------------------------------------------------------
      1200      Boxes of cherries        9.5         11400 <--- FOB
                Freight                               2000
                Insurance                             1000
     -------------------------------------------------------------
                                        Total CIF:   14400  

Here the 1200 boxes include the price of the freight and insurance, meaning that the price of the products is CIF and the invoice as a whole is also CIF:

     Quantity   Item                  Unit Price     Total Price
     -------------------------------------------------------------
      1200      Boxes of cherries        12          14400
     -------------------------------------------------------------
                                        Total CIF:   14400

Are both ways correct?

Is one of these two ways "more correct" ?
