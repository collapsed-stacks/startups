<p>If an export invoice has "CIF" as its incoterm it means that the customer has to pay the cost of the product + insurance and freight.</p>

<p>My question is: can an invoice be "CIF" as a whole but the cost of the products be displayed as "FOB" ? </p>

<p>eg: </p>

<p>Here the 1200 boxes have a "FOB" price, but the invoice as a whole is "CIF":</p>

<pre><code> Quantity   Item                  Unit Price     Total Price
 -------------------------------------------------------------
  1200      Boxes of cherries        9.5         11400 &lt;--- FOB
            Freight                               2000
            Insurance                             1000
 -------------------------------------------------------------
                                    Total CIF:   14400  
</code></pre>

<p>Here the 1200 boxes include the price of the freight and insurance, meaning that the price of the products is CIF and the invoice as a whole is also CIF:</p>

<pre><code> Quantity   Item                  Unit Price     Total Price
 -------------------------------------------------------------
  1200      Boxes of cherries        12          14400
 -------------------------------------------------------------
                                    Total CIF:   14400
</code></pre>

<p>Are both ways correct?</p>

<p>Is one of these two ways "more correct" ?</p>
