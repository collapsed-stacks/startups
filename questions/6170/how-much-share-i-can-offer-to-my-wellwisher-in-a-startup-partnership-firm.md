<p>I am going to start tech project and I want to run it as partnership firm including me and my well wisher as partners ( silent partner ) </p>

<p>I convinced him to provide cash worth of 1 Million(INR) as initial invest to run our business.  I want to offer him some share in my business but not able to figure exact "number"  to justify his contribution in kick off business and trusting my talent and business model.</p>

<p>Here is some of the points I considering before coming to exact number ..
1. The amount that he is offering is what it requires to run the business for first ONE YEAR.</p>

<p>After 1 Year I want to go for big investment , I already spoke to an angel investor who agreed to invest if my business shows positive signs after one year of operation.</p>

<p>So My Concern here is I should not offer too much shares to my well wisher so if Angel Investor comes in , I am not able to offer him his share equal to his big money.</p>

<p>at the same time , because my partner believed me and the first person to come forward to help me , I should offer him enough of shares to him so that he could benefit in case our business grow according to our estimation </p>

<p>. Here is our business projection ( little optimistic , thou it not impossible )  </p>

<ol>
<li>For One Year Our Development and Maintenance cost for running business 
<strong>2 M</strong> which is equal to first investors contribution </li>
<li>We need min of 5 M to kick of marketing and business operation so that we can generate revenues ( this amount will be coming from an angel investor)</li>
</ol>

<p>Keeping My share at 50 % ,</p>

<p>I am planning to offer 15 % to my well wisher ( first investor ) and 25% to an angel investor and 10 % reserve for future investor </p>

<p>Am I thinking right by offering 15 % to my first investor whose contribution is much smaller to an angel investor ??</p>
