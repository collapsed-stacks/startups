I have been using a certain product for quite a while. I have developed a service that will provide facilities to host this product. I have been using the product for very long, however I have little to no reputation in this community as I have not been actively participating in it earlier.

My question: what is the best way to enter a community and become reputable? One mistake can kinda ruin your whole reputation and therefore the service.

The goal is to become known so they will try out the service. I want to be friends with the kind of people who say "You should try out William's service if you wanna do that, he has ... because ...!"

How do I enter this community without them feeling 'intruded' or seeing what I want to achieve? (Build a reputation so I can market my product.)

I'm interested to hear your thoughts on this!

We are engaging in the same process that you are talking about. Our community is in the data analytics space. Things we are doing, that may work for you (but depending on your exact community)

 - blog around your subject of expertise
 - create a YouTube channel with relevant content - YouTube is the second most searched 'engine'
 - go to trade events as a speaker. Initially smaller events, but when you can demonstrate "thought leadership", then go for larger events
 - get involved in trade bodies, either as a volunteer or on the exec if possible
 - sponsor relevant events
 - enter relevant awards to your profession

For a professional community, I would volunteer, try to take a leadership position for an event, maybe write an article on how why the community is so important.
