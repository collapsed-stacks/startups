<p>1) Is there any legal problem if on a website all news will be transferred through RSS channels from other news portals? There will be a reference to the original text but it shows a full article.</p>

<p>2) People will be able to upload and edit someone's image and post it as a comment under some news. Will we be responsible for a comment which violates someone's intellectual property rights?</p>

<p>That's obvious copyright infringement.</p>

<p>You'll need to consult with a lawyer in your jurisdiction to find out if you can post verbatim headlines or excerpts. Generally speaking, the more systematic your system, the less rights you have to copyright exemptions like <em>fair use</em>.</p>

<p>Also, doing this will probably violate the source site's TOS with respect to using their RSS.</p>

<p>The best approach is to re-write the headlines in an original way and to write your own summaries (if necessary). Of course that's not as easy as just writing code that parses and republishes RSS.</p>

<p><strong>I am not an attorney. This is not legal advice.</strong></p>

<p>In the world of startups, many founders take the view that innovation in some spaces carries risks that need to be managed rather than avoided. You need to take your own view.</p>

<p>Having spent time with startups aggregating news feeds, my own view is that if you respect the conventions about use of those feeds, most particularly about ensuring that it's always simple for your users to navigate to the article source, then the intent demonstrated by the publisher's use of RSS gives you latitude to use the feed and innovate the added value.</p>

<p>By allowing your users to upload images and make comments, you are clearly at risk of unwittingly enabling copyright and other IP infringements, defamation, incitement and the rest. But I'm not sure this is distinctively different from, say, a blog that allows comments.</p>

<p>So if I were considering a venture like this, I think I would both look at some detail at the Ts &amp; Cs of other sites in similar fields, and make sure that I implemented a way for users to complain about content, because I don't believe that Ts &amp; Cs alone would cover my obligations.</p>
