<p>I have an idea that can help organisations specially the non-profit.</p>

<p>How Can I proceed? I am still doing my market research and running errands to improve the business modal.</p>

<p>Before I start contacting organisation, I will like to know what are the pointers I will need to know when dealing with non-profit organisation.</p>
