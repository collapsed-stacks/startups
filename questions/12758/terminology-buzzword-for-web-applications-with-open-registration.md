<p>I'm looking for one - ideally two - terms/buzzwords for software products.</p>

<p>How do you refer to web applications that allow users to choose a payment plan and register themselves <strong><em>versus</em></strong>  how do you call web applications that require an key account manager to setup an account for clients manually?</p>

<p>Any ideas? </p>

<p>I'd say the former is a <em>self-service</em> SaaS, whereas the latter is a <em>high-touch</em> or <em>enterprise</em> SaaS app.</p>

<p>1)  Keyless Registration</p>

<p>2)  Keyless Activation</p>

<p>Just depends what you want to emphasize.
If you are focusing on payment and licensing options, then "flex _____" or "your-choice ______".</p>

<p>Or,  "Get-it Your Way"</p>
