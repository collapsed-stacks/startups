Loans have to pay out interest but have a set duration. Say, you will pay $500 for 60 months at 10%. You know how much it will cost and can adjust to that.

Shares are forever and give their holders rights. This brings a whole set of additional issues. Are you willing to deal with any potential issues related to shareholders? Are you planning on paying a dividend soon?
