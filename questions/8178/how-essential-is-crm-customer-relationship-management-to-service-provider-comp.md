Currently I'm starting a Digital Marketing Agency and as I'm reading into many CRM's out there, I want to know how essential is CRM for companies who provide services to their customer (Campaigns Management, Creative services etc.).

###Questions:

 1. Again, how important is CRM for service provider companies?
 2. Which CRM is best out there that is Open-Source/Community version and provide powerful features?
 3. Which one offer client login to see their account information (Balance, documents etc.)?

I have used [**vTiger**][1], It's good and I like the interface, but very hard to manage the CRM when there is a problem to solve.

CRM software is incredibly important whether it is dedicated software or just a spreadsheet. The software that is best for you is dependent on hundreds of factors that are beyond the scope of this site. There are other sites dedicated to comparing the many options. A search for "show client their account information and balance in a crm (or the name of a crm you are considering)" will show not only how to do it but several applications that have this feature.

CRM is not limited to just for managing customer service, also helps to quickly automate key business functions – Sales, Marketing, Customer Support, Project Management, Invoicing and Reporting. All the feature give business performance indexes and forecast.
 
Good benefits of CRM comes from choosing right CRM for your business, if you own small or micro business then it's not a good idea to use a CRM with lots configuration. Pick something that fits your business. Try Insightly or Zoho for small business. But if you are looking CRM for micro business I would recommend Bizns Tool CRM (https://www.biznstool.com), it’s simple and no configuration required.
