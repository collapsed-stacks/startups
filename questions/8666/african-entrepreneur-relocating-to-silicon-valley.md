<p>I am a little curious here. I really want to know if an African Entrepreneur can relocate to the United State to start a tech company in Silicon Valley. What are the steps to be taken to achieve this?</p>

<p><strong>Narrow Down</strong></p>

<p>I am building an application. I am thinking if relocation can help my application become more acceptable worldwide, also if there will be easy accessibility to resources (funds, enabling environment etc). </p>
