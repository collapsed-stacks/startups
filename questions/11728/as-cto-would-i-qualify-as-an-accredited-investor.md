I don't meet the financial requirements as a accredited investor based on rule 501(a) under the 1933 Act, but as CTO would I qualify?

No. Everyone can call themselfs CTO by registering a firm. Without more information thats just a name.

Edit: Someone downvoted this answer, I don't know why, but I'll just add some prove to my answer:

http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=&SID=8edfd12967d69c024485029d968ee737&r=SECTION&n=17y3.0.1.1.12.0.46.176

There it clearly says who counts as accredited investor. 

>Any director, executive officer, or general partner of the issuer of the securities being offered or sold, or any director, executive officer, or general partner of a general partner of that issuer;

So if you are the CTO of the company you want to buy, maybe. But the rest stays valid, I could register a firm right now and call myself founder, CTO, CEO, Chief executive technical supder officer and whatever I want to.
If you are CTO of a big enough firm, you have the necessary net worth. Else, you don't classify.
