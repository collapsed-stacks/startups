I once read (sorry, can't recall where) that by incorporating, you avoid "paying the income tax twice", but I'm not quite sure what that means.

How does incorporating a sole proprietorship reduce taxes? Is it different for different income levels (e.g. below vs. above $30k)?

Note: the question is *not* about the merits of registering a corporation in general (like limited liability, etc.), but specifically about the tax reduction, if any.

In Canada a Sole Proprietorship pays no taxes - just the proprietor  and doesn't really count as a corporation. However an incorporated company does pay corporate taxes and then the directors/share holders pay taxes on any dividends etc. 

So in summary incorporating doesn't *exactly* mean you pay twice but you do have to do twice the paperwork and there is *some* duplication of taxes. There are no tax benefits for a small company to incorporate. There are liability and other benefits as you mentioned but for taxes if anything it is a detriment.
