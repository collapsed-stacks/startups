<p>I once read (sorry, can't recall where) that by incorporating, you avoid "paying the income tax twice", but I'm not quite sure what that means.</p>

<p>How does incorporating a sole proprietorship reduce taxes? Is it different for different income levels (e.g. below vs. above $30k)?</p>

<p>Note: the question is <em>not</em> about the merits of registering a corporation in general (like limited liability, etc.), but specifically about the tax reduction, if any.</p>

<p>In Canada a Sole Proprietorship pays no taxes - just the proprietor  and doesn't really count as a corporation. However an incorporated company does pay corporate taxes and then the directors/share holders pay taxes on any dividends etc. </p>

<p>So in summary incorporating doesn't <em>exactly</em> mean you pay twice but you do have to do twice the paperwork and there is <em>some</em> duplication of taxes. There are no tax benefits for a small company to incorporate. There are liability and other benefits as you mentioned but for taxes if anything it is a detriment.</p>
