<p>I'm planning on set up a freelance business in web design and development when I move to Australia next year and I'm creating an invoice system for my finances.</p>

<p>However, I'm struggling a little over VAT/GST and when to charge it.</p>

<p>I read <a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/GST/How-GST-works/" rel="nofollow">this article</a> about how it works, but I don't quite understand when or how to charge clients in and outside of Australia. As far as I'm aware, <a href="http://www.kpmg.com/global/en/issuesandinsights/articlespublications/vat-gst-essentials/pages/australia.aspx#1" rel="nofollow">I charge 10% to clients inside of Australia</a>, but how does it work when the client is outside of Australia? I seem to be unable to find anything about that.</p>

<p><strong>[EDIT 11th dec. 2014]</strong></p>

<p>I found <a href="http://www.startupsmart.com.au/mentor/robert-krigsman/do-i-charge-my-overseas-clients-gst-on-consulting-services.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> article on GST which states that basically if you provide a service outside of Australia if said service's <em>"effective use or enjoyment must occur outside Australia"</em>, it's <em>"not for work performed on any tangible personal property based in Australia"</em>, that it's <em>"not connected with real property in Australia"</em>, and that the client is not inside of Australia when the service is performed, that it falls under GST-Free.  </p>

<p>To me, this indicates that clients outside of Australia are not charged GST.</p>

<p>However, it also says this:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To arrive at an accurate and more definitive conclusion, I would recommend seeking a specific transactional review by a qualified tax professional.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I also found <a href="http://www.rmit.edu.au/browse/Staff%2FAdministration%2FPolicies%20and%20procedures%2FFinance%20and%20procurement%2FTaxation%2FExports%20-%20GST%20fact%20sheet%2010/" rel="nofollow">this article on the site of RMIT</a> which states the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Services exported by RMIT for consumption outside Australia will be GST-free in the following cases:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>The services relate to goods or real estate outside Australia, eg. If as part of an architecture course at RMIT, a student must design a building for a company or individual, and the student designs one for a non-resident, and the building is to be constructed in another country, his fee will be GST-free.</li>
  <li>Services are provided to a non-resident who is not in Australia at that time.</li>
  <li>Services provided to someone who is not in Australia, and the services are used outside Australia (cannot be directly related to goods or real property in Australia).</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>This also indicated to me that providing services to anyone who is outside of Australia at that time is not charged GST.</p>

<p>Based on your edit, it works much like VAT in the EU:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If your client is in Australia, collect GST.</p></li>
<li><p>If your client is anywhere else, don't collect GST.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The EU has a few <a href="https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/1299/is-there-a-vat-threshold-for-digital-goods-sold-to-eu-buyers-from-a-us-company/3259#3259">peculiarities with respect to the second point</a> that you need to be aware of in the event you have European clients -- namely, you're also supposed to collect VAT (yes!) on behalf of the country your EU clients operate in.</p>
