Networking in local events is probably a good start - conferences, meetups and such. Try IPExpo near your location. I do recommend you continue with Linkedin and similar sites as well. Perhaps, look for and join a Slack community directly related to what you are doing.

It might be that you need to work a bit more on how you reach out to these people, polish your "pitch" so to say.
