You can find paid beta testers from following resources :

1 - From Freelancing sites [i.e upwork.com]

2 - http://www.utest.com/ [Here you will get lot of testers]

3 - http://thesoftwaretesting.com/ [Provides very good testing services]

Above are resources with which I have experience and worked with them for all type of testing work, so suggesting you.

There are many technology blogs that are in need of great stories. They have to find and pitch new technology to survive. You will be doing them a huge favor by writing an article about yourself and sending it to them as a news tip.

Read TechCrunch and Tech.co for examples of the writing style they are looking for. Don't worry about pitching to TechCrunch, though. Even if they did pick up your story you would get more hits than you could handle. Go for some of the smaller sites especially if you can find on that covers your niche.

If you are looking for beta-testers to check for bug's and issues in your site, you can find those in several places.

However, if you are looking for someone to test the quality of your product, than look no further than your initial customers. No one will be able to give you better feedback on your solution than them.
