When applying for business licenses do you need to get a license in every county/city you do business even without physical locations. My business is only a service business and would have no physical presence in other counties and cities... Do I still need to pay their licenses?

No.

However if you have customers in the European Union you have to be aware of the VAT compliance rules.

The gist of the issue is that the tax on your product should go to the country you sold your service or product to. 

Majority of businesses still ignore this rule as it is very hard for the EU to go after companies outside of their borders.
