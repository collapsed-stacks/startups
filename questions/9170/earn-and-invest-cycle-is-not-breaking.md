Last year we have founded a startup. We all expert level programmers.

When we started startup, we thought that we will do couple of outsourced projects for other company and will get some initial amount. And based on that income, we will invest for good marketing person/people who can get us good projects for Website And Mobile Apps development for our company.

But the first plan didnt worked out very well. So now we are not in position to hire marketing person, but as we are not able to hire, we are not earning as well.

What can be done in this case

Well , learn that these experiences can always enrich you . In this case , you learned that not always get the first shot. Use this to your advantage . Rearrange the strategy , review no business plan, and try cheaper marketing alternatives. ( Facebook ads , for example)

Anything. available :)
