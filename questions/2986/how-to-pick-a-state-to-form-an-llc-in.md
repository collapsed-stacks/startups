I've asked this on money.stackexchange.com, but this site might be better suited.

I'm looking to form a web based company with a friend of mine. I'm living in Colorado and he's living in Oklahoma. We want to start up a website that offers a digital service and we want it formed under an LLC. For both of us, this is our first time doing anything more than our taxes.

I found one question about forming an LLC out of state and I've read several pages online that describe the general process. But how do I make a decision about some of the specifics? How do I pick a state and if I don't know anybody in that state how do I find an "agent" in that state?

I've found several sites that are willing to do most of the work for me if I pay, but I know that they want me to pay for stuff I don't want or don't have to pay for like $80 to get an Employer ID from the IRS.

Once I pick a state, I think we'll be able to collect our thoughts and begin down that road. But what factors do I need to look for when picking a state?

<p>Generally, you pick the State which you're located at, because you'll have to register your LLC there in any case. In your case that would be either Colorado or Oklahoma - register as domestic in one, as foreign in the other.</p>

<p>If your concern is anything other than mere convenience/costs - then you need to talk to a lawyer, however most State LLC laws are fairly alike (and modeled after the <a href="http://www.uniformlaws.org/shared/docs/limited%20liability%20company/ullca_final_06rev.pdf" rel="nofollow">"Uniform Limited Liability Company Act"</a>.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that most of the sites talking about "forming LLC out of state" are either sales sites or targeted to foreigners attempting to form a US company. All the cr@p you hear about forming in Delaware/Nevada/Wyoming - is useless and worthless for someone who's a resident of any of the US States. If you're a US resident - you will <strong>always</strong> have to register in the State you're located at and do the work at, so if you register elsewhere - you just need to register <em>again</em> in your home State. In your case you already span across States, so you'll have to register in two States as it is - why add the costs of registering in a third one?</p>
