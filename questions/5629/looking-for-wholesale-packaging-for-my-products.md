<p>I'm not sure of the exact configuration you are looking for, but you might find something close to what you want at industrial packaging suppliers like <a href="http://www.uline.com/" rel="nofollow">Uline</a> or <a href="https://www.swalter.com/" rel="nofollow">S.Walter</a>.</p>

<p>It might help to give some more details - size? weight? food? electronics? Those will all affect the packaging you need.</p>

<p>Finally ... you can always see what's available in large quantities for cheap prices at the infamous Alibaba, even if you don't want to purchase through them.</p>
