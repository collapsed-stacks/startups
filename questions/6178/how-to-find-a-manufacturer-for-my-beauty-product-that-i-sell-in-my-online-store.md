<p>I am thinking about starting an online store selling my homemade hair pomade (wax). I know how to create a website but I can't find a supplier (sorry if this is the wrong word) who will make my product and ship it. </p>

<p>It is simple to make and you can buy all the ingredients off of Amazon. I make it myself for my own hair but I don't have the time to make all of the wax to sell so I need to find a supplier (sorry again if this is the wrong word). </p>

<p>Does anyone know of a supplier who would create my product?</p>

<p>Ps. It is cooked on a double boiler and takes about 5 minutes to make.</p>

<p>You have the right word. But the correct way to find such a company isn't to ask in a forum. It is to use Google and pick up your telephone when you find promising looking companies. Really.</p>

<p>That said, and as point out by @Frisbee, get the order first. It'll solve 95% of your problems. You'll probably not find a supplier who is willing to work with too small fry. If it's really 5 minutes to make per unit, spend a week making some. Then try to sell them before worrying about whether anyone will build it for you. Worst case scenario if you sell your stock: hire someone.</p>

<p>Also, keep in mind that a <a href="https://cooking.stackexchange.com/q/9451">health inspector</a> might show up at your door at some point. Not saying that you should run some full-blown clinical test or anything. But do consider safety, check with a chemist or two, and document yourself before proceeding. Combining ingredients can sometimes yield <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=guncotton" rel="nofollow noreferrer">surprising results</a>.</p>
