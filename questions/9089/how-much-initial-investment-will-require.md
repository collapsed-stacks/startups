<p>Based solely on the vague information you have provided, an accurate estimation cannot be given; however, here is my advice:</p>

<p>As with most startups, before the "initial investment" is many hours of your own time refining your plan of action. Take the time to flush out ideas and try to determine your overall vision and how you plan to achieve your goals.</p>

<p>Once you have a solid direction of where you want to take your idea, you should talk with someone that has experience with project management that can help you clearly define your feature set and get an estimation of scope of work to deliver a prototype / minimum viable product. Only through this process will you get an idea of how much initial investment this will require.</p>

<li><p>For such a minor thing -  a social network - it should cost no more than a months wages for a single developer.</p></li>
<li><p>That is a pretty good place to start if you have access to school mailing lists, because those are really free marketing. However, being in India, it will be significantly harder to get venture capital. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>In conclusion it may take a few thousand dollars to develop the app, but the main problem is getting investors attention so you can grow. </p>
