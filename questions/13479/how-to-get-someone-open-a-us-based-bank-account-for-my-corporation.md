I just incorporated a joint stock corporation in Canada. It's not active yet, so it's an empty shell right now. I really need a US-based bank account for this corporation but I can't travel to the USA to open the bank account myself or sign the papers.

My question is: I have a friend located in the USA who works for my business part-time. Is there a way to give specific powers to this person so he is able to open the bank account in a US bank for me? Which powers would I need to give him in the Corporation?

As the corporation is currently an empty shell, I suppose there is no risk if I just revoke his powers after this, or ask him to sign a pre-filled resignation letter? I'm currently the only person registered with this business.

I'm also open to suggestions, I suppose there are some professional services who offer to open US bank accounts for a corporation, but i haven't found any that doesn't ask me to physically travel to the USA :(

Thanks!

Insofar as I'm aware this is no longer possible - or not at all easily - since the aftermath of 2001. To get a US bank account you need to live there or have a business that's actually registered there.

What you _can_ do is open a USD account with a Canadian bank for your Canadian business. Just about any bank should be able to offer this - just ask.
