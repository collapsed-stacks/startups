I started an online tool to help online shops increase their revenue from instagram. Basically I made a clone of www.have2have.it in my mother tongue. 

Since it is a new thing in my country I decided to keep it free for a few months.

As it is a new tool I had to contact shop owners to introduce my website. I composed a message and explained what my website does and sent it to 40 shop owners, 2 of them blocked me, one of them signed up and the rest of them just ignored my message.

What should I do to persuade them to try my online services?

As a straight campaign, that was great learning and not a bad result: you got a customer! Not so great that you got more blocks - that's telling you that your message needs refining.

But is this the way forward? At the start, your concern is, **can customers find value in your offering?** Here's what I'd do.

I'd take 10 of the non-responders and offer to do all the work for them. And I'd take another 10 and do the work - set up the site - then show them. My target would be to get at least one new customer from each group, and to get at least another handful who might not have signed up, but who were up for a conversation.

All being well, now I would get the stories from the customers, stories that show them getting value. Those stories would be at the heart of my next campaign.

Good luck! You're disappointed, but you shouldn't be. Persist, invest and learn. Success will come, because you care about your customers and want to bring them success you know has followed in other markets.
