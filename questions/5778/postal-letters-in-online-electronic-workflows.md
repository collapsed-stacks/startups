Most of our enterprise communication happens electronically via email or chat, but sometimes we receive postal letters or are required to send one. Incoming letters are currently filed and, if necessary, copied and distributed. Outgoing letters are printed twice such that one physical copy remains in our files. This workflow appears somewhat traditional.

Is there an online service that helps integrating letters into an otherwise electronic workflow, e.g., via scanning the pages and organizing them in some sort of thread structure?
