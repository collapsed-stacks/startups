I want to launch a new product and I have bought two domain names knowing that "ProductName.com" is taken but not used.

I have registered the following:
GetProductName.com
ProductName.org

The product is a SaaS app for businesses. So basically a for profit product.

My question is, which domain name would be better to go with? GetProductName.com or ProductName.org?

Thanks

I'd use the .com name. 

.org names are generally used for non-profits and it will look strange building a commercial product that way.

<p>If you're selling a tangible product (like an app or some software) then I'd suggest <a href="http://google.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer">getproduct.com</a>. For example, <a href="http://getzephyr.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer">getzephyr.com</a> - the user's going to the website to get something. </p>

<p>If you're selling a service then, to mimic jeremyrandall's, I would steer clear of a .org domain.</p>

<p>Have you considered a new top level domain like <a href="http://www.go.co/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">.co</a>? It's clean, usually available and is quickly becoming a 'recognised' extension. </p>
