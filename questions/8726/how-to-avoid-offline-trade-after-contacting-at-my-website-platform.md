My website is a platform on education, and it can help teachers to get a lot of students to teach and earn money. But, many teachers got the resources on my website but did not order online because my website would leave 10% money for commercialization. How can I avoid this?

There are a few ideas you could look at improving engagement. I guess the general principle is to try and offer something that is compelling that they cant do without.

 - The 'freemium' model, where upon signup, which is free, a user gains access to a certain 'low value' but worthwhile content. Then you will have one or more tiers with various levels of paid content.
 - Discounting your content for a period of time, to try and gain some customer following
 - Using a monthly automatic billing of a small amount, much like the way Microsoft does with Office 365.
 - Offer content that others don't. Either by the depth of information or the diversity.
 - Can you make it difficult for people to get resources off your website if they aren't a paid subscriber?
 - Can you make the community aspect of the website a key thing. Have a look at mathletics.co.uk, as the community aspect of online competition is very compelling to lots of kids. They have a very strong worldwide presence, from a company based in Australia, I think.
 - Establish yourself as a 'thought leader' in your area, which will draw customers to you.

I would pose a few questions to you, in order to get you thinking around your business model. 

 - It is possible your price point is just too high?
 - What are your competitors charging?
 - Are the resources you are selling already offered free?
 - Why would someone want your service over another similar service?
 - Is there a way to differentiate your product in some way, so that there will be no better choice for your customers?
 - Are you a premium service or commodity service? Does your pricing structure reflect this?
 - What is your marketing strategy, who are you trying to attract :- students, tutors, teachers or schools?
 - Who pays for the service? (same list as above)
