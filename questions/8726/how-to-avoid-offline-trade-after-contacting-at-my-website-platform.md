<p>My website is a platform on education, and it can help teachers to get a lot of students to teach and earn money. But, many teachers got the resources on my website but did not order online because my website would leave 10% money for commercialization. How can I avoid this?</p>

<p>There are a few ideas you could look at improving engagement. I guess the general principle is to try and offer something that is compelling that they cant do without.</p>

<ul>
<li>The 'freemium' model, where upon signup, which is free, a user gains access to a certain 'low value' but worthwhile content. Then you will have one or more tiers with various levels of paid content.</li>
<li>Discounting your content for a period of time, to try and gain some customer following</li>
<li>Using a monthly automatic billing of a small amount, much like the way Microsoft does with Office 365.</li>
<li>Offer content that others don't. Either by the depth of information or the diversity.</li>
<li>Can you make it difficult for people to get resources off your website if they aren't a paid subscriber?</li>
<li>Can you make the community aspect of the website a key thing. Have a look at mathletics.co.uk, as the community aspect of online competition is very compelling to lots of kids. They have a very strong worldwide presence, from a company based in Australia, I think.</li>
<li>Establish yourself as a 'thought leader' in your area, which will draw customers to you.</li>
</ul>

<p>I would pose a few questions to you, in order to get you thinking around your business model. </p>

<ul>
<li>It is possible your price point is just too high?</li>
<li>What are your competitors charging?</li>
<li>Are the resources you are selling already offered free?</li>
<li>Why would someone want your service over another similar service?</li>
<li>Is there a way to differentiate your product in some way, so that there will be no better choice for your customers?</li>
<li>Are you a premium service or commodity service? Does your pricing structure reflect this?</li>
<li>What is your marketing strategy, who are you trying to attract :- students, tutors, teachers or schools?</li>
<li>Who pays for the service? (same list as above)</li>
</ul>
