I failed. I'm broke. I'm in debt up to my eyeballs. It's over. The thought of going back to the madhouse that is the workforce makes me sick; but I can see no other alternative. Do I have any other options?

1. Take some time off.

2. Remember that filing for personal bankruptcy is an option in the US (except for special cases like student debt).

3. "the madhouse that is the workforce makes me sick" makes it sounds like you're completely burnt out and won't be able to do much for a while. (Go see a shrimp if appropriate.)

4. Really take some time off for a bit.

I am sorry about your current situation. However I have some advice. You are an entrepreneur for a reason, because you believe in yourself and what you do. All entrepreneurs will fail and that is okay. You just need to organize your thought, learn a new skill, and as an entrepreneur start a business with it. I suggest you try to learn a web app development framework. It costs zero dollars to learn them, read tutorials or watch on youtube, get business cards for under 20 dollars and pass them out to people. You can advertise for free on social media. It will literally cost you almost 20 to start a new business if you already have a computer. 
Check out django python to start of if you decide to. Good luck!
