I'm creating an online service that does something like the following:

1- A group of users create something called a "deal".

2- They discuss the deal between each other and set a price for the deal.

3- Once they all agree on the deal, then they want to pay for it.

4- My website should collect the money from each person and then send it to the user who is responsible for executing the deal.

5- My website charge nothing for that service. In other words, my website just facilitate setting the price, collecting the money, and then sending it to the right person.

My question/problem:

1- How can I collect the money from their bank accounts and then do the money transfer without any fees? Since I'm not making any profit from that, then I want to keep it completely free. However, when I checked paypal's merchant's account, they seem to charge very high fees! So for every 1000, they charge 44 something! Which is too much! Any idea how can I overcome this?
