<p>I have a small food company in Thailand, it is a very small business, but the potential is huge, IF I get FDA.</p>

<p>In order to do that I need money for small factory and production licence. This business is VERY hands down and there is nothing nebulous about it.</p>

<p>I have ideas on how to market it also, including putting my face on the product, a first for a westerner to do that in Thailand.</p>

<p>How can I stop investors to simply copy my ideas, open their own factory and do it?</p>

<p>The company in question is <a href="http://www.satearn.com" rel="nofollow">www.satearn.com</a></p>

<p>If you have the experience and other qualifications to make you the best person to do this idea, why wouldn't they want to invest in you? If they wanted to do it on their own they would have to hire someone to head it up. You are probably the one they would want hire for your experience. By investing in you they are essentially hiring you.</p>

<p>That said, you can patent any unique processes or tools invented by you to use in your factory. You can also trademark your business name, logo, (possibly) slogan/tagline, and brand names as soon as they are shown on your website or on products.</p>
