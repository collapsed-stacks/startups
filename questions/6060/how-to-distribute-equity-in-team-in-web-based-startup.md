We are 4 guys in grad school. We are coders. I have an idea for a web based startup. So before starting the startup I want to distribute equity. **I don't want 4 co-founders as too many cooks spoil the food**. So I'll choose one of them to be co-founder.

So I have made two cases.

**CASE 1.**

Me(Founder/CEO)- 60%

B(Co-founder) - 20%

C- 10%

D- 10%

**CASE 2.**

Me(Founder/CEO)- 50%

B(Co-founder) - 50%

C- ?

D- ?

Case 1 seems unfair. But I'll provide working space. And I will invest in web technologies like domain, hosting (as we are not going to produce any physical good). And top of all. This is my idea.

Case 2 is good to prevent any conflicts with co-founder in future but what about C and D. I can't pay them as we are in grad school.

And another question should I made them to sign NDA and equity paper before starting?

  <p>TLDR: If you have equal shares, you did it wrong.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are two schools of thought on this, the 50/50 one being the more popular one. However I suggest you read <em>Dan Shapiro</em>'s <a href="http://www.geekwire.com/2011/wrong-answer-5050-calculating-cofounder-equity-split/" rel="nofollow">take on this</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The only wrong answer is 50/50: Calculating the co-founder equity split</strong></p>
  
  <p>The question of equity brings out the most fundamental differences,
  perceptions, and values in an aspiring startup. In fact the equity
  question, more than any other, may strangle a young company before it
  can even get started. And that’s a damn good thing.</p>
  
  <p>But before we get in to that…</p>
  
  <p><strong>Who’s a founder?</strong></p>
  
  <p>As straightforward as this question sounds, it’s a tricky matter. The
  founder moniker is black and white, but the situations are all shades
  of gray. Setting aside the philosophical question and focusing on the
  more useful economic one, though, there is a simple approach: founders
  are people who take a very particular kind of risk.</p>
  
  <p>There are, quite roughly, three stages in every company’s life:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li><p>Founding.  The only money the company has is what you put in.  You are getting no money out of the company.  The company will probably
  fail, and you will lose all the money you put in, plus the lost
  salary, plus you have to find a new job.</p></li>
  <li><p>Startup. The company has money, either from investors or from revenue, and they give you some of that money every month. Your salary
  is less than what you’d get at a big company. 50/50 the company fails
  and you have to find a new job, plus you’ve lost the difference
  between your startup salary and the BigCo salary.</p></li>
  <li><p>Real company. You get “market” salary. It’s unlikely the company fails, and if it does, your downside is limited to unemployment.</p></li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>The rule is this: if you’re working for a company that’s so young it
  can’t pay you, you’re a founder. If you are drawing a salary on your
  first day at work, you’re not.</p>
  
  <p><strong>What’s a founder worth?</strong></p>
  
  <p>A founder is defined by the inability of their company to pay them (or
  anyone else) for anything. A founder’s primary job, then, is to get
  their company some money – either by raising investment or by
  generating revenue. So a founder is valued by two things:</p>
  
  <p>1) Their contribution</p>
  
  <p>2) The market</p>
  
  <p>The first of these is fair. The second is economics. Both are
  essential.</p>
  
  <p><strong>And now, the formula</strong></p>
  
  <p>Of course, there can be no right answer – but this one’s not so
  terribly wrong. To start out with, give every founder 100 shares. Some
  startups are born running, with all founders on board from the
  beginning.</p>
  
  <p>But others come from one leader who recruits the others. You may or
  may not take the CEO title, but if you’re the one who rounded up the
  co-founders and talked everyone in to getting things done, add 5
  percent to your holdings.  If you were previously 100/100/100, you’re
  now 105/100/100.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Ideas are precious, but dwarfed by execution (5%)</strong></p>
  
  <p>It’s a lie to say that ideas are worthless and execution is
  everything… but it’s not too far from the truth, either. If you’re the
  founder who brought the original concept to the table, increase your
  share holdings by 5 percent (so if you had 105 before, you now have
  110.25) Note that if the idea is implemented, or patented, or otherwise has some execution behind it, then…</p>
  
  <p><strong>The first step is the hardest (5%-25%)</strong></p>
  
  <p>Creating a difficult-to-replicate beachhead can give a fledgling
  company direction and credibility. It can help with revenue and with
  financing. If you bring a concrete start to the table – a critical,
  filed patent (not a provisional), a compelling demo, an early version
  of the product that isn’t quite there yet, or something else that
  means much of the work towards financing or revenue is already done –
  you get a boost of 5 percent to 25 percent. The key variation here is,
  “How much closer does this get us to revenue or financing?”</p>
  
  <p><strong>CEO gets more (5%)</strong></p>
  
  <p>Here’s a common situation: the split is 50/50 so that neither party
  controls the company.</p>
  
  <p>Well, if you don’t trust your CEO with the majority of shares, you’re
  founding the company with the wrong person. Market rate for a great
  CEO is higher than market rate for a great CTO, so the CEO job gets a
  bit more equity. This isn’t fair – the work isn’t easier or anything –
  but it does reflect some market realities.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Fulltime commitment is expensive (200%)</strong></p>
  
  <p>If you’re working fulltime while your co-founders are working part
  time, you’re the pig. You’re working more, and you’re risking a lot
  more if the project fails.</p>
  
  <p>Furthermore, part-time cofounders are a big minus to someone
  considering an investment. Their equivocating will be expensive. Add
  200 percent to the shareholdings of all the fulltimers.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Reputation is the most precious asset of all</strong></p>
  
  <p>If your goal is to get investment, some people make that much easier.
  If you’re a first-time entrepreneur partnering with someone who’s
  successfully raised VC dollars, that person is a lot more investable
  than you are.</p>
  
  <p>In the extreme, some entrepreneurs are so “investable” that their
  involvement is a guarantee of raising funds. (It’s easy to identify
  them: Ask the investors who know them best “would you back them no
  matter what they do?”  If the answer is “yes”, then they are that kind
  of super.)</p>
  
  <p>These super-preneurs essentially remove all the risk of the “founding”
  stage, so you should expect that they get the lion’s share of the
  equity from this stage.</p>
  
  <p>This point doesn’t apply to most founding teams, but when it does,
  expect the super-preneur to take 50 percent to 500 percent or more,
  depending on just how much more significant their reputation is than
  their cofounders.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Treat cash like an investment</strong></p>
  
  <p>Ideally, each investor contributes an equal amount to the company. 
  That, plus their labor, earns them their “founder shares.”</p>
  
  <p>It’s possible, though, that one founder may put in significantly more.
  The price for that is high, since it’s the earliest, riskiest
  investment.  That founder will get more equity; to determine how much,
  talk to a good startup attorney about a reasonable value for your
  company and work from there.</p>
  
  <p>For example, they might say that your company could reasonably be
  valued at $450,000 for investment purposes, so a $50,000 investment
  would merit an additional 10 percent.</p>
  
  <p>There are more structured ways to do this, ranging from revolving
  credit lines with interest and warrants to convertible debt that
  converts in to common shares. But these all mean increased legal bills
  and, more importantly, complex cap tables – something that can scare
  off outside investment.</p>
  
  <p><strong>The final accounting</strong></p>
  
  <p>At this point, you’ll have something like 200/150/250. Just add up the
  shares (600, in this example) and divide each person’s holdings by
  that number to get their ownership: 33 percent, 25 percent, 42
  percent.</p>
  
  <p><strong>50/50 isn’t a business decision, it’s a compromise</strong></p>
  
  <p>You need to get used to hard questions. You need to get used to
  trusting each other. You need to get used to the idea that you’re not
  all equal.  You need to have the difficult discussions about
  responsibilities, contributions, roles, and compensation.  You need to
  do  it before you make commitments to investors and employees.</p>
  
  <p>And if you find that the only way you can get a decision made is by
  compromising – then you need to stop now, before the price of failure
  climbs higher.</p>
  
  <p>There’s no way around it. You’re going to have to split the baby, but
  it doesn’t require the wisdom of Solomon to get it right.</p>
  
  <p>Take your time, keep a level head, and remember: this is just the
  first of the decisions you’ll be making together for the rest of your
  company’s life!</p>
