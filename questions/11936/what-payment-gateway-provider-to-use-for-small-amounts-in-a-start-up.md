<p>We are setting up a small online project which will have a monthly subscription. The amounts are quite small 2-5$ US dollars or so but the company is not based in the USA. It's based in Bulgaria, country in Eastern Europe. What would be the best payment gateway provider to use in this case?</p>

<p>There are two main concerns - their service should allow our company to register and use them (which for example is not an option with PayPal) and the taxes and fees for such small transaction amounts should be as small as possible. Any suggestions?</p>
