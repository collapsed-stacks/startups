I am working remotely with my client with whom I have work relation for the last 4 years.

While working on different personal stuff for my client - I realised that certain problem is really common for the people there so I did some market research online and found that a certain saas based software would work well there 

I put that idea to my client and he was willing to give it a try (ofcourse believing that it would sell)

The problem is, usually I see startups here struggling making their startup by doing lots of stuff like attending different sessions, joining incubation centres, doing hackathons etc which makes me think that maybe we are doing it the wrong way 

We are just developing the tool and doing some social media

Intend to have closed beta and ask some people to test them and let us improve it on their feedback, have a good support to make it easier for people who joins, doing marketing online with adwords, guest articles, banners offline, Social media campaigns, retargeting market etc

But still it seems lacking like we are not doing enough or we wouldn't be able to provide something which sells

Do you think the way I approached this is ok? How can I improve it and fixes or recognise the mistakes I do? Should I be there myself to help my client or just let him know what we need is enough?

If I understand you correctly, then you are a programmer who has an app in the development process. You want to know if the programme shall sell or not. There are millions of patents in the world that never commercialised. The benefit of joining an incubator is that you learn the commercial aspect of your innovation. I suggest you finish your software development and then take a SAAS marketer on board. If your app has potential, then a marketer shall be interested to work with you. If it has no potential, then you shall see marketers are not interested to progress further with you.
