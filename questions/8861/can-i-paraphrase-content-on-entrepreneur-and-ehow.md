I am about to write a blog for my website. And the contents on Entrepreneur and eHow are most suited on my site. Is it okay if I paraphrase and rewrite the contents on Entrepreneur to my language with giving them credits?

When you say "paraphrase" you imply giving the original source/author credit for the text, true?

If true - and so long as you are not implying you have a special relationship with either, then I think you should be fine (I'm not a lawyer - so maybe its best you raise the question in the law exchange).

Areas of 'discomfort' that I have is if the text was to describe a product or service which in itself could imply to the reader that you had some special relationship or endorsement or otherwise. I would suggest you make your relationship with the product/service clear between the heading and the text (thus, not a footnote where folk might not read, but somewhere noticable). State if you are a customer, client, partner, if you have a vested interested like shareholding etc
