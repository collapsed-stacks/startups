## How to sell via a retail store?

My background is in B2B software (mostly IT security), but I've created a B2C product and have NO idea how to push it.

(I'm going to try not peddle the product while explaining my problem)

I have a software product for non-tech users, who do risky things.  In this case, anti-malware, anti-ransomeware, anti-zero day attack.

Since my target is low-tech computer users, I figured I would go AARP/AMAC and/or porn users.  Parents would be good too... but I needed to choose one.

I'm thinking porn users.  They are willingly doing risky things.

I figure I'd hit up the local market (Houston) and sell my device/subscription there.

 **How do I do this?**

I'm guessing that I need some sort of 'Display' to promote the product and an attractive offer to the the vendor.

In my case, the product is a USB stick where 'protection' is provided, for X days, then a subscription is required.

**Question**

What does the Retail Vendor expect?

 - a discount on the price?  (I'm guessing 20%) 
 - How would a percentage of the subscription play? (I'm guessing not well)

Any advice is welcomed.
