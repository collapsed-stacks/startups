<p>My background is in B2B software (mostly IT security), but I've created a B2C product and have NO idea how to push it.</p>

<p>(I'm going to try not peddle the product while explaining my problem)</p>

<p>I have a software product for non-tech users, who do risky things.  In this case, anti-malware, anti-ransomeware, anti-zero day attack.</p>

<p>Since my target is low-tech computer users, I figured I would go AARP/AMAC and/or porn users.  Parents would be good too... but I needed to choose one.</p>

<p>I'm thinking porn users.  They are willingly doing risky things.</p>

<p>I figure I'd hit up the local market (Houston) and sell my device/subscription there.</p>

<p><strong>How do I do this?</strong></p>

<p>I'm guessing that I need some sort of 'Display' to promote the product and an attractive offer to the the vendor.</p>

<p>In my case, the product is a USB stick where 'protection' is provided, for X days, then a subscription is required.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>What does the Retail Vendor expect?</p>

<ul>
<li>a discount on the price?  (I'm guessing 20%) </li>
<li>How would a percentage of the subscription play? (I'm guessing not well)</li>
</ul>

<p>Any advice is welcomed. </p>
