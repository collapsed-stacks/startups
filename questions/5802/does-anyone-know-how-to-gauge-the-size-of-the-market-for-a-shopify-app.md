<p>I've got an idea for an app on the Shopify marketplace, but before I take the plunge and build it I'd like to know from anyone who has made there own app if there any ways to gauge the possible market for it to make a business case.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.shopify.com/blog/13838985-100-000-stores-now-use-shopify" rel="nofollow">this</a> Shopify announcement they say they reached 100k customers. However this was over a year ago, so I would say they have even more. </p>

<p>You can use this figure as a base for the size of the market.</p>
