<p>I want to launch an app which I think is a great idea. I've thought of an obvious name for it depending the main use of the app. Should I launch the app without getting the domain name? or should I use other name for my app. Planning to launch the app on all measure platforms.</p>

<p>I got almost everything but just not the domain name.</p>

<p>There's more to domain names than [appname].com. Among the other "generally acceptable" domains type options, try:</p>

<ul>
<li>[appname]app.com</li>
<li>get[appname].com</li>
<li>[appname].[io|us|eu|relevant_tld]</li>
<li>[appname].com.[relevant_tld] if applicable</li>
<li>[what_the_app_does].com</li>
</ul>

<p>.net and .org can also work if they can apply to you (IT/telco company or non-profit respectively).</p>

<p>Just stay away from .info and .biz. The two got polluted by spammers and reportedly (notoriously?) get lower rankings in Google.</p>
