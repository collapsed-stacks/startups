I want to launch an app which I think is a great idea. I've thought of an obvious name for it depending the main use of the app. Should I launch the app without getting the domain name? or should I use other name for my app. Planning to launch the app on all measure platforms.

I got almost everything but just not the domain name.

There's more to domain names than [appname].com. Among the other "generally acceptable" domains type options, try:

- [appname]app.com
- get[appname].com
- [appname].[io|us|eu|relevant_tld]
- [appname].com.[relevant_tld] if applicable
- [what_the_app_does].com

.net and .org can also work if they can apply to you (IT/telco company or non-profit respectively).

Just stay away from .info and .biz. The two got polluted by spammers and reportedly (notoriously?) get lower rankings in Google.
