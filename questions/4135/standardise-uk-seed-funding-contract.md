I have an investor interesting in investing in my UK limited company. Where can I find a standardised legal contract for seed investments in UK limited companies?

Many sites that offer such. Top results when Googling "standard agreement seed funding" include:

- https://www.ycombinator.com/documents/
- http://www.seriesseed.com/
- http://www.techstars.com/docs/

They're technically US-centric, but the US' legal system isn't so different from that of the UK -- both follow common law rather than roman law.
