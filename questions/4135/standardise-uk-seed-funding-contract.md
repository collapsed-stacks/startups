<p>Many sites that offer such. Top results when Googling "standard agreement seed funding" include:</p>

<li><a href="http://www.techstars.com/docs/" rel="nofollow">http://www.techstars.com/docs/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>They're technically US-centric, but the US' legal system isn't so different from that of the UK -- both follow common law rather than roman law.</p>
