<p>I know very little about venture capital, so assume you have the following two companies who have raised the following:</p>

<p><strong>Company X:</strong></p>

<p>Series A: $2 million</p>

<p>Series B: $10 million</p>

<p><strong>Company Z:</strong></p>

<p>Angel: $500k</p>

<p>Venture: $3 million</p>

<p>Series A: $5 million</p>

<p>Can anything be said about the financial trajectory of either of these companies relative to one another, given that Company Z raised a higher series A, and has yet to raise a Series B?</p>

<p>Is it more likely that Company Z will raise a higher series B than company X? Or are these numbers meaningless on their own?</p>

<p>The numbers are definitely meaningless on their own.</p>

<p>There are two important metrics missing:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Time - We know nothing about the intervals between rounds. Timing is everything.</p></li>
<li><p>Stake - This is probably most important - what ratio has been given up? Do investors already own 90% of the company? E.g. how many shares have been sold and how big is the pool? Maybe Company X doesn't have any shares left to sell without diluting 1% and they can't reasonably raise anymore investment given their projected capitalization.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Also, a side note, but usually Venture Capital firm is classified as a series investment. In how you stated it, I read "venture" as the "who" and not the "what." This is also true with "angel" (another 'who').</p>

<p>On these metrics alone, nothing can be said of the trajectory. Don't really think this can be debated.  </p>

<p>The numbers are mostly meaningless on their own. Imagine if X got to series B in 5 years while Z got to series A in two.</p>
