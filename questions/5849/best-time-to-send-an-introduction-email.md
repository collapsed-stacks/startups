<p>I am going to send an introduction email and I was planning on doing this tomorrow. I am not sure of the best time to send it though...</p>

<p>My clients are primarily creative professionals (they have work so they have to go to the office). To be more specific, this is an introduction email for a hosting company.</p>

<p>Define introduction email: there are a couple of people who have shown interest in the product before the release, and it's going to release soon. This data and more information will be put in the introduction email.</p>

<p>So when is the best time to send it? If I need to specify additional information about my clients please say so.</p>

<p>According to me, the best time to send an introduction mail is around <strong>noon</strong>.</p>

<p>People might have finished their high priority tasks and now might be little free for having a look at couple of unexpected emails.</p>

<p>I personally prefer sending an email before the lunch hour. But this is not a standard, you need to make sure people are not too busy at that time to check your mail.</p>

<p>You must <strong>always follow up</strong> <em>1-2 days</em> after sending the first mail as people generally respond positively to second or third mail only. Be persistent but don't spam their mail box.</p>

<p>EDIT: Generally we reply to the first email to remind the person of our mail. It should be a reminder to take action. Sometimes people just like your idea and then think they'll take an action over it but forget about it due to their busy schedule. </p>

<p>This follow-up email is to remind them of your existence. But this email should be something more than just a reminder, it should give some information, your client might be looking for, which was lacking in first mail.</p>
