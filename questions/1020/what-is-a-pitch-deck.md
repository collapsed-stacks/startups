<p>A pitch deck is a set of slides used for your presentation when presenting your startup to prospective investors.</p>

<p>The slides add visuals to your presentation and highlight key points. </p>

<p>When I did door to door sales, I had a binder full of images that went along with my presentation highlighting features of the service I was selling. Perhaps you've experienced something like that - if so, you know how it can be useful in a presentation.  </p>

<p>Or perhaps you've seen a good speaker user a powerpoint presentation - often these are done poorly (i.e.  it's simply text that says the same thing the presenter is saying and adds no value... other than to help the presenter remember where he is in his speech), but if you've seen someone do it well, again, you'll have seen how this can be leveraged (if you haven't, go watch videos of some of the big tech announcements and see how they use slides in their presentations then think - "What did they do well, and how can I apply it to pitching my startup?").</p>

<p>Some of the key points and graphics you'll want in a pitch deck will cover: </p>

<ul>
<li>What problem you're solving</li>
<li>How you intend to solve it</li>
<li>How big the need (market) is for that solution</li>
<li>Is there any competition already providing a similar solution?</li>
<li>What have you done so far to develop your product/service</li>
<li>What have you done so far to reach that market (and how successful has that been?)</li>
<li>Who's on your team (and what experience do they have?)</li>
<li>What do you need the money for specifically</li>
<li>What is your growth strategy</li>
<li>How do you expect to make money off this idea?</li>
</ul>
