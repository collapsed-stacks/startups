I have a database containing 50 Million useful records which can be used globally, and I would like to create a Website and get revenue by:

 1. Placing Google Ads.
 2. Providing some services also.

Now my biggest concern is the time when google finishing indexing whole pages to be appear in Google search.

Can you please advice me and explain the risks of this business?

1. You've built the content? Good. Progress.

 Now optimize it: higher quality, no duplicate postings, originality etc.

2. You now need to get your content indexed by all the major search engines. 

 Now optimize your SEO / schema (I assume they are of a certain schema or content type). Follow SEO standards and conventions. Consider this step 2.5 - it's very important that search engines don't penalize your website/content for being improperly formatted or misleading.

3. Generate some buzz for what you've built. Direct people to your website. Typical marketing stuff.

 You guessed it: Optimize your content reception. Fine tune your target market. Build better campaigns. Bring your CPA down. Use the best keywords etc.

Your question is a bit vague, but this is the generic approach. If your content is bad or poorly constructed, don't expect it to be very successful. Youtube didn't start with 50 million crappy videos. It started with addicting / funny / original / (insert your favorite adjective here) content. There are many success stories like this.

The risk is the opportunity cost of your time - what else could you be doing? If the content is good, you'll either have to convince other people it's good, good enough that they'll convince other people who will need to convince other people. It needs to be **great-level** good. Otherwise you're stuck pouring money into marketing that ends up as a black hole when you're going over quarterly budget statements. 

What makes revenue? Value (or perceived value). Currently, your idea is worth 

    VALUE = AVG_VALUE_PER_ITEM * NUM_ITEMS

Since your idea isn't at the market, your AVG_VALUE_PER_ITEM is **zero**. It's your job as founder to make it first .0001, then .0002, and slowly work it up and prove to others that the item value is real. 

Or else they might as well be 50 trillion worthless items.
