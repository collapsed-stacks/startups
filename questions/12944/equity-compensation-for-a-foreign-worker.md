<p>In such a setup it's not an employee; it's a contractor.</p>

<p>Regardless of actual denomination and status, the answer is yes: compensation can include anything that the two parties agree on.</p>

<p>Mind the modalities, too, because the tax implications widely depend on how the equity is given and the country of residence of its recipient. For this you're better off involving a professional as already suggested in the comments.</p>
