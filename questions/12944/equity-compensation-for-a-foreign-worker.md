Can an employee working from India get equity compensation from the employer who is registered in the USA? The employee does not hold a work visa in the USA and the employer does not have a registered entity in India.

In such a setup it's not an employee; it's a contractor.

Regardless of actual denomination and status, the answer is yes: compensation can include anything that the two parties agree on.

Mind the modalities, too, because the tax implications widely depend on how the equity is given and the country of residence of its recipient. For this you're better off involving a professional as already suggested in the comments.
