Developing an app for 2 years and 2 girl with online marketing experience would join and help developing business. How much stock should I give them? Which strategy you suggest? App is a dating application, similar to Tinder, but with extra features. I thought to give them 2% when we reach 1000 user, and +3% when reach 10000 user.
