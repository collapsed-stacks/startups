Looking for suggestions on how to be a massive parallel entrepreneur, which is to say an entrepreneur that actively manages more that just a few startups; note that this not the same as a serial entrepreneur. 

Open to analysis based on family-controlled monopolies, though only if the logic presented is inferred to apply to a massive parallel entrepreneur; only singular word I've heard used for family-controlled monopolies is a [zaibatsu][1].

**NOTE:** *If you post an answer that is not completely oriented towards "how to be" (vs. "why not to be") - I will flag the answer as off-topic and down-vote it too.*

I've never done this successfully but I'll try to help.

First, congrats on stepping outside the box! Prepare to get flak from the startup community for going against their tradition. I don't agree that you should get any flak, but, at the end of this post, I'll explain why you may get flak, and how to avoid it.

**The Critical Question: Are you coming from money?**
The critical question is- do you currently have a strong funding source, or are you starting from scratch?

A strong funding source would be:

 - Existing business generating over 200K in profits after paying your living costs.
 - Disposable savings/family money over $300K. (Not 300K, but a disposable 300K that you could be happy to lose.)

Most people I am aware of who did this first had one core business or funding source which provided a lot- often millions.
Then, they split that revenue into many other ventures.

**Some examples:**

 - Classic example: Sir Richard Branson of Virgin. He started with Virgin Records. Only once that gained momentum, did he move to other things. But I wonder what stage it was at when he began to branch? That should be a well-documented case.

 - Ray Sharma might be one example of someone who started many things at once. But from what I know, it was mostly his work on Extreme Labs that generated the revenue for the rest of his businesses. I personally am skeptical that he started with dozens of companies before striking it big on one:

 - I know of someone whose father was into real estate. When he inherited the business, he then invested in several tech companies.
I cannot say whether that was wise, I don't know. I think he did have some successes.

From what I've seen in incubators and friends- parallel entrepreneurism is very rare. But, it's also rarely attempted. Most people fall into a specific passion.

**Starting from scratch:**
Personally, I think this is possible but hard. I've personally tried to start side projects, even non-profit ones, and I've always found that it just ends up taking too much focus from my core revenue-generating activity. That is only my experience, and I do believe that there could be better ways.

 - Founding an incubator is the modern way to do it. There's also often government funds to help subsidize these incubators. You might be able to find many partners who will contribute seed capital. It may be hard to convince people without existing startup experience.
 - Traditional way I've seen: Start slowly with real estate. Sell some in 15 years and use that as seed capital. Might sound like a long term plan, but it's been done before and therefore somewhat realistic.
 - Crowdfund many interesting ideas. You'll need a lot of cash for marketing, videos and possibly prototyping. KickStarter does NOT sell itself. I'd budget at least $14K (in 2014 dollars) per KickStarter if you want to build any momentum. (Factoring in a proper video, plus marketing of at least $7K, plus a prototype.) That might sound expensive, but trust me, I've tried it. Kick Starting without existing momentum is hard.
 - Outsource or build businesses in overseas markets, where labour and startup costs are less expensive. Odesk.com is your friend in this case.
 - Compete for large contracts. For example, in Canada, you can pitch your tech business products to the government for a $400-500K contract. (It's called BCIP.) I'd recommend getting professional writers to make the application, if you can afford it. That alone can be about $7K.
 - Become a web marketing guru. This will take years of experience, but I do know of a marketing guru who **claims** to make about $100K per webinar. Now, is he exaggerating this claim? I don't know. From my business conversations with him, and spending time with him personally, he seems to definitely be making strong revenue. But I'm skeptical enough not to try it. He pointed to resources like WarriorForum.com as a starting point. Looks spammy, but I haven't tried it.

**Why is this (currently, 2014) against the grain?**
People have found, so far, that focusing intensely on one idea or market is the key to breaking into it. Incubators and pro investors have been burned time and time again by entrepreneurs who abandon one idea for another, or who have divided attention, or who overcommit. Due to many incubators' history of failure with founders who are parallel entrepreneurs, they shun it. In fact, top incubators likely will not accept anyone who has an outside business, even if it seems positive. There are exceptions in some cases, of course, but it's rare.

**I had to deal with this mentality myself.**
I was told this specifically when I tried to start a 2nd business and applied to Extreme Labs. They said my current business (call it First Inc), which was very profitable at the time, was a problem for them, because I had too little to lose. Should things go great with my existing business, I'll stop focusing on the new company. Should the new company start failing, why would I pour more time into the new company when I have an alternative?

It's also very expensive to grow, so spreading marketing, tech and sales dollars thin will be problematic.

**Positioning it Without Getting Flak**
However, if you position it correctly, as in "I want to make a better incubator" rather than "I have 5 different businesses I want to start" then it's possible to do this without going against the grain.

<p>In the startup world, today's prevailing fashion is heavily influenced by the inter-related lean / customer development / agile movements. The search is for real problems, for a reachable customer group, where a solution is rare enough and important enough to create value.</p>

<p>So the multipreneur is a bit unfashionable, because the idea of many ventures doesn't fit this model.</p>

<p>However, when you look around, it's easy to find people who are creating multiple ventures, in related or totally separate niches. To find out about that world, I don't know a better place than the <a href="http://www.startupsfortherestofus.com/" rel="nofollow">Startups for the rest of us</a> podcasts from Rob Walling and Mike Taber.</p>

<p>In my experience, the kind of family-owned-and-managed conglomerates you have in view aren't a part of the startup world in any meaningful sense. Typically, new ventures are enabled by the ready access to capital, which is available in a pretty consistent way from seed / exploratory stage right up to scale.</p>
