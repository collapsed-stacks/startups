I have a free ios (iphone) app that is very close to 100k downloads. However, I see usually, less than $1/day ad revenue. CTR is usually, 0.5% and the fill rate is 35%. Further, about one unit on average gets sold (i.e., upgrades to remove ads). What could be the problem with the ads? Is it the advertising provider?

I found what the problem was. It was due to two reasons: the fill rates and the type of ads. Most of my sessions were coming from areas my previous ad network has poor to no fills in. On the other hand, I've been using very low performing ad types. Recently I changed the ad network and the ad type to interstitials. Actually, the latter is less of a distraction for the users now. And the revenue rised from less than $1/day to more than $5/day.
