I have a business idea I'm developing but I really don't know how the market will receive it. 

what are the best practices to contact the experts or people in the actual market to receive a feedback or even a commercial partner for my product. 

if it helps, my product targets the content and book publishing markets

Use LinkedIn to find out who they are. You can search by title and industry. Then search for them on Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. That will give you a mechanism through which you can contact them.

If you find their email address while searching, make sure to send a very clear but brief explanation of what you want to do. Don't email them more than once per week (to avoid annoying them).
