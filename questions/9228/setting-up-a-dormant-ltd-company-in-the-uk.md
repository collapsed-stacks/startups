I have setup a new Ltd in the UK via companies house and it's incorporated (as of yesterday). However I'm not sure when I will begin trading! It's looking like I might not start trading until next year now due to other commitments. I mainly incorporated to protect the brand at this stage and to start looking into things regarding next steps and setting up the business plans, etc.

 After looking at the documents of the government website: https://www.gov.uk/dormant-company/dormant-for-corporation-tax I can state it is dormant.

1.) What exactly do I have to send them to tell them this? As from looking at the website they still require the finances, etc.

2.) Do I need to keep telling them the company is dormant? So for example if I still haven't started trading next year... Or does it just remain dormant until I tell them I have begun trading?

I haven't registered for Corporation tax yet!
