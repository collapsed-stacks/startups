<p>I have setup a new Ltd in the UK via companies house and it's incorporated (as of yesterday). However I'm not sure when I will begin trading! It's looking like I might not start trading until next year now due to other commitments. I mainly incorporated to protect the brand at this stage and to start looking into things regarding next steps and setting up the business plans, etc.</p>

<p>After looking at the documents of the government website: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/dormant-company/dormant-for-corporation-tax" rel="nofollow">https://www.gov.uk/dormant-company/dormant-for-corporation-tax</a> I can state it is dormant.</p>

<p>1.) What exactly do I have to send them to tell them this? As from looking at the website they still require the finances, etc.</p>

<p>2.) Do I need to keep telling them the company is dormant? So for example if I still haven't started trading next year... Or does it just remain dormant until I tell them I have begun trading?</p>

<p>I haven't registered for Corporation tax yet!</p>
