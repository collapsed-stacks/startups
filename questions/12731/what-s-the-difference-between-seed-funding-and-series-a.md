Is there a fundamental difference between "seed funding" and "series A"? What's the **DEFINITION**?

The following seem to be oft-repeated but incorrect definitions:

 * **Source of funding** (friends and family vs. pros): Counterexample: Y-combinator calls its funding "seed".

 * **The amount** (less than vs. greater than about $1M): Counterexample: a company I know that raised $3M and called it "seed".

 * **First round vs. second**: Counterexample: any company that skipped "seed" and only raised "series A". Likewise, I think there are companies that raise multiple "seed" rounds.

Are there any differences in how the law treats the two rounds, or how the board seats are distributed?

*(This question is about USA/California, if that makes any difference)*

<p>This industry, just like finance, has its own internal standards and their are no "set" definitions or standards like the <strong>IEEE</strong>, FOR DEFINITIONS OF FINANCING UNLESS THE FIRM/PERSON REQUIRES YOU TO FILE A <strong>FORM D</strong>.</p>

<h1>What is a Form D?</h1>

<ul>
<li><strong>Form D</strong>

<ul>
<li><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_D" rel="nofollow noreferrer">an SEC filing form to be used to file a notice of an exempt offering of securities under Regulation D of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.</a></em></li>

<h2> <strong>EACH VC FIRM,ESPECIALLY IN CALIFORNIA,HAVE DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS OF WHAT A SEED ROUND IS.</strong></h2>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.cooleygo.com/difference-friends-family-seed-series-financings/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">MIGUEL VEGA from Cooleygo "The definition of a seed investment will vary somewhat depending on whom you ask."</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The definition of a seed investment will vary somewhat depending on
  whom you ask. It would not be unusual for someone to refer to a larger
  friends and family financing as a seed financing. However, the term
  seed financing usually denotes a company’s first round of financing
  from third party investors who regularly invest in startup companies.
  These investors are typically individual angel investors, formal angel
  organizations or even venture capital funds. Seed investments are
  usually made through a mix of equity and loans, or sometimes
  convertible loan notes (often with a cap on the conversion value – see
  also The (Troublesome) Convertible Note Cap), simplified (short form)
  “series seed” financing documents or (often if led by a VC) “full”
  Series A style investment documents (see below). The structure
  selected for the investment will depend on investor preference and the
  availability of tax incentives, and will be influenced by the amount
  raised. As a general matter it is fair to say that the larger the
  amount raised, the more likely that the investors will use more formal
  and detailed investment documents.
  Subject to the caveats above, investment amounts under USD/EUR 1,000,000 or so > will often use convertible notes or Series Seed investment documentation.</p>

<ul>
<li>This is true. The Y-Combinator in itself gets a pretty decent stake in your company (I have no idea if their portion of equity is dilutable, I would assume not) for tremendous resources at your disposal to help you succeed.Because of their proven track record, they essential give startups seed money , but receive a <em>series a</em> equity stake in terms of the valuation of the company (not 20%+ like series A) and I think it justified because of how good their reputation is. With that being said all startups have different needs and other incubators out there exist as well.

<li>They can call it whatever they want and it really should be called a seed on steroids because:

<li>They have arguable the best incubator in the country because of their network, knowledge and proven track record in the areas of expertise(I know they are fluent in software) As always each startup/person should do their homework to see how good they their track record is.

By definition seed money or seed capital is the money an investor would put in your young business in exchange for equity stakes in your company. In most cases you would raise the seed money from your family, friends or people you know personally and this money would go towards covering the initial expense of your company. 

On the other hand, the Series A round, usually goes into expanding your business, running a comprehensive marketing campaigning and also being aggressive with the pricing. Here you need to keep in mind two important things – Pre-Money Valuation which is what your company is valued at which is 3 million (as per the Seed Funding example) and the Post Money Valuation which is Pre-Money Valuation plus what you raise from the investors. Let’s assume you are able to get a funding 1 million through Series A Funding your valuation would now stand at 4 million.

Seeds funding is the first fund you get for your startup, This money should help you in the initail stage of the startup, In many times seed fund helps the startup to get few employees, build and launch an early product.

Series A funding, usually will come after you have the early version of the product and you need to optimaize it. Typically, In series A funding you will raise more money then from seeds funding, and the money should help the company to figure out a business model and ways to optimize the product.

<p>Q: Are there any differences in how the law treats the two rounds?</p>

<ul>
<li>No</li>
</ul>

<p>The distinction is merely semantic, and any material differences are merely contractual.  (i.e. the terms of the deal are decided between the investors and investees.) </p>

<p>Q: Are there any differences in how the board seats are distributed?</p>

<ul>
<li>Possibly</li>
</ul>

<p>Again, this is purely contractual.  It all comes down to what the different rounds of investors want in return for their investment, and the perceived value and health of the company.  </p>

<p>(If the startup is doing well, the investee has all the power, but if the startup is struggling, the investors have all the power and their stipulations will be draconian.)   </p>

<hr>

<p>What investors are going to be interested in from a legal standpoint is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_agreement" rel="nofollow noreferrer">operating agreement</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/By-law#Organizational_by-laws" rel="nofollow noreferrer">by-laws</a>, and the terms of any deal are solely between the investor and investee.  </p>

<p>What the government cares about is the type of corporate entity for tax purposes.</p>
