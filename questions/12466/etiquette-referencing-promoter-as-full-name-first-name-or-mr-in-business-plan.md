In a business plan, specifically in the Company Description section and Promoter subsection, does there exist an etiquette when referencing the promoter's name?

Examples:

> **John Smith** actively draws on his experience as an accountant.
> 
> **John** actively draws on his experience as an accountant.
> 
> **Mr. Smith** actively draws on his experience as an accountant.
> 
> **Mr. John Smith** actively draws on his experience as an accountant.

There isn't really a "set way" of doing it but the typical way I see in my job when reviewing Partnership/Fund docs  is just they're full name ("John Smith") - this avoids having to state "Miss", "Mrs" or "Ms" when referring to a woman. If they are a doctor, that usually is prefixed though.

I would use the journalistic approach:  The first time the person is mentioned, use "John Smith".  Each subsequent time the person is mentioned, use "Mr. Smith".  This is how magazine and newspaper articles have been referencing people for decades, so I would think that most readers are familiar and comfortable with it.
