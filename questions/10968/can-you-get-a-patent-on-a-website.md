<p>You can't really patent a website.  Now, that being said, you <em>can</em> copyright or trademark content if it is original and you are the lawful owner of the materials you're filing for.</p>

<p>You can file for patents on some aspects of your <em>code</em> or <em>business processes</em>, as long as you meet the litmus test for doing so.  This is a bit of a tricky area, so you might be better off looking at the U.S. Patent Office web site to learn more.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.uspto.gov/patents-getting-started/general-information-concerning-patents#heading-4" rel="nofollow">Here's a link to the Patent Office section on what can and can't be patented</a> that might give you some insights.</p>

<p>I hope this helps.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
