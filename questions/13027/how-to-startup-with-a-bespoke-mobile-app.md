<p>I'm having a mobile app and a web control panel which can be easily provide for a school, college or any educational firm and school admins, teachers, parents, students could use this software platform to collaborate and interactively mange their day today schedules, communications and some more features are adding. </p>

<p>I'll charge a monthly subscription amount per each and every student from each school/college.</p>

<p>My local school body is like below</p>

<ul>
<li>school management</li>
<li>principal</li>
<li>teachers</li>
<li>parent organizations</li>
<li>students</li>
</ul>

<p>Whats the procedure to introduce this to schools. 
Is advertising worth?
For what audience should I demonstrate this?</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I know nothing about schools or the administration of schools.</p>

<p>It seems as though your customers are the people who make all the "buying decisions" for a school.  In addition, you should make sure the schools you approach do not already have software or apps like yours.</p>

<p>(There are arguments to be made for approaching smaller schools, or approaching larger schools. Smaller schools would need to pay less, since they have fewer students / teachers / parents. But larger schools will probably have a larger budget, so they could afford your app more easily.)</p>

<p>If you can arrange a meeting with them, prepare a pitch. Demonstrate the key benefits of your app. Explain how you will distribute it to management, principal, teachers, parents, and students. Show or describe the benefits that each of those groups will get, and be as specific as possible (regarding minutes/hours saved, cost savings, etc.) while still being accurate and truthful.  Keep your presentation short - 10 minutes or less - and include visuals, such as your app and various screenshots of your app.</p>

<p>You may need to offer a few free months of app usage to a school, with the option to start the paid subscription after the free trial. During that time, hopefully all the users will have fallen in love with your app and can't live without it, so they'll <em>have to</em> convert their subscription into a paid subscription.</p>
