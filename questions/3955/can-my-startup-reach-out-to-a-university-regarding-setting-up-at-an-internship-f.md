I'm looking for interns at my startup. I'm curious if anyone here has some HR-related experience regarding getting set up at a career / internship fair in order to talk to prospective interns about a possible summer opportunity.

Does it matter how large / recognized your business is? Or is it only important that it's officially registered etc.

What matters in practice:

1. Your company is officially registered.
2. It's an actual internship, as opposed to cheap labor used to "replace" an employee who is e.g. on maternity leave.
3. As such, there is a clearly identified supervisor.
4. The supervisor is willing to follow up with the university as needed, e.g. for feedback, for when the intern will be presenting her work, etc.

Advertising the internship is straightforward: send an email to the relevant department at the university (if one is in charge of internships and placements) or e.g. a teacher in the department where you're hoping to find a student. Student fairs work too.
