<p>I'm looking for interns at my startup. I'm curious if anyone here has some HR-related experience regarding getting set up at a career / internship fair in order to talk to prospective interns about a possible summer opportunity.</p>

<p>Does it matter how large / recognized your business is? Or is it only important that it's officially registered etc.</p>

<p>What matters in practice:</p>

<ol>
<li>Your company is officially registered.</li>
<li>It's an actual internship, as opposed to cheap labor used to "replace" an employee who is e.g. on maternity leave.</li>
<li>As such, there is a clearly identified supervisor.</li>
<li>The supervisor is willing to follow up with the university as needed, e.g. for feedback, for when the intern will be presenting her work, etc.</li>
</ol>

<p>Advertising the internship is straightforward: send an email to the relevant department at the university (if one is in charge of internships and placements) or e.g. a teacher in the department where you're hoping to find a student. Student fairs work too.</p>
