I have a few website ideas that target the exact same audience, but each idea would give a completely different service. Should I include them all in one domain, or make separate ones with the same color scheme to make it clear they're related and link them all together?

Started designing the main page and going to be making it myself when I start my computer science degree in October. The university offers free web hosting and loads of help with startups. Target audience is students so I'll mainly be using social media to promote the sites.

You could style it like Stack Exchange I guess. For example jupiter.space.com for your Jupiter service and saturn.space.com for your Saturn one etc. Although a few things you may want to note is that if you're getting an SSL each xxxxx.space.com website would require its own SSL certificate or a wildcard one(more money). Also *apparently* (I am not very knowledgeable in this area) Google would treat them as separate sites. Which may not be great or may make no difference, depending on how you plan to popularize your site.

It would be great if you would provide more info, your situation is not very clear(to me at least :D ). Like if you're setting up the site yourself(web development). It would help you get better answers.

Even if you target the same audience but the sites aren't related then there isn't much of a point putting them together.

The answer to your question really depends on how related your website ideas are. If they are really close, i.e. you're building tools to help students learn then you definitely should put them all under one site. However if your ideas are in different domains, i.e. one idea is to help students find and share rooms and the other idea is to help students to prepare for tests, than you should avoid putting them together.

I originally set up my sites with a main site and 4 others underneath it. This was in Wordpress so it might be different, however I found that it didn't work for me. The major reason was that I couldn't run website protection software when sites were nested and I ended up getting hacked and it cost me a lot of money and time. There were however some plusses. It was easier with one log-in but I did end up with a lot of pages and I had to upgrade my hosting capacity so it didn't really work for me. I now have 5 separate sites running on the same studio press theme and I am very happy with that for my business.
