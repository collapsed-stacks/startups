<p>How can I ensure that all of the basics concepts are analyzed? What tools/resources/models can I use that can agglomerate all the essential concepts?  </p>

<p>There is a model proposed by Dr. Alex Osterwalder called <a href="http://businessmodelgeneration.com/" rel="nofollow"><code>Business Model Canvas</code></a> that gather all the essential concepts in order to summarize the business. With this model, it is possible to have a global view that allows people to criticize and improve their ideia in order to make a "bullet-proof business".</p>
