<p>We are going to distribute our software dual license: AGPL-3 and our proprietary license.</p>

<p>I consider whether to give to the purchasing organization (for a single payment) either the unlimited right to use any version of our software or just one version.</p>

<p>But our software is distributed through GitHub and has is something like a running release that is it can change at any moment.</p>

<p>Does it make legal sense to say: "Purchase of the proprietary license gives you the right to download and use just one version from GitHub."</p>

<p>It is an interesting option, but it sounds like a nonsense. Does it have legal sense?</p>

<p>Also if they download a version and it does not work at all due a syntax error, would they be allowed to get another version (once, or until the bug is fixed)? or does it depends on our license wording?</p>

<p>And also (not sure if this question is permitted by site rules) I am interested what you advise: to sell a single version or perpetual right to use any version?</p>
