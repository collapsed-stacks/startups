We are going to distribute our software dual license: AGPL-3 and our proprietary license.

I consider whether to give to the purchasing organization (for a single payment) either the unlimited right to use any version of our software or just one version.

But our software is distributed through GitHub and has is something like a running release that is it can change at any moment.

Does it make legal sense to say: "Purchase of the proprietary license gives you the right to download and use just one version from GitHub."

It is an interesting option, but it sounds like a nonsense. Does it have legal sense?

Also if they download a version and it does not work at all due a syntax error, would they be allowed to get another version (once, or until the bug is fixed)? or does it depends on our license wording?

And also (not sure if this question is permitted by site rules) I am interested what you advise: to sell a single version or perpetual right to use any version?
