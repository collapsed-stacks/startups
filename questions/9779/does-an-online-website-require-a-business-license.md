<p>I am an individual and want to make a match-making website as I am also a developer. I want to host that website online and let people use it, promoting it through Facebook and general friend circle. However along with that I am also planning on launching counselling services and helplines on the same website which will not cost user anything except for a phone call fee that he will pay to his provider in case required. Services I am thinking might require user to share certain personal information like his personal details and stuff. Do I need any kind of license or need to be a registered business in order to launch it ? </p>

<p>In practice  you probably don't need any specific license beyond incorporating your business - which you should do <em>anyway</em>. At least not until you hit the stage where you're on any regulator's radar.</p>

<p>The sorrier realities of theory kick in when you grow bigger: you need to take a few administrative steps in countries that care about privacy and have laws to that effect. Count EU countries among the latter. In particular France, where you'd need to <a href="http://studiolabrame.com/en/blog-seo-webdesign/126-when-do-you-need-a-cnil-number-in-france.html" rel="nofollow">register your list to the CNIL</a> and comply with French privacy laws. (Failing to do so can land you in jail with a â‚¬300k fine.) Companies are for the most part <em>not</em> compliant, of course, so don't fuss too much about it. But have it in mind for when you grow big and are expanding in areas where privacy laws might actually matter.</p>

<p>There might also be some specific requirements depending on what activity you're doing - e.g. you can't set up shop saying "I'm a Doctor" without having an MD. Think of it this way: if you need some kind of special license or registration to operate offline in your country, you'll need to go through the same in order to operate online.</p>

<p>Lastly, and based on the tags you used: no, you don't need to register a pricey trademark upon setting up shop. That can - and should - wait until you've a modicum of traction and can afford it.</p>
