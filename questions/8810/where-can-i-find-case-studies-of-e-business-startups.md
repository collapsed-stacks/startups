<p>I do lots of research and I keep an eye on the "e business startups" as you call them.  Sources for my information are Forrester Research, Gallup, Financial Times, Bloomberg and CNBC websites, plus news.google.com and frequent searching there. Also I use my favorite search engine to search for startups fairs as they tend to reference something to promote the idea/concept/aims.</p>

<p>I prefer paper based articles as opposed to the internet and I am lucky enough to have an economics library near home that gets magazines/news papers from some of the sources above that are free to read on site. If you live in/near a big city, it might be worth asking them if they have a similar offering.</p>

<p>Either way, you need be creative with your searches - Taking one source will only give you one opinion which narrows your view.</p>

<p>Best of luck!</p>
