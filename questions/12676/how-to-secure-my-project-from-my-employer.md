<p>Not a conventional startup question, but I really need an advice. </p>

<p>So I am a software developer and work for a software company. My contract explicitly says that anything I do, be it during business hours or after, belongs to the company. Now I want to try to make a project with friends, but I'm not sure what to do with the mentioned contract. Even if they find out that I work on something, I can't imagine they can really figure out on what exactly (of course given that I never use their computers/networks/etc). </p>

<p>Do I need to take any additional steps, like don't use github (even private accounts), don't register any domain names on my name?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>That is a prickly situation.  I ran into something similar myself.  However I caught the issue in the employment agreement when I joined the company, so asked for a change to it to only cover IP created on company time or resources.  I told them I had been working on a novel and that the agreement as is would effectively sign over the rights of my novel to them.  </p>

<p>With the agreement already executed it obviously makes for a more complicated situation.  You could try a similar approach and ask to get your employment agreement updated.  The current agreement is unreasonably restrictive, you have always wanted to write a novel/textbook/howtoguide/youtubechannel/blog/whatever. </p>

<p>If that isn't possible, then be super discreet.  Create an an alternative "identity" with different email address, source control credentials, etc.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>You're question is not related to any startup query. I would like to answer this one though. Your project with friends should not be related anywhere to your current companies projects. You can work on your personal project with friends and not tell your company about it, I believe it is just an extra effort you will be doing as a passion to invent/implement something. If you are successful with your personal project and if you want to take it further then you can be in the advisory board/panel however you cannot own the entire entity as it will be against your current companies legal contract. I would suggest you take the help of an attorney and understand the contract properly. Your attorney will suggest you on what role you can take on your future company/project.</p>
