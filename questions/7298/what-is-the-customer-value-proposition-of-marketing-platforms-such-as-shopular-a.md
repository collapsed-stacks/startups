I can tell you something about shopkick only.

Shopkick incentivise people to visit certain stores and uses skinners box priciples to reward them.

So, the value propositions are...

1. It's a realization of gamification, so it's fun to collect kicks
2. You get discount, this is called illusion of saving
3. You get rewarded, (with discounts and kicks)
4. It is somewhat a "kick" to get a coupon right in the second you enter a store.

In the end, it's a way to first rise extrinsic motivation to visit a store, which morphs into more intrinsic motivation over some time.

Another interesting thing on that concept is: They decentivise people from the real value of "kicks". Think about it, why not say something like "here are 4 cents for visiting this store". They hide the value, by give you 20 kicks.

Hope that answers your questions. Feel free to ask.
