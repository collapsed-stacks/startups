<p>I can tell you something about shopkick only.</p>

<p>Shopkick incentivise people to visit certain stores and uses skinners box priciples to reward them.</p>

<p>So, the value propositions are...</p>

<ol>
<li>It's a realization of gamification, so it's fun to collect kicks</li>
<li>You get discount, this is called illusion of saving</li>
<li>You get rewarded, (with discounts and kicks)</li>
<li>It is somewhat a "kick" to get a coupon right in the second you enter a store.</li>
</ol>

<p>In the end, it's a way to first rise extrinsic motivation to visit a store, which morphs into more intrinsic motivation over some time.</p>

<p>Another interesting thing on that concept is: They decentivise people from the real value of "kicks". Think about it, why not say something like "here are 4 cents for visiting this store". They hide the value, by give you 20 kicks.</p>

<p>Hope that answers your questions. Feel free to ask.</p>
