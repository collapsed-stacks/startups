I just created my company.

Now I have to pay 34.4$ to buy my shares.

I can't write a check, but I can do a wire transfer.

My bank will have some fees, the company bank will have some fees, but it's always hard to know how much.

Say I spend for example 50$ to to pay 15.6$ of outbound bank fees, then I send 34.4$ to the company

Then the company's bank charge 5$ inbound bank fee, so finally the company account received 29.4$

Did I buy 34.4$ worth of shares ? or 29.4$ worth of shares ?

Thanks !
