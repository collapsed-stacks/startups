<p>I just created my company.</p>

<p>Now I have to pay 34.4$ to buy my shares.</p>

<p>I can't write a check, but I can do a wire transfer.</p>

<p>My bank will have some fees, the company bank will have some fees, but it's always hard to know how much.</p>

<p>Say I spend for example 50$ to to pay 15.6$ of outbound bank fees, then I send 34.4$ to the company</p>

<p>Then the company's bank charge 5$ inbound bank fee, so finally the company account received 29.4$</p>

<p>Did I buy 34.4$ worth of shares ? or 29.4$ worth of shares ?</p>

<p>Thanks !</p>
