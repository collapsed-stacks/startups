<p>At early stages, if you want to make something great then: no work-life balance.</p>

<p>Technology is evolving and there are a lot of people working on the same idea as you, even if you don't know it. To succeed you have to work harder, smarter, longer hours in this competition. No holidays, your social events are customer development meetings, </p>

<p>On the stress part, it is possible. Every job brings on some sort of stress on you. Startups usually bring on more stress, because of the uncertainty, funds, difficulty, cofounders. But if you somehow put your financials in order, know that your idea will work somehow and know exactly how to execute it and have great cofounders you might have lower stress than a regular day job. For me personally I had more stress at my first 2 startups where I was basically walking in the dark, but now that I have the experience and I can see where I am going I am less stressful. </p>

<p>Here is a great quote from <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/wealth.html" rel="nofollow">Paul Graham</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Startups are not magic. They don't change the laws of wealth creation.
  They just represent a point at the far end of the curve. There is a
  conservation law at work here: if you want to make a million dollars,
  you have to endure a million dollars' worth of pain. For example, one
  way to make a million dollars would be to work for the Post Office
  your whole life, and save every penny of your salary. Imagine the
  stress of working for the Post Office for fifty years. In a startup
  you compress all this stress into three or four years. You do tend to
  get a certain bulk discount if you buy the economy-size pain, but you
  can't evade the fundamental conservation law. If starting a startup
  were easy, everyone would do it.</p>

<p>Key to achieve work life balance is to have discipline and figure out your priorities. If that sounds too abstract let me give you the following concrete tips:</p>

<ul>
<li>Work only with nice people. If you have a toxic work environment it can take a bit toll on your personal life as well. Always try to hire or team up with nice people. It does not matter how good they are if they are going to drag down the morale of the entire team. In the long run for your company a nice person always beats that one guy who was really great at work but did not get along with anyone.</li>
<li>Do not have a long commute to work. Many people do not realize this but a long commute to work can be very taxing. If you need to optimize for rent in terms of the place to stay figure out an alternative. Since you will commute every day to work saving a few minutes can lead to several hours of saving over the year.</li>
<li>Set up the right expectations. Most often it is not that people expect you to work all the time. If you set clear expectations about how many hours you are willing to put on a typical day people actually appreciate it. </li>
<li>In your personal life prioritize tasks just as you would for work. That means breaking things down to week or day. If you need to take your son to a football game make space for that. If you think about buying something nice for your wife do that. Make sure you have some personal tasks on a weekly or daily basis. </li>
<li>If you can get up early. It will give you that extra hour or so at home and you can get a lot done in the early morning hours before anyone is even out of bed.</li>
</ul>

<p>No. Its a stressful job and it should be. The thing you need to understand that as a founder the startup is what you do. It comes down to time working and time you are taking a break from it and recharging to go back to work. Its good to have a supporting family and group of friends who understand what you do and support you. If you really believe in your work, then you really do not think about it much at all. </p>

<p>For me, most of my stress comes from frustration at how slow things can move. </p>

<p>Yes! As a partner in a startup myself, I can vouch for a <a href="https://tallyfy.com/stressed-work-manage-work-stress/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">low-stress life</a> while putting a lot of your time and effort into your company. These tips helped me and will hopefully help you: </p>

<ul>
<li>Don't be reactive- When you’re feeling stressed over work-related issues, don’t immediately react. Take the time to sort out what you can do about that particular situation.</li>
<li>Stop trying to do it all</li>
<li>Delegate- use your team!</li>
<li>Take regular breaks</li>
<li>Improve your eating and sleeping habits</li>

</ul>
