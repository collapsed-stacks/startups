<p>I have developed an application and its in closed beta testing for android.
I have named my application Audition ToolKit. It performs some of the actions of Adobe Audition. Is there a copyright infringement or offence in using a similar name. For now, I have given a bold disclaimer saying, the application is not affiliated or related to Adobe Audition.</p>

<p>All the applications have more then three features similar to the closest competition it's not a issue but before you go public consult with your startup lawyer and close beta who cares, call some friends who work at adobe and make them check it out. Big companies like competition. </p>

<p>I don't think so as long as you are not directly saying adobe audition toolkit etc read this blog for there trade <a href="http://www.adobe.com/legal/permissions/trademarks.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">marks</a>. 
Also make sure they haven't Reserved it as additional name </p>
