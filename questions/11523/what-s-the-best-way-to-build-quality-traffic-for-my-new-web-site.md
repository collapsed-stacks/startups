<p>I have a new web site up and running with a unique service I'm offering, and now my issue is that I need to figure out the best way to create interest and build a customer base.</p>

<p>There are all kinds of people on the web who claim they can send you thousands of visitors a day, but they're all scams because the traffic they send is garbage.  I tried a couple and had more than 20,000 visitors, not <em>one</em> of which was on the site for more than 2 seconds, so there's no way they were real.  The law of averages says that if they were genuine visitors then even if it was a <strong><em>crummy</em></strong> product or service, at least 1 or 2 would have requested more information, but there were none at all.  </p>

<p>I don't care about building traffic for the sake of a good Alexa or Google rating.  I need traffic from people who have an interest in what I sell.  </p>

<p>I have a pretty limited budget at this point, so how do I go about finding groups of people who potentially would be a good target market, and then what would be the best way to reach out to them?</p>

<p>Thousands of entrepreneurs have the same question and same issue... First coming to my mind - try Facebook finding related communities, and present yourself there - not <em>sell</em>, but <em>present</em>. Show what you do and how it may help others with their pain points, without any push. Word of mouth (and your acumen in using features of social network) should do the rest.</p>

<p>Be ready for mockery and envy - there's always a negativity in the social field. And this negativity should <strong>not stop you</strong> continuing search for customers or interested parties. If someone does not like you or does not like what you do - just think that this individual <em>is not your customer</em>.</p>

<p>As you do not need traffic, but you need customers, you should look in the communities rather than on the internet in general. Some specialized forums. Maybe even some companies you identify may be interested in what you do.</p>

<p>It is hard to give any detailed advice because you do not disclose what exactly your website is about.</p>
