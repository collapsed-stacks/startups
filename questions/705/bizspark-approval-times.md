<p>I was wondering if anyone had any experience of BizSpark approval times recently? I applied 5 working days ago and have heard nothing, despite their promise of responding within that time period.</p>

<p>Quick search on Google shows that the timeline provided does not match real world response times; appears to be weeks, if not months based on the search results I found.</p>

<p>My suggestion would be to email them (bizspark@microsoft.com) using the format they requested:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Contact name:<br>
  Startup name:<br>
  Microsoft Account/Live ID:<br>
  Specific description of issue experienced or question:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I actually just signed up for BizSpark today for a new startup, and the message reads something along the lines of "if you don't hear from us within five business days, contact us." So it sounds like you should just contact them and ask what's up. Although it really wouldn't surprise me if they were just a little late and got back to you next week. I'd probably give them until Tuesday or Wednesday then email.</p>

<p>BizSpark turnaround times also depend on the partner you select to go with. I received approval in just under 48 hours but the partner I went with gave me a url, showing the partner had approved me already. All of this was just a few weeks ago.</p>

<p>But if BizSpark promised a reply within a timeframe it is poor form for them not to honour that, even if just to say still within the queue or something similar.</p>
