<p>Over the last few years I have grown a number of communities across several domains including mobile and web. Most of these have been extremely organic without any direct plan, I simply created products/services I needed or wanted to use. In retrospect, self-design fostered the organic growth. However, the lack of planning resulted in time consuming process. I relied solely on publishing content consistently that was of reasonable quality to <a href="http://www.livethinkdesign.com/stories-that-surprise-and-delight/" rel="nofollow">tell a story</a>. </p>

<p>As a larger company this would be a very effective strategy for building long term relationships with the customer base. However, as a new business is this an appropriate strategy when revenue is critical to survival?</p>

<p>What strategies have you employed to accelerate your growth whilst maintaining a high quality product or service and ensuring you are connecting with the right audience? </p>

<p>Yes. Absolutely. If revenue was not an issue you could pay an agency to handle your marketing. However, after building the communities you mention above that means you have a talent for developing the first part of your marketing strategy. You can't sell anything without an audience. If you were already good at building the communities that means you should continue using those practices with this business so that you have an audience to sell your product to.</p>

<p>If you are still in early stages of customer/product development you might want to think about putting up a one page website/splash page which includes one call to action = "Enter your email to be the first to try our product for free." </p>

<p>You'll want to partner with a few relevant bloggers, organizations, businesses, etc so you can publish content on those sites and drive the traffic from those other website's over to your splash page. This allows you to collect prospect emails while you build.</p>

<p>Also just a sidenote: think about documenting every part of your process..especially when starting a new project. Just be writing about whatever you do for the business each day. Shouldn't take much mindshare because you just have to write what you do. Document the process. This content will accumulate into a lucrative information product soon.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
