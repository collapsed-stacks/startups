What does motivate employees to work? Of course salary is one of the "motivators". Employee do their work because they get money for that. They also can be motivated by a possibility to move higher in the company's hierarchy (but to large extend, it is also about money). But can a job itself be a motivator? Can it be that employee 
do their job because they like it and not because they just get something for that (money, higher position)?

So, my question is: What does motivate people?

Being a code monkey myself, here's what keeps me motivated: 

- Primarily the salary and opportunity to grow
- Learning new things and not constantly working on the same thing
- Good colleagues
- Good Management

If one of these isn't right, I'm pretty much out.
