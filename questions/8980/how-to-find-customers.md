I have several ideas about products I could develop and about services I could offer in the IT. My question now is how to find customers to offer my services. I had the idea to select a target of possible customer randomly and contact them, basically by email. This could be a way, could someone with some experience of a star from zero start-up give me some advice?

I really appreciate your help!

We all have ideas - executing those ideas and converting those actions into profits is an opportunity for some, and a challenge for others.

Without more specifics from you it will be difficult for anyone to share experience or offer guidance.

If you don't have a product or you don't have the facilities to offer a service, contacting a customer will not likely get you far. And if it does, do you expect them to pay you first to fund the product or service? If true, what experience have you got that will give them confidence that their money is not going to go to Vegas ?

Building a business is not easy - I'm not trying to put you off it, I am however trying to set expectations. If it were easy, more would try and fewer would fail.

Research your service, your competitors, and your customers.

Figure out how you will offer the product or service and how you can do it competitively and profitably. If you are going to offer the same product or service as the guy next door, at the same price, then you'll be seeking the customers he has not found.  There is slim chance of you taking any of his business away if your service is similar in quality and price. 

Start small - if you offer too many products/services too soon, you'll risk drowning if overly successful, or overstocked, or you will undertake responsibility beyond what you can deliver and disappoint the customer.

Before you open up shop, there are other things you should at very least consider. Consider points 1,2,3,6,7 https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/8576/how-to-build-a-startup-freelance-software-qa-in-the-us/8585#8585

Some methods you can offer to engage new customers?

 - Advertise in industry magazines and newspapers.
 - Cold calls (yes, picking up the phone and sweet talking the person at the other end)
 - Sending samples or offer free trials, followed with discounted samples/trials
 - Partner with another business (if you bake cookies, you can open your own bake shop or you could partner with a coffee shop and share your success with them).
