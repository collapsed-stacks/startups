<p>Given a company, is there a website where I can find out examples of its competitors?</p>

<p>Given two companies, is there a website where I can find out if they are competitors?</p>

<p>For example,
MediaMath is a company that does internet marketing. I am not familiar with their business model, so want to know examples of its competitors. For example, are the following companies its competitors</p>

<ul>
<li>Doubleclick, (someone said it is not a competitor of Mediamath, i.e. they are not competing in the same business)</li>
<li>Atlas</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Look into SimilarWeb.</p>

<p>Another good option is Google itself. Abuse Google auto-complete, and start typing "[company] vs". You'll get competitors more often than not, and then rinse and repeat with the competitors.</p>
