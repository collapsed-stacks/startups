Given a company, is there a website where I can find out examples of its competitors?

Given two companies, is there a website where I can find out if they are competitors?

For example,
MediaMath is a company that does internet marketing. I am not familiar with their business model, so want to know examples of its competitors. For example, are the following companies its competitors

- Doubleclick, (someone said it is not a competitor of Mediamath, i.e. they are not competing in the same business)
- Atlas

Thanks.

Look into SimilarWeb.

Another good option is Google itself. Abuse Google auto-complete, and start typing "[company] vs". You'll get competitors more often than not, and then rinse and repeat with the competitors.
