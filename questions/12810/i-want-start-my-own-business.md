<p>First of all, age does not matter. Even 18 year old can innovate, and 90 can too.</p>

<p>Guidance: You need to start attending conferences, networking sessions and also do more volunteering stuff to build up your network. Not always (good) guidance comes easily. You need to find a mentor that will be there for you at all (needed) times.</p>

<p>Support: Find a similar mindset person that wants to build a startup with you. For example, you want to build a startup in a Travel Industry, you may want to find your ex-colleague or friend who finds travel industry interesting or probably your idea.</p>

  <p>Do remember, no idea is perfect. So start small, if the idea has any
  value, people will make it big.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Registering a company, minimum age is based on country level. You may want to check on the government portal.</p>

<p>Last bit, my personal quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Work for people, and build the network.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>I think Smit's answer is very good, and will add a few points.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Most startups fail. The main reason is they run out of funds.  My number #1 piece of advice is to keep your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overhead_(business)" rel="nofollow noreferrer">overhead</a> as low as possible for as long as possible.</p></li>
<li><p>Partner with people you trust.  I can't over-stress the importance of this.  </p></li>
<li><p>Do your research!  By this I mean mostly market research, but it applies equally to every aspect of your particular business.  Become an information junkie.</p></li>
<li><p>Run the numbers, ad nauseam, when coming up with your business plan.  Even if you're not seeking investment, creating a comprehensive business plan with spreadsheets will be useful to you.  Run high, medium and low projections, and include worst-case scenarios.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure your product or service is something you're passionate about.  Starting a business may involve great sacrifice, and always involves risk, so you have to believe in what you're doing.  </p></li>
<li><p>If working with partners, when it's time to draw up contracts, use an experienced lawyer.  A bad operating agreement can break an LLC.  Avoid deadlock situations at all costs because unresolved deadlocks will generally result in the dissolution of the company.   </p></li>
<li><p>CYA ("Cover Your *ss") Make sure you understand what your <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/encyclopedia/liability" rel="nofollow noreferrer">liability</a> and exposure are.  Protect yourself accordingly.  </p></li>
</ul>
