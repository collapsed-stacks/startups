<p>I am an applied mathematics student, currently pursuing Ph.D. at a Graduate School, who is always willing to learn and has good leadership skills. (Partially) Based on my research, I have an idea for a new product (and the idea is developing more with time), and I want to start a company regarding the same once my Ph.D. is completed. (I am aware that my research is owned by my university, but my idea is not so directly related it.)</p>

<p>Being a science background student, I have no formal knowledge of commerce, management or business studies that may be prerequisite for starting a venture and I have never worked in any company. I have read some books on entrepreneurship that have lots of useful advice about dos and don'ts, but they do not talk about formal or technical prerequisites. How should I prepare myself now, (preferably, except joining a company after Ph.D.) so that when I start my company two or three years down the line I do not stumble at the technical nuances of business?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Entrepreneurship is very much trial-and-error, and learning through direct experience. The best knowledge to have prior to starting a business is in the fields of <strong>accounting</strong> and <strong>finance</strong>. Strong understanding of money management, business accounting, and taxes (to some degree) will help you avoid many stumbling blocks as you grow the business. </p>

<p>For example, </p>

<ul>
<li>how to price your product/offering in a realistic way; </li>
<li>how to acquire the employees and resources you need as you grow; </li>
<li>how to know where the business should be in the future (realistic goals).</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, you should also consult with professional accountants, but as a business owner it is critical to have the ability to oversee things yourself.</p>

<p>Aside from a legal business entity and enough cash in the bank to start the business, the foremost requirement to starting a business is the Business Plan for first year (or first 5 years), including monthly costs, time until break-even, and projected growth. This also includes a go-to-market strategy (advertising).</p>
