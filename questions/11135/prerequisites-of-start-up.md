I am an applied mathematics student, currently pursuing Ph.D. at a Graduate School, who is always willing to learn and has good leadership skills. (Partially) Based on my research, I have an idea for a new product (and the idea is developing more with time), and I want to start a company regarding the same once my Ph.D. is completed. (I am aware that my research is owned by my university, but my idea is not so directly related it.)

Being a science background student, I have no formal knowledge of commerce, management or business studies that may be prerequisite for starting a venture and I have never worked in any company. I have read some books on entrepreneurship that have lots of useful advice about dos and don'ts, but they do not talk about formal or technical prerequisites. How should I prepare myself now, (preferably, except joining a company after Ph.D.) so that when I start my company two or three years down the line I do not stumble at the technical nuances of business?

Thanks in advance.

Entrepreneurship is very much trial-and-error, and learning through direct experience. The best knowledge to have prior to starting a business is in the fields of **accounting** and **finance**. Strong understanding of money management, business accounting, and taxes (to some degree) will help you avoid many stumbling blocks as you grow the business. 

For example, 

 - how to price your product/offering in a realistic way; 
 - how to acquire the employees and resources you need as you grow; 
 - how to know where the business should be in the future (realistic goals).

Of course, you should also consult with professional accountants, but as a business owner it is critical to have the ability to oversee things yourself.

Aside from a legal business entity and enough cash in the bank to start the business, the foremost requirement to starting a business is the Business Plan for first year (or first 5 years), including monthly costs, time until break-even, and projected growth. This also includes a go-to-market strategy (advertising).
