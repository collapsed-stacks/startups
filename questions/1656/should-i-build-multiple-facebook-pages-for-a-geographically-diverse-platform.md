<p>I'm moving and expanding my business from Colorado to Texas, and I've never been concerned with this before. We have a Facebook page with about a thousand likes, and we largely use it to further promote our own website (and platform), especially by marking special events from Boulder and Denver (in Colorado).</p>

<p>We're moving to Austin, TX - a new market. I was asked if we should make a new Facebook page just as a sub-division to our market there. We could advertise events going on in Austin without having to worry about spamming our users back in Colorado (it's also somewhat ironic since our service is all about finding and experiencing local events you're interested in).</p>

<p><strong>I'm looking for pros/cons, any legal / ethical concerns (Facebook policies etc.), and just general Do's-Dont's for social media campaigns</strong>. </p>

<p>The company is ---, since someone would probably end up asking for context purposes. Edit: The company advertises personal local events and monetizes off of promotions and advertisements etc., focusing on hyper local content to bring relevance to its users.</p>

<p>For a company like yours, where location is important, I think it's a good strategy. I'd imagine users would be more engaged with a page that is relevant to them.</p>

<p>Uber also only operates in certain markets (although that number is quite large now) and it has facebook pages for individual locations. e.g. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ubersanantonio">San Antonio</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Uber-Denver/769368736428159">Denver</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Uber-New-Delhi/744211088993639">New Dehli</a>.</p>

<p>Seeing that it's common practice for companies to do this, I wouldn't worry about breaking any rules, although as blunders suggested it wouldn't hurt to ask.</p>

<p>I'd also suggest making a separate Colorado page if you go down this path. Since you have a lot of likes already on the main page, it wouldn't hurt to promote some location specific events on the main page, but I'd try to slowly wean off them as you expand.</p>
