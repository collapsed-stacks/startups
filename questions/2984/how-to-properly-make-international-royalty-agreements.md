We are developers creating a mobile app and we would like to use copyrighted material provided by many companies all around the world (US, Japan, Germany, ...).

Our main concern is about how to make royalty agreements with such companies. If they were in the same country as us (France) it wouldn't be a problem, but with companies in so many different countries we have no idea what to do.

How will they trust us? We have almost no guarantees to offer. These companies are also rather small and are probably not used to receive royalties for what they do, so I don't expect them to come up with some kind of pre-made contract. Any help on the technical side of things is welcome.

(Another concern is about how to negociate such royalties, but I guess this requires some research.)

<p>There are a few solutions to this problem.</p>

<p>Firstly, there are local royalty/licensing companies which have the right to distribute the copyrighted materials. They have a portfolio of materials from various companies. So you can find some of those companies in your country and view their portfolio. Other than viewing you can get in contact with them and try to arrange the agreement through their network.</p>

<p>Secondly, there is a global network called <a href="https://www.lesi.org/" rel="nofollow">Licensing Executives Society International</a>, find its branch in your country and contact them. Their job is to help you out and also In their websites there are templates on how to make what kind of agreements and so on.</p>

<p>Thirdly, you can find a local lawyer firm which has experience in this field and do the agreement with their help.</p>

<p>All in all, don't do it by yourself, make sure you have someone experienced in this field helping you out.</p>
