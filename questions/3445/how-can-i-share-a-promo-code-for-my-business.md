I have frequently seen, when shopping online, that websites say "enter promotional code" to get a discount. These promo codes are available at websites such as retailmenot.com and coupnduniya.in.

1. How are these companies able to get their promotional codes on these websites?

2. How would I go about contacting them to add a promo-code for my business?

Typically users of the site submit the promo codes to sites like retailmenot.com. Codes may be obtained through whatever channels the seller uses to disseminate the codes--for example, magazine ads, email lists, facebook, and twitter.
