<p>I am running a company which offers a teachers' portal for personal educations.</p>

<p>We have a homepage, and you can tell, where in a country whose population is decreasing, the size of the market of the personal education (teaching) decreases. So the rivals also do SEO stuff but I think it is like a cat and mouse game.</p>

<p>Does anybody here have original and unique idea in order to make your homepage shown up after the potential customers google?</p>

<p>Here are a few ideas short of hiring an SEO firm:</p>

<ol>
<li>Master English spelling and grammar if you have English on your HP (if not, disregard). This does affect Google ranking in several subtle ways, and for your target customer it would also be important.</li>
<li>Provide something that is worth linking to - great information or free stuff. More people linking to you = better ranking and more natural traffic.</li>
<li>Offer courses for bloggers to give away to their readers.</li>
<li>Make sure your homepage and landing pages load fast. Google does check that and customers won't wait a second for your page to load.</li>
</ol>

<p>Also remember, if they are looking for your type of service on Google, they are going to click on several options very quickly. What may be more important than being on top is having a homepage that tells them they have found what they are looking for. Make whatever you offer really easy to find in the first second that they look at your page.</p>
