I am currently looking for some online services that would allow me to pay my customers directly into their bank accounts easily. Ideally it would support multiple currencies and countries. PayPal comes to mind, but I like having a few alternatives. What other options are there?

<p>The company i work for has to pay hundreds of employees spread across the world, online we use <a href="http://www.payoneer.com/" rel="nofollow">payaneer</a> and paypal, if someone doesn't have paypay they will be able to get payaneer, i think if you have a large group of people to provide a payment service for then you should provide alternatives.</p>
