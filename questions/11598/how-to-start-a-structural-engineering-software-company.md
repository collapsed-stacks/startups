<p>I have been working in the industry for several years and I find a lot of flaws in some of the structural analysis FEM software that I use daily. Yet, for some reason, we still use these engineering software because we are merely used to them and we "trust" them.   </p>

<p>That got me to think: why isn't there any better software out there? Why can't I make one?</p>

<p>How can the new software be competitive against more well-established software?
Should I start learning how to code or is it better to find someone who is more of an expert in CS/computer programming?  I suppose learning how to program FEM is very difficult..</p>

<p>It sounds like you have significant barriers to entry - you cannot code &amp; you do not know someone who can. I will make the assumption that you do not have lots of cash to get going?</p>

<p>This is not meant to sound too critical, but just for you to understand the challenge. I would suggest a completely different approach. As you do not have the above, build a specification for a new system. Go into exhaustive detail covering every part. Identify the limitations of existing systems and give real-life examples (best if they are other people's/prospective buyers). Then work out the size of the market. </p>

<p>Once you have these two, approach software houses that may be interested in developing this and giving you a small share (make sure you get them to sign a non-disclosure agreement before you share your details/knowledge). Good luck!</p>

<p>I've been in this situation with engineering software I've used. You <strong><em>know</em></strong> that a decent programmer could write something that does that functionality better in a couple of weeks, right? </p>

<p>If you've never written a substantial piece of software before <strong><em>for others' consumption</em></strong>, you should know that the core functionality is generally 10% of the coding work (homepage, data munging, all the front-end widgets, styling, interactivity, user account creation+management, access control, database architecture, deployment &amp; provisioning, server maintenance...), and the coding work is generally like 50%Â±20%  of the total work required to receive money in exchange (sales and marketing, legal, outsourcing).</p>

<p>So the two weeks actually required to create the <strong><em>software</em></strong> that solves the core problem is in fact only 5% of the work required to create the <strong><em>business system</em></strong> that transforms the software into money. I.e. you're looking at like a year of FTE work to have a sustainable business.</p>

<p>Most people opt to reduce this time and risk by:</p>

<ul>
<li>working 80hr weeks (so now you're down to 6 months)</li>
<li>being a proficient programmer or having a cofounder who is</li>
<li>validating an MVP (so you create just the core functionality and babysit users who are desperate to use it to verify that it does solve a real need) in the first 2 months.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some people opt to keep the security of their day job until the MVP is validated, thus spreading those 2 MVP months out over 6-12.</p>

<p>And, all this assumes that the competitive circumstances are such that the competition wouldn't respond credibly/quickly, and your business would succeed! Hopefully that explains why it's obvious that the core problem could be solved quickly, but few embark upon commercialising the solution.</p>

<p>The way to start a structural software engineering company is to <strong>start a structural software engineering blog</strong>.</p>

<p>Your validation question is, <em>do people who use this software care about the problems?</em> So MVP is whatever gets you talking to users. And a great way to get there is to write. Don't write, "here's what's wrong," but, "here's what I do to work around problem X." </p>

<p>If you can establish an audience, you can work step by step towards finding the most common problems, which will help you spec out a software MVP that will solve just the biggest hassle, beautifully.</p>

<p>Who will write the software? <strong>If you've validated demand, you'll have no trouble finding a risk partner.</strong></p>
