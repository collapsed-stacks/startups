<p>I have been going through a <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2363658" rel="nofollow">research paper</a>, which has the following line here:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The ability to select among revenue streams has broadened and
  complicated a decision previously restricted to pricing. First, for
  many firms, the choice between revenue models involves trade-offs that
  arise because increasing revenue from one source (e.g. subscription)
  most often reduces revenue from an alternative source (e.g.
  advertising or the sale of user information)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Why does this happen?</strong> How does one revenue stream compete with each other?</p>

<p>The example you provided is pretty common with digital goods. As an example, I'll use mobile apps:</p>

<ol>
<li>The "free" version of the app comes with ads</li>
<li>The "paid" version of the app removes the ads</li>
</ol>

<p>The more incentive you give for users to purchase your app, the more "subscription" revenue you receive, but those purchases reduce your ad revenue.</p>

<p>Another example is Microsoft:</p>

<ol>
<li>Annual subscription to MS Office </li>
<li>Sell a licensed copy of MS Office</li>
</ol>

<p>More licensed sales could lead to fewer subscription sales. </p>

<p>There are many examples that are similar, but the point is that the proper selection of revenue model (pricing, terms, etc.) can lead to dramatically different results. </p>

<p>Let's consider the examples described in the text you cite: <strong><em>subscription</em></strong> vs. <strong><em>advertising</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Some sites, apps, etc. first offer you a free version (to encourage you to try it) in order to maximize downloads. But the free version contains ads which somewhat degrade your user experience. This is the <strong>advertising</strong> model at work.</p>

<p>Then, while you are using the free version, they will offer you a <strong><em>no ads</em></strong> version that requires you to pay a fee. This is the <strong>subscription</strong> model at work.</p>

<p>If you purchase the subscription, you are paying the app maker to turn off the ads. And whatever other features they might or might not add to your experience.</p>

<p>That's how the two models compete with each other. Turn on the subscription to turn off the ads.</p>
