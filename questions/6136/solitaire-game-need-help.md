I recently released my first html game. It's a simple solitaire game that can be played right in the browser on both web and mobile.

Web version doesn't use any monetization technique, mobile version is monetized by ads.
Mobile version is downloaded about 100 times each day. Web version has about 10 new users each day.

I’m kind of stuck with the future strategy. I don’t know what to do next… Probably because there are too many things to do =(

I don’t know if it’s better to focus on one platform and provide more features like game score (leaderboard), in-app purchase, internal notifications etc... or develop an app for different platforms (play (google) store, amazon, window, baidu etc.) or move to the social networks (facebook etc.)

And I don’t know which type of monetization to choose:
1. In-app purchase themes (cards, backgrounds etc...) 
2. Ads subscription (remove ads)
3. Limited number of games which can be played in certain period of time with possibility to buy “life”.
4. Paid return (back) button.

I would be very grateful if someone gave me a piece of advice.

Thank you in advance!

>  better to I don’t know if it’s better to focus on one platform and provide more features focus on one platform

Each strategy have good and bad things, I can't say what's the better for you 
You must know what is your **final target**. But just keep in mind if you focus on a lot of things you will end up not accomplished anything.

My opinion is to focus on one platform, when you are satisfied with the result move to other one.

Mobile apps grows up so fast more than websites, 

"Case study"
Angry bird they start on Iphones, with simple game, not a lot of feature was there, after they have a lot of fans they move to other platform, after they success they start to add feature with different funny versions.

> And I don’t know which type of monetization to choose: 1. In-app purchase themes (cards, backgrounds etc...) 2. Ads subscription (remove ads) 3. Limited number of games which can be played in certain period of time with possibility to buy “life”. 4. Paid return (back) button.

1- I will not pay for background.

2-I will not pay for removing ads because simply I can turn off the Wifi or the data. 

3-maybe I will pay for life.

Don't take my answer as final one, don't forget your fans have different opinions, I am just one of them, some people hate ads, others not. so there is no final answer for this. make a study

My feedback about the website

 - Clean 9/10 but a little boring for that I take 1 points out.
 - not complicated 10/10
 - easy domain to remember 8/10, 2 points out for ".net" and "."
 - no bugs or errors 10/10
 - for the theme options 10/10 I love that
 - for saving history and continue the game later 10/10 amazing!

If you stuck at feature! make a survey, you will be amazed by the result, do what exactly your fans want, good luck :) just leave me alone now I want to play a game there..

<p>You want to figure out the next strategy but the things you have described aren't related to strategy. They are tactical or operational decisions.</p>

<p>A strategy might sound like this: <code>I will get featured in the AppStore</code> or <code>I will grow to 1000 downloads in the next 3 months</code> or <code>I will grow my revenue by 10% each weak</code>.</p>

<p>When you have a clear strategy then you can start to think about how you will achieve it, that is the tactics. When you defined a clear goal you can start asking questions such as what feature would increase my download? Or, what feature would increase my revenues? and so on.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>What I was trying to lead you towards is for you to figure out what exactly do you want to achieve with this app. If your main goal is to make money you need to figure out what monetization technique will bring you the most amount of money and implement it.</p>

<p>I suggest you choose ads if your target audience is not in Japan or France. Here is why:</p>

<a href="http://venturebeat.com/2014/03/27/mobile-app-monetization-freemium-is-king-but-in-app-ads-are-growing-fast/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Source</a></p>

<p>From there on your focus should be on just growing your downloads. Ask one question: What feature will increase my downloads the most? and do that.</p>

In my humble opinion you should focus on your current platforms because people still discover find out on App store and also on web. So I think you should more focus to get lot more users to your current platforms and after time expand on another platforms like you mention. 

I have taken a close look on your game iOS version and also on web. Game is really good right (now speak as a iOS Developer) it has smooth design and also icon is pretty. According to your question implement in-app purchases is really great idea but you must to think about it really hard and don't put there some bad in-app like microsoft did with their windows 10 version of solitaire(pay to removed ads).  I suggest you to make some free features maybe implement some game currency, while people are playing it often they might earn some for example coins and later buy some special decks of card or something like this. You can make some popup box with ad and this is really great system because user can decide if he watch ad and after ad he will earn some reward or not. You should create some new type of games and sell it as an in-app. 

On the other hand you should get some reviews from your players which could influence game position in app store which might help to get lot more players to your game and monetize much more money.

For website I suggest you to create some login system and also add some new type of games which can user buy.

@narzan He is right you should create some survey to find out what your user likes and what they want. You will see exactly what they want and scale your product for making more money. 

1. In-apps in mobile app are really important they might be a really good source of money.
2. With Ad Subscription might be a little problem because right now you have only one smaller banner in app which is not disappointing in fact and adding Ads to your website it's not such a good idea because of ad blocker and so on. (Without ads it looks really nice :) )
3. It might be good idea.
4. Paid button is not good idea maybe when you choose some like pack of 10 returns. It might be better solution for user to pay for it and you to make money from that user.

You made really great work with this. I really like because it works really smooth in responsive design which is totally awesome.
