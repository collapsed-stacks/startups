In the UK, does a shareholder in a startup have a right to ask about complete details of the company's cashflow? (who earns what salary, how much money is paid for the office, etc)

What rights a shareholder has should be documented in the shareholder agreement and other documents.

However it's usual practice to send out a monthly 'executive report' to shareholders which should give them a monthly overview of what they need to know.

That includes cash flow, sales, marketing, update on actions taken that month. Anything else agreed on that should be regularly reported.
