I have been working on my own software startup idea (a web-based rpg game) for some time and have developed a functional prototype. I'd like to start having people beta test it to gauge its viability, but would like to add more polish to make a good first impression. 

So I'm at the point where I need to start bringing on help to bring it over the finish line. This is the first time I've attempted to create a team for a startup concept and am unsure how to proceed. I'm hoping someone can provide clarity on the following:

- I'm having my first meeting to share the project today with a new dev and design resource. Today will just be to give an overview of the project and see where they can help out. What initial considerations should I think about before bringing on help? Do I need to have rules laid out for ownership of any content they produce? 

- New dev resource: What technical protection considerations and/or docs (NDAs, etc) should I have in place before giving them access to the Github repo? 

- New design resource: What's a good repo/method for storing game assets that protect current game assets?

- What other resources are crucial to get the beta test production ready? 

I am a bit nervous to bring others on as I've been working by myself building everything for quite some time. So any other suggestions on getting started with a new team would be very helpful.

I'm not sure if this question belongs on SO, or some other SO subsite. Please advise if it belongs elsewhere.

I am at a similar stage as you are in. Here is what I have decided - 

(i) start with a test / trial project - a small measurable project - we get to know each other. Non-technical this project may drag out over say few weeks; whereas if it is technical you can agree to pay the other person cash or equivalent convertible notes. This helps especially if the other person does not join you and he has delivered some code that you may end up using. 

(ii) NDA IMO is not a good idea at this stage. It is important to have NDA when they join your company, but not this early in discussion. At this stage can you hide details and instead decide on the interface that he/she will work to and you integrate the submission into your codebase. IMO no github for this small measurable project.

(iii) You need to consider similar issues such as copyright for the design work that gets done as part of the small measurable project.

(iv) testing and operations staff is very critical.
