I am looking to onboard new users by walking them through the product and answer their questions ,fix bugs etc.

I'm looking for any tips, tools that can be of use to me. 

I want to not worry about long distance usage. Skype would be ideal but I am also curious about the google hangouts dialer...I just don't know what my google hangouts dialer number is otherwise I would use it.
