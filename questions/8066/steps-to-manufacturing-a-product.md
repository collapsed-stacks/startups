<p>One of the things that has always confused me about some startups that offer a product rather than a service is how they actually go about <strong>creating</strong> the product..</p>

<p>For instance, clothing, accessories (watches, wallets, purses), certain tech, etc - How do these entrepreneurs make what they draw on a piece of paper a reality? Are there certain manufacturing companies that you need to get in touch with? How do you know they wont just take your idea and run with it?</p>

<p>My experience comes from manufacturing consumer products.</p>

<p>Standard processes includes the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Product Design - generate 3D renderings that appeal to your customer base (after you've validated who the target customer is)</li>
<li>Mechanical and Electrical Design - Mechanical design will mimic the 3D rendering; Electrical will build components that fit within the mechanical constraints.</li>
<li>Prototype - Additive Manufacturing and PCB Batches do well here - this process is highly iterative. Continue to tweak mechanical and electric design based off of consumer/engineering feedback</li>
<li>After prototyping is complete, considering reaching out to multiple manufacturers for vetting - this process can take months depending on the volumes that you're seeking</li>
<li>Select contract manufacturer based off vetting process</li>
<li>Tooling &amp; batch runs- develop tooling and testing jigs for production (again, an iterative process). Note that flaws will still be discovered in this phase but hopefully mistakes are minimized due to Step 3</li>
<li>Production Run - Mass manufacturing</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that this is a high-level approach - you'll still have to deal with fulfillment, certification (e.g FCC, UL), etc..</p>

<p>As add-on to kidlogic's answer:</p>

<ol>
<li>You can get help for any of the above steps ... there are product designers (mechanical, industrial, 'designers', etc...), prototyping firms (machine/3d-print/etc like ProtoMold, or more full-service firms like the company I work for).</li>
<li>Contract manufacturers - sometimes you can find a one-stop-shop, or you can 'subcontract' out the various pieces to multiple different shops. Usually the one-stop shops are pricier ... but you usually have a greater likelihood of them getting the job done with less headache on your part.</li>
<li>You haven't touched on IP ... if you're going to outside <strong><em>ANYTHING</em></strong>, you want to make sure you've addressed IP concerns -- copyright? trade secrets? patent applications for anything patentable? Make sure you use NDA's (non-disclosure agreements) ... but while they help, they are far, far from fail-safe.</li>
</ol>
