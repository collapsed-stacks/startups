I am an Indian looking to start my venture from Singapore to target APAC. 

How much time would it take to register the company and what is the complexity in paper work? 

We have been selected for Incubation in a startup accelerator program. I would like to know the process of company registration. Do i need a local guy as a founder for the same?  

The Incubator might have its own process but i want to know the best way to go for such an incubation in singapore. 

It will be fresh Software company and would be headquartered in Singapore

I'm based in Singapore. The main guide for business here is Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) website. I've pulled out some links below.
