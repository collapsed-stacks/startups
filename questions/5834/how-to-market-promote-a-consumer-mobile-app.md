<p>I have a mobile app that I want to publish in the coming weeks. What are the effective ways of promoting a consumer mobile app?
Think of the app as something like EverNote.</p>

<p>Options that I can think of are</p>

<ol>
<li>App store landing page</li>
<li>Facebook ads</li>
<li>Google search ads</li>
</ol>

<p>As a one person company I don't have much resources to try out different approaches and figure the right way out through try and fail.</p>

<p>This is a very broad question and in general the marketing strategy strongly depends on the target audience your app focuses on.</p>

<p>But the one thing you should do for sure is to optimize the app store listing page of your app. Afaik the app icon is very crucial. You can find more about <strong>App Store Optimization</strong> in the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/app-store-optimization-podcast/id588960862?mt=2" rel="nofollow">App Store Optization Podcast</a>, although the podcast might be discontinued.</p>

<p>I would not go with Facebook ads and Google search ads, since</p>

<ul>
<li>the customer lifetime value of your app probably won't justify the costs of running ads</li>
<li>you've essentially burning money until you see some success</li>
</ul>

<p>If your app isn't niched down yet, it would be definitely an advantage marketing-wise to do so. E.g. by being "the number one note taking app for real estate agents"</p>

<p>Since you don't have too much money to spend, try: </p>

<ul>
<li>Visiting <strong>local events</strong> (e.g. meetups) that are somehow related to
what    your product/service does. You'll get <em>potential</em> first users
and    valuable feedback.</li>
<li>Look for <strong>niche websites</strong> which cover topics that your Target Audience
might find useful. Contact the website/editor and explain how your
app is different from what is available today.</li>
</ul>
