<p>Step in to your customers shoes for a while, and go thru how valuable your product is to them.</p>

<p>If it saves them time, lets say 10 hours, it's worth paying 5 hours cost because they still make profit out of it. </p>

<p>If it adds sales for 100k a year, its definitely worth of paying 10k a year.</p>

<p>If you can't come up with these numbers, you're not ready to sell.</p>

<p>There will be no definitive answer for this as pricing can be very tricky and the outcome can vary wildly.</p>

<h1>Unique vs non-unique software</h1>

<p>First of all, have a look at what the competition is doing. If you are developing software that already exists, you should already have a good sense of what the competition charges and what features they offer. Compare your product to theirs. if yours has more features, then in <em>theory</em> you can charge more. If your product has less features than theirs, well, then you charge less.</p>

<p>If your software is truly unique (very rare), then you have the freedom to charge what you like and what you feel is a fare amount.</p>

<h1>Pricing high vs pricing low</h1>

<p>Pricing high can create the expectation that the product is of high quality and sort after. However, if you price high and your software looks bad (UI) and performs poorly, be prepared for a high refund rate. In short, you require a good reputation in order to price your product high.</p>

<p>Pricing low can help gain entry to market, however you create the expectation that you are the cheap alternative and people will expect less from your product.</p>

<p>There are a huge number of resources on the internet with regards to pricing. Pricing is very dynamic and depends on a number of items</p>

<ul>
<li>The product</li>
<li>competition</li>
<li>market conditions</li>
<li>supply and demand</li>
<li>perceived value</li>
<li>geography</li>
<li>your costs</li>
<li>your business' financial state (survival, growing, leader)</li>
<li>many more</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>At the end of the day, the user will only pay for something if the expected value they will receive outweighs the money they are prepared to part with.</em></strong></p>
