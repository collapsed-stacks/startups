I came up with an interesting idea. But to develop this idea I need a team of at least 5 engineers (next to me). We are at the very beginning of the development. We are trying to develop a prototype to demonstrate everything in order to atract investors and eventually get funded. However the engineers that surround me are more experienced and skilled than me.
So far everybody is contributing and paying a litlle part of the necessary expenses. So if some material is needed we will all contribute to reach the needed amount of money.

What could I do to make sure I don't get surpassed by the other engineers and I am still considered as the "founder" or person who is responsible for the whole project? I can't differentiate myself by my engineering skills.

I am afraid that after a certain time they might say something like: "He is useless. We can do everything he does by ourselves, we actually don't need him"

You should be managing the company/business and let engineer work on the development. This way you divide the responsibility. By taking responsibility of bringing business/customers/money, you also contribute to the "existence" of the company.

Do not worry too much about people leaving you. Create a great product and happy work culture and let people think that this is collective ownership. 

Finally as a thumb rule if key people leave then you have failed at all of above, in which case you should become passive owner and let someone else manage.

I think rather than worrying about something like that, you should focus on trying to create the best environment possible for the people working for you. I think most people who are escaping the 9-5 grind is to find positive people and great environment where their skills and ideas can flourish.

Also, I think if they are really good at building software, chances are that there are things that they don't want to think about or consider, and the reason that they work for you is because they would like someone who shows leadership and can take care of the business side of things.

Having said all of that, if you create a culture that is open, progressive and allows everyone to contribute to each others' professional development, I don't think you will have much to worry about.
