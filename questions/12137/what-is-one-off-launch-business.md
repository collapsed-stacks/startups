Could you please let me know What is one-off launch business? Can you bring example? Thanks in advance.

I have read it in this paragraph:
Businesses that are successful in the long term generally have a predictable revenue model. Those categorized by huge peaks and troughs, one-off launches, and up-and-down months are far more difficult.

<p>I think, it does not refer to the business itself, rather than to the kind of business model the company follows. It means, that you have projects that you do for an individual customer, which pays you <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/one-off" rel="nofollow noreferrer">only once</a> upon completion. This stands in opposite to a service offer, where you generate ongoing or recurrent revenues from a single customer by providing continuous services, e.g. on a monthly or yearly plan.</p>

<p>One example, where it's used in this sense is <a href="http://www.businessitessentials.com/one-off-job" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
