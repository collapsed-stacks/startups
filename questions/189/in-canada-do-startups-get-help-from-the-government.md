<p>I live in Canada and I am planning to create my own startup in the next years (a small indie game studio). I think I've heard somewhere that the government helps startups by giving them money so they don't go bankrupt from the start, but I am not sure this is true or not.</p>

<p>If it is true, what would I need to do to get help from the government.</p>

<p>P.S. If it can help, I am living in the province of Quebec.</p>

<p>There are a lot of grants and other sources of governmental financial help for startups. Most of them you do have to individually apply for them. I'm not familiar with Quebec specific ones - being at the opposite end of the country myself and having really sucky French - however for I am fairly familiar with Canadian government tax benefits. Most benefits you have to manually apply for however there are some that are very easy to get:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/hiringcredit/">HCSB</a> (Hiring Credit for Small Businesses): Gives a credit up to $1000 on the employer portion of any <em>increase</em> in ei premiums from last year. Currently unconfirmed for 2014 but has been active for the last 3 years. Application is simple... you don't have to do anything beyond your normal filing of T4 slips and summary which you have to do anyways.</p></li>
<li><p>For partnerships and proprietorships on your <em>personal income tax</em> (form <strong>T2125</strong>) you can claim significant "use of home" expences - comensurate to whatever you figure is how much of the house you use mainly for business purposes - a common amount to claim is 10%. This reduces your <em>net</em> income. On that you can claim mortgage, hydro, heating, insurance, and maintenance among others but reducing your taxable income by 10% of your mortgage and heating etc. sure can help when you are starting out.</p></li>
<li><p>Employees can also claim some of those costs under more stringent rules and with a signed form from their employer.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Take a look at <a href="http://www.canadabusiness.ca/eng/page/2740/">this page</a>. There are tons of grants you have your business apply for in Canada. They all have different requirements, so see which ones fit your business best.</p>
