<p>I tried my best to contact Domain Development Corp which is the owner of ddc.com, but I failed. I  found its contact info on its websites new.com and ddc.com. I tried both 424.237.2093  and  info@ddc.com,but no one answered the call and no one replied to my email. I also tried a lot of other ways, but I failed every time. I am a Chinese girl located in China. I am not familiar with American society at all. Could you please tell me how to get its valid contact info? I will appreciate your kind help. Looking forward getting your response.</p>

<p>Snail mail usually gets your attention.</p>

<p>You might also be luckier with their domain's <a href="http://www.whois.com/whois/ddc.com" rel="nofollow">whois record</a>.</p>

<p>And try LinkedIn if you know the name of employees there.</p>

<p><a href="https://uniregistry.com/whois" rel="nofollow">https://uniregistry.com/whois</a></p>

<p>Then enter the domain name ddc.com and you will get the details.</p>
