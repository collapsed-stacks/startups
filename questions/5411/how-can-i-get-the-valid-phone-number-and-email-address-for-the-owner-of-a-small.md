I tried my best to contact Domain Development Corp which is the owner of ddc.com, but I failed. I  found its contact info on its websites new.com and ddc.com. I tried both 424.237.2093  and  info@ddc.com,but no one answered the call and no one replied to my email. I also tried a lot of other ways, but I failed every time. I am a Chinese girl located in China. I am not familiar with American society at all. Could you please tell me how to get its valid contact info? I will appreciate your kind help. Looking forward getting your response.

Snail mail usually gets your attention.

You might also be luckier with their domain's [whois record](http://www.whois.com/whois/ddc.com).

And try LinkedIn if you know the name of employees there.

Then enter the domain name ddc.com and you will get the details.

Here is what I found
