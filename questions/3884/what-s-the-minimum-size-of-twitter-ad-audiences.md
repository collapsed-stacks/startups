I'm trying to use Twitter Ads audiences to target some of my advertisements but all the audiences I created so far are too small. I tried searching Twitter's documentation but I couldn't find the minimum audience size.

What's the minimum size?

<h2>Per <a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/20172494-why-arent-my-ads-receiving-impressions#" rel="nofollow">Twitter</a>:</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Audience size too small</strong></p>
  
  <p>If you have uploaded a Tailored Audience list that has an audience
  size that is deemed “too small” your campaign will not run.</p>
  
  <p>In the case that the matched audience is below the minimum tailored
  audience size of 500 active Twitter users, make sure that the original
  upload size is several times larger. It often takes thousands of
  entries just to match 500 users.</p>
  
  <p>Another potential solution is reach expansion, which lets an
  advertiser expand the reach of their campaign through lookalike
  modeling. Reach expansion is useful when the audience is relatively
  small, or any time an advertiser wants to drive more volume with their
  campaigns.</p>
  
  <p>Reach expansion is optional, and can be toggled on and off by the
  advertiser in Twitter Ads at will, for both new and currently-running
  campaigns. It is toggled on and off by checking the “Expand audiences”
  checkbox near the audience selector in the campaign UI.</p>
