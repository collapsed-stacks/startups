<p>Stripe is not officially available in the country of my citizenship and residence (Russia). The country is not in <a href="https://stripe.com/global" rel="nofollow">the list of supported countries</a>.</p>

<p>I have signed up and configured the SDK to work with my app and like how it runs in test mode. Now I wonder if I register my company in a supported country, like Finland, what documents will Stripe require from me to prove I run a legal company?</p>

<p>Where can I find more information about the procedure of registering me as an eligible client in Stripe?</p>

<p>I also have had a look at Braintree which doesn't support my country also.</p>

<p>Can it help if I have Payoneer virtual bank account, or what are options available to use legally a payment service if have no business in a supported country?</p>

<p>Stripe has recently launched <a href="https://stripe.com/atlas" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Stripe Atlas</a> which, if you are accepted, allows you to create an American company which will then allow you to make use of the Stripe platform. If you're approved the whole process can take only a few days to two weeks.</p>
