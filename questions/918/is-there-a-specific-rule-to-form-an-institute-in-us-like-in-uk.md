In the UK the term "institute" is a protected word and companies or other organizations may only use the word if they are "organisations which are carrying out research at the highest level or to professional bodies of the highest standing", and use of the title "institute" requires approval from the Secretary of State. Failure to seek approval is a criminal offence. 

Is there any similar rule in US?

<p>First, just for completeness, here's the <a href="http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/about/gbhtml/gp1.shtml" rel="nofollow">source</a> and full text of your reference to the UK's regulation of the term "institute":</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Approval to use this word is normally given only to fully functioning
  organisations that are established in the field but operate under a
  different name.  The range of activities may vary but institutes are
  organisations that typically undertake research at the highest level
  or are professional bodies of the highest standing. The factors we
  will take into account include:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>whether there is a good reason for establishing the institute</li>
  <li>whether the activities are regulated or unregulated</li>
  <li>whether the organisation already exists in some form</li>
  <li>the nature of any work it provides for other organisations</li>
  <li>the relevance and nature of support from existing organisations</li>
  <li>whether the institute offers training leading to its own qualifications</li>
  <li>whether the institute provides training or activities that support qualifications provided by other bodies such as universities or
  colleges</li>
  <li>whether the institute's activities are supported by or associated with activities undertaken by a government body, an independent
  organisation established in the field or a funding organisation</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>You will need to obtain the written views (letter or email) of one or
  more relevant bodies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>As for the regulation of the term in the United States, no it's use is not regulated, and it's use in trade names is very common.</strong></p>
