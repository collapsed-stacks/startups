<p>I have an idea for startup, I am programmer and I know how to execute most of this idea. Also there is no problem for me to learn new stuff. </p>

<p>But I also know that it is almost impossible to do it all right alone. So I need people for my startup team. But where do I find people if I cannot offer any starting money? Also perfect would to find people who share the vision, etc.</p>

<p>You are fortunate in that you are a technical person. Business and designers are easier to find. Generally, it is best to build something and start pushing it and people will want to join your team. I would be happy to get on a call with you as I have experienced similar things in building my company www.fb.com/SmartyPantsApp</p>
