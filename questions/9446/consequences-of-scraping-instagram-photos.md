Say, I want to build an app to search for car images by model, years, etc… I’m thinking to scrape tons of the car images from Instagram. Note that I won't be saving any images, but just the links to the images. I already applied my app for review but it is not accepted. My app won’t be commercial anytime soon. I will cache those images for one week and then refresh them to see if the owners have set them to private so my app will not display those, etc...

Will Instagram sue me, etc…?

The photos on Instagram are owned by the users. In a case like this you would have to get permission from the owners of the photo, the people who posted them, because they might be the ones that could file a lawsuit. Try to embed the photos in your application instead using Instagram. Also take a look at their API to see what they offer. However, I do suggest asking the actual owner/photographers for permission first.
