## Is the term sheet the last step before wiring money?

I am trying to understand the anatomy of a typical VC process.

So far I understand there's a first point of contact, usually a junior analyst or Associate partner. Then the deal moves until it can find a "champion" inside the firm. Usually a Partner, Venture partner or General Partner.

This "champion" will do a long due diligence with the entrepreneur before calling in the final investment meeting. Where an actual decision is taken.

If the meeting is successful, a term sheet is issued.

Is that the last step ? Is there some more due diligence after that ? (Like technical due diligence, legal due diligence or this kind of stuff...)

Thanks !

There's a pre term sheet and post term sheet due diligence.

Post term-sheet is more legal and accounting. Just to check there's no hidden problem.

The post term-sheet due diligence can take anywhere from 10 days to a month (or so I've heard...)
