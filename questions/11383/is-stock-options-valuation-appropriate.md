<p>I have been given an offer in which the company says</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You will get options equvilent  to .15% of the valuation that we rise in our seed round at,with a value cap of 15k$ . </p>
</blockquote>

<p>What does this exactly mean?</p>

<p>I know this question is a bit speculative but Am I paying too much for stock options? </p>
