Is there a way for me to obtain telemarketing contact details without spending a fortune on expensive data lists?

If it's for an in-house marketer for a quick B2B market study, the yellow pages work fine, as does google local search, or plain googling businesses by sector.

If it's to feed numbers to an offsite/outsourced team or to call consumers, three points:

1. The price of the lists you're looking into might be lower than you think: see how long it'll take you to compile the same information using the phone book.

2. That price (normally) includes stripping out numbers on do not call lists for you -- which is to say over half of US households if cursory googling is anything to go by.

3. A 1% conversion rate is generally accepted as standard when telesales are cold-calling households (or so it was 10 years ago, anyway). That is to say, it barely works.
