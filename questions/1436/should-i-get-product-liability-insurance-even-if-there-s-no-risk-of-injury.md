I'm planning on selling a non-critical replacement part for a power tool. The part works with several brands and it's low cost, just $15. I don't plan on selling it through major retailers, only directly. 

I have a fear that if a customer is injured by the power tool, I may be exposed to a costly lawsuit even though my product had nothing to do with it. The manufacturer of the tool could easily blame my product as the culprit.

Should I get product liability insurance? Will it protect me from the catastrophic legal costs due to a frivolous lawsuit?

Sounds to me like you've answered your own question. I would say that given your replacement part is a component in a product that is notorious for causing injuries, it's best you protect your business with insurance. Even if your part is non-critical.

Though your part may not be a key safety feature, like the safety guard on a circular saw, strange things can happen with power tools that can lead to injuries.
