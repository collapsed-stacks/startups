<p>I am working on build a community website to help the idea owner find a place where he can post his idea and get feedback from the people or up/down votes.
this can consider as first impression, then if he see there good reaction from the people maybe he can keep going with his idea to convert it to a project.</p>

<p>This site is not for raise funding or ask questions about the startups.
It is only for get feedback and votes </p>

<p><strong>The problem is</strong>
My friends that i consider them as early adopters told me that there is no big value you give to the users.</p>

<p>So. how can i give that value to my end users </p>

<p>just in case to check that site <code>ideacloudi.com</code></p>

<p>At the start of a business, it's common to "stack the deck" a little bit. For example, during the launch of the popular dating app Tinder, the marketers first made a pitch to a college sorority. They told the young women that Tinder would be a fun and easy way to flirt, and to exert their independence. Those young women were the first people to sign up.</p>

<p>The marketers of Tinder then went to a fraternity at the same college, with a different pitch: they told all those guys that these sorority girls were waiting for them on Tinder.  All the guys signed up.</p>

<p>For your community, it would help to get a few experienced business experts as the first members. If you are in the United States, you might be able to enlist some retired executives through the Small Business Administration. Many of them have a group of volunteers in S.C.O.R.E. ("Service Corps of Retired Executives") who would be happy to advise.</p>

<p>Anyway, once you get some experienced, successful people as your first members, make sure to show their resumes / accomplishments.  People with less experience will want to learn from those experienced people, and will sign up. (In theory, anyway.)</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Value is the measure of how well you are solving a real problem.</p>

<p>Your idea is a clone of the stack exchange, reddit, and a bunch of QA sites out there. What about your product sets it apart from others? That's where the value is.</p>

<p>How can you get people <strong>better</strong> feedback than they would get in some other website? That's what I would focus on. If they answer is not <strong>clear</strong>, I'd focus my time on something else until it is.</p>

<p>I find this hard to provide a proof that will validate an startup idea. </p>

<p>generally the only way to validate with the market is by introducing your product or contacting experts in the field that can provide you feedback of your product. (just like a question I asked)</p>

<p>for that you would require a deeper approach, like offering direct contact with the market and providers, and for that end you would need an agency and not just a site. </p>

<p>maybe what you can do is offer business incubator services online where you will contact expert to provide feedback. </p>

<p>in this aspect you cannot let an open community handle opinions, as I see hard or impossible to target all possible market niches in single space, unless you have everything organized like kickstarter. </p>

<p>I see this as a bridge between kickstarter and stackexchange, a place when you can ask for feedback without starting to invest. but you will need to build a community of both experts and non-experts.</p>

<p>Also remember that entrepreneurs are a little paranoid about their idea being stolen. Making them public can make them feel less secure, and making them private will make them doubt about you. </p>

<p>Now here's my answer as a person with a business idea about your current site:  </p>

<p>I would not use your current platform. </p>

<p>It's not giving me value, for the contrary, is making me feel unsecure about my idea reaching the wrong niche or somebody using it. </p>
