## How can equity be distributed in proportion to work completed?

<p>Determining the amount of equity each person gets can get sticky especially if you're working with friends. </p>

<p>Sometimes, it just so happens, that once the equity split is done - people start working in proportion to their equity instead of working as hard as possible. </p>

<p>Therefore, I was wondering if there was a way to distribute equity in a way that is related to the work completed by each group member? In addition, how does the equation change if one of the founders puts in start up capital?</p>

<p>Thanks a lot for your help!</p>

<p>First off read: <a href="https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/1885/how-much-equity-should-a-partner-with-a-short-term-commitment-be-entitled-to/1886#1886">"Joel's Totally Fair Method to Divide Up The Ownership of Any Startup"</a> because "people start working in proportion to their equity instead of working as hard as possible" is what (imho) it's really about, and it answers your question about investment as a bonus.</p>

<p>Not all agree with Joel, that said, and for all sorts of reasons. <a href="http://foundrs.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Fun example here</a>, which you may actually find useful in your discussions since it's a founder equity calculator.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the key is to be fair -- or more precisely to make it so that it <em>feels</em> fair. If all founders are happy and agree that the way equity split is fair, you're probably good to go. A sure way to make it <em>not</em> feel fair is if some founders end up with a feeling that they're working for another founder's retirement much more than they are for their own.</p>
