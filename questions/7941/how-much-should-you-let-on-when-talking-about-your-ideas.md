I've a good idea, and I've been talking about it at a startup mentorship meetup. I have the urge to talk about the idea with more people - creative contacts in different industries to see if they have any contacts who might be able to help me out, but I sometimes find myself thinking how much should I be letting on here about my idea. Some of the people I'm talking too are in the same line of work and Ive had a situation in the past where someone has, shall we say, been heavily influenced by some of my former work.
