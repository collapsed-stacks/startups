<p>My understanding is that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_entrepreneurship" rel="nofollow">social entrepreneurs</a>' ultimate goal is creating social value, though I've never seen what a "market fit" looks like for a social entrepreneur, or for that matter, the process for achieving this.  What does market fit look like for a social entrepreneur, and what are ways to it reach it?</p>

<p>In short: the life blood of social entrepreneurs is donations.</p>

<p>Your marketing isn't oriented around finding <em>users</em>: there usually is so many more of them than you can possibly take care of them all.</p>

<p>Your marketing focuses instead on finding <em>donors</em>: articulate what you intend to do or what you're doing, and identify make them feel good about it so as to convert potential donors into actual donors.</p>
