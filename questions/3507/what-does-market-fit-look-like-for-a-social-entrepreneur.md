My understanding is that [social entrepreneurs][1]' ultimate goal is creating social value, though I've never seen what a "market fit" looks like for a social entrepreneur, or for that matter, the process for achieving this.  What does market fit look like for a social entrepreneur, and what are ways to it reach it?

In short: the life blood of social entrepreneurs is donations.

Your marketing isn't oriented around finding *users*: there usually is so many more of them than you can possibly take care of them all.

Your marketing focuses instead on finding *donors*: articulate what you intend to do or what you're doing, and identify make them feel good about it so as to convert potential donors into actual donors.
