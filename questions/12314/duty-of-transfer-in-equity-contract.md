I have recently applied for a job position here in Portugal, the company offered me an equity contract, where I should commit my self for x years in exchange of some equity.
My position will be developer in PHP and HTML.

In the contract for equity there is a note, which translate plus/minus in this:

> Duty of transfer (drag along)
> 
> If the founding shareholders (the
> owners) at any time decide to sell their entire shares in the Company
> to a third party, the accession shareholders (in this case myself) is obligated
> to transfer their shares.

> Terms and conditions for accession companions will be able to be different in that
the extent to which will be more advantageous for them.

I definitely should consult a legal expert, but I would like to have your opinion:

- Is this a "standard" in equity contracts for startups?
- Do you think it is fear? Should I negotiate more on this point?

Thanks

Drag along clauses are fairly standard in my experience. 

In my previous company we had drag along clause which meant that if people owning a combined 75% of the shares wanted to sell the company then everyone had to agree and go with the sale.

if you imagine a situation where such a clause did not exist then you could be in a situation where someone with 99% of the shares wanted to sell their company and someone owning 0.1% of the shares saying, "no" and it would stop the deal because they were not 'dragged along'

This clause is not something that I'd personally be concerned about
