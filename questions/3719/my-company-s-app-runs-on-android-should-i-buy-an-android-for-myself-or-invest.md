## My company's app runs on Android. Should I buy an Android for myself, or invest in a dedicated one for the company?

<p>We developed Android first, just because that was where the talent was on our team, and because we wanted to validate the idea before investing in apple products for the developers. We are getting ready to launch the alpha run of our app, and as the non-developer, I don't have an Android that I can personally run the app on. It is very movement intensive and most of it's features are tied to Accelerometer and GPS contexts so running it on a simulator only goes so far. </p>

<p>Should I buy an android for myself and just switch over from my iPhone for now on my personal line or should I get a cheap android and a cheap data plan dedicated to the company? I guess doing both is also an option. </p>

<p>My first reaction was that it doesn't make sense to buy a dedicated line, but there might be a benefit to being able to hand over the phone so another iPhone user for feedback, which I couldn't do with a personal line, because the app works in the context of taking a walk. </p>

<p>The question of what's more convenient is not for us to answer.</p>

<p>There's a benefit in buying a separate phone owned by the company which comes in addition to your personal line: you don't have to pay for it. The company will, and it is a valid business expense. The caveat is that you can only use that phone for business purposes. But that doesn't necessarily have to be the testing, you can also use it as a company phone (i.e.: have a dedicated line for business conversations that doesn't eat up your personal plan), etc.</p>

<p>It is very common for companies developing mobile apps to buy devices for testing purposes. As long as the devices are used for the purpose the company purchased them for and that is a justified business purpose - this is a valid business expense.</p>

<p>If you buy it for your personal line, and will <em>also</em> use it for testing - it may be very hard to justify the company paying for it, both the device and the data plan. So you'll have to pay from your own money. But in this case, if you leave the company you get to keep the device (and the plan).</p>

<p><strong>Eat Your Own Dog Food</strong></p>

<p>There is a significant amount of incite that comes with experiencing your product first hand, the same way that your potential customers will experience your product. If you are serious about vetting your work or the work of your developers, you must experience it yourself, or empower others who can/have used your product to make decisions.</p>

<p><strong>Creative Problem Solving</strong></p>

<p>What are the specific requirements?  GPS?, DATA? DEVICE OS?<br />
Do not lump the requirements together, else you will limit your ability to solve problems.  For instance, do you need a contract?  Can you use a Pay-as-You-Go Phone? Calling card? Does it have to be the most current OS (as writing this Pi Day '15 - Android Lollipop).  Buying a used or refurbished phone might meet the needs of the requirements, and it may not be necessary to mettle with the frustration of change mobile contracts. </p>

<p><strong>Being Versatile</strong></p>

<p>If you plan releasing the application on multiple devices/platforms, you should (as a best practice) familiarize your self with each platform that your product comes out on. Step into the avatar of that market share for a moment, and raise concern that they might have.  It would be a bad idea for director to release a film in 3D if they have never experienced a 3D film.  Don't be afraid to be flexible.  Education and experience can be cheap, but the investment into your self and your product are priceless.</p>
