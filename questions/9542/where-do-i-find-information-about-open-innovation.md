To start with, if this is not the correct stack exchange site I apologize.  It's the closest I could find.  I would be happy to transfer to another site that is more appropriate if one exists.

I manage a division for a technical engineering services firm.  We have been asked by a very large company to give a proposal on helping them break into the world of product development through "open" channels.  Up to this point they have not explored any avenues of open innovation, co-development, co-creation, etc.  All of their new product development is currently done internally at one of their design centers by engineers on staff.

We have not previously done this for any of our current clients.  I am trying to learn as much as possible about this by exploring the web but obviously it's impossible to become an expert on something in a few weeks by googling.  

Here are my questions.

1.  Are there any good sites/books/sources of information on the subject to help my own knowledge?

2.  I feel we are going to need some help to come up with a successful proposal.  I would like to hire a consultant.  I have looked for experienced individuals but most people with this type of experience are already working for a Open Innovation Intermediary.  Where can I find someone who knows this field but is not currently working for a company directly involved in the industry.  I realize this question may be semi-circular.

3.  I am concerned specifically about IP and how it is typically handled between the OEM, external investors, and the engineers/inventors performing the work.  Any information on this subject would be helpful.

Thanks much,
Kyle
