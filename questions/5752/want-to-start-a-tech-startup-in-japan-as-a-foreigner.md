I want to create a branch office in Japan. Does anyone have any previous experiences eith this? 

As you can see, To open a sub office I have to go through some kind of official regulations and have to search for a good location to create a nice base. Are there any preferable advantages that I can get from various sectors like governmental or non-governmental?

Imho the question in its current wording is not good for this Q&A site.

Anyways, when starting a (software) business in Japan as a foreigner, [Patrick McKenzie](http://www.kalzumeus.com/) aka patio11 is probably the single most authoritative person to give advice.

The cool thing is that he discusses the topic **Starting / Doing business in Japan** in his [podcast](http://www.kalzumeus.com/category/podcasts/) as well as on his blog and email newsletter.

First Patrick was a salary man in Japan. Then he started the app **Bingo Card Creator** which he sold recently. He currently runs **Appointment Reminder** and has founded **Starfighter** recently. Currently he's living in Tokyo.
