<p>I want to create a branch office in Japan. Does anyone have any previous experiences eith this? </p>

<p>As you can see, To open a sub office I have to go through some kind of official regulations and have to search for a good location to create a nice base. Are there any preferable advantages that I can get from various sectors like governmental or non-governmental?</p>

<p>Imho the question in its current wording is not good for this Q&amp;A site.</p>

<hr>

<p>Anyways, when starting a (software) business in Japan as a foreigner, <a href="http://www.kalzumeus.com/" rel="nofollow">Patrick McKenzie</a> aka patio11 is probably the single most authoritative person to give advice.</p>

<p>The cool thing is that he discusses the topic <strong>Starting / Doing business in Japan</strong> in his <a href="http://www.kalzumeus.com/category/podcasts/" rel="nofollow">podcast</a> as well as on his blog and email newsletter.</p>

<p>First Patrick was a salary man in Japan. Then he started the app <strong>Bingo Card Creator</strong> which he sold recently. He currently runs <strong>Appointment Reminder</strong> and has founded <strong>Starfighter</strong> recently. Currently he's living in Tokyo.</p>
