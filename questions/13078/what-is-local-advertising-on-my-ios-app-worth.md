<p>Sorry if this is in the wrong section. I couldn't find a section for advertising questions.</p>

<p>I have a local iOS app (it is for the local bus transit for a city in Canada) and I am thinking of switching from AdMob ads to just finding one local business that wants the slot. I am wondering what a fair way to price my advertising is to businesses. It would be a banner ad at the bottom of the app across all of the app. I think since it is a local app that I might be able to get more for advertising from a local business. Here are some app stats based on Itunes Connect and Firebase Analytics:</p>

<p><strong>Itunes Connect</strong><br>
7930 total downloads (units)</p>

<p><strong>Firebase Analytics</strong><br>
1200 active monthly users<br>
655 active weekly users<br>
276 active daily users<br>
12 hours 46 minutes daily engagement<br>
2 minutes 46 seconds engagement per user<br>
58.4/41.6 female/Male ratio<br>

<p>There are several pricing models you can offer:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pay per User: each user on a given day will cost a set amount of money e.g. 20-50 pcs</li>
<li>Pay per Click: You link the website and they pay you for each click they get e.g 1-2 dollar.</li>
<li>Fix pricing they pay per day a set amount of cash I would say with 270-280 daily users 100-300 dollars a day.</li>
</ul>

<p>this will get you a nice sum of money per month e.g. 150 dollars a day makes 4500 dollars a month, the more advertisment slots you have the lower your price can be, but keep in mind that ads are super annoying for your users. You don't want to lose them because of over advertising. If you have multiple ad slots you can also sell them for different prices. Better placement higher price principle. </p>

<p>In the end it is up to you how you want to model it and upto your customers how much they want to pay you. I hope it was of help and good luck with the app!</p>
