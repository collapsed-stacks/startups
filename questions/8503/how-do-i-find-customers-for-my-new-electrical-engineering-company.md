I have a new engineering company with only one employee for now (myself). 

How do I find customers ? <br />
What is the best way ? 

I specialize in embedded electronics, circuit board design, sensors, and embedded and firmware programming. I have 5 years work experience at a big wellknown company with a master's degree in electrical engineering. What should my strategy for finding clients be?

<p><strong>Walk, Talk, Think Like Your Customer. Become Your Customer.</strong> </p>

<p>Assuming your primary 'product' offering is service-based electrical engineering solutions -- as opposed to offering tangible products -- I suggest immersing yourself in a world of all things relevant to your target market with particular attention on their needs, pains, challenges etc. I recommend the following as first steps:     </p>

<ul>
<li>discover the exact language, terms &amp; topics used by your target market when searching for information or discussing challenges. Resource: <a href="https://adwords.google.com/o/Targeting/Explorer?__c=1000000000&amp;__u=1000000000&amp;ideaRequestType=KEYWORD_IDEAS" rel="nofollow">Google Keyword Adwords Tool</a> </li>
<li>participate &amp; discuss their questions on social networking sites, industry forums, blogs etc. </li>
</ul>

<p>With regular practice you'll be able to anticipate your markets needs, early, and deploy solutions that establish your company as an authority in your field. Strive to create what is deemed 'unfair advantage' and never stop innovating or thinking creatively. I wish you and your new venture well.</p>

<p>If you think that your products deserve some media coverage, I got some tips <a href="http://www.superbcrew.com/how-to-approach-pr-and-get-a-kick-ass-media-coverage/" rel="nofollow">here</a> how to get it easier for you. If that is not case, I think the best suited for you would be to take some course about google AdWords, you can also check materials directly <a href="https://support.google.com/partners/topic/3204437?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=3111012" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
