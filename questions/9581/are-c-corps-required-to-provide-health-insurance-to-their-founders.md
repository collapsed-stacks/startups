<p>Are C-corps required to provide health insurance to their founders, even if they are pre-revenue, unfunded and have no other employees? (This is in California, if it matters)</p>

<p>Employers of less than 50 full-time employees are not subject to tax penalties if they do not provide health insurance to their employees, so a small founders-only company doesn't have to provide health insurance.</p>
