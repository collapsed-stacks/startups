Here's below the consideration that I have:

1- **Acceptance**: My prospect agreed that I can conduct a pilot test project at his premises.

2- **Best Practice certificate**: They can't provide me with an experience certificate once the test is accepted but rather the results are used for my prospect upper management that will provide later the experience certificate.

3- **Exclusivity:** My prospect won't give me the certificate until they can secure a form of partnership with me so they can share revenues with me.

4- **Value-Based pricing**: A typical product pricing of my software would be a value-based price which can range from 5 to 10 percent of the extra production revenue gained by the customer.

5- **MVP for a short period**: The prospect asked for a Minimum Viable Product on a 3-month period i.e. They accept to pay but based on a 3-month work from engineering to installation before they go to upper management.

Based on the above, what would be a fair pricing and how it can be justified while present it to my prospect.

Appreciate any help.
