<p>We are a small startup getting bogged down by paperwork as part of handling customer orders (requesting extra info, pulling customer info from online site A to template B, sending confirmation mails etc).</p>

<p>We are looking to further trim our processes and are considering creating a small script/program that eg takes an order ID and a few inputs and then cuts through multiple steps (eg create invoice, send mail, print xyz, ...).</p>

<p>Do you have good sites for outsourcing small projects like this to programmers at fixed rate agreed costs?</p>

<p>Also, if some of you have good suggestions for free/cheap software/tools that might help trim time in order handling, it would be highly valuable!</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>There are a number of such sites where you can do exactly what you want.  Try <a href="http://www.fiverr.com" rel="nofollow">Fiverr.com</a>, <a href="http://www.guru.com" rel="nofollow">Guru.com</a>, or <a href="http://www.upwork.com" rel="nofollow">UpWork.com</a>.</p>

<p>You need to be sure to clearly spell out what it is you want, how long you're willing to give them, and a budget to work with.  These sites let you post jobs of any size and let people bid for the work.</p>

<p>I hope this helps.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
