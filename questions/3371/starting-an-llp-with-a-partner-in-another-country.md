My friends and I have decided to start a business doing something we've always wanted to do. Between us, we have plenty of business knowledge and the technical knowledge to achieve what we're setting out to do but we have come up against a potential challenge when registering the company - which we could be over thinking.

The partnership will be created between 3 people, all working remotely, which involves the following locations, England - where I'm based, Wales and Ireland itself (specifically not Northern).

How does registering a partnership with one or more of the partners effectively being in different countries? A majority of which are based in the UK

When you register a business it does not matter where you are from. You do not have to be a resident in the country you are registering your business in. I think this applies to most countries, but there might be countries where the law state otherwise. I do not think registration will be the issue. 

I think an issue you might run into is the actual employment of this person and paying them salaries. I used to run a company from The Netherlands with a majority of our technical development in the USA. Eventually we decided to take on each developer only as an individual contractor. If your business is small and he is working only on a dividend basis, I don't think you will have many issues.

Edit 2: make sure to describe in the contract who is liable for which taxes and describe which legislation your agreement is in.
