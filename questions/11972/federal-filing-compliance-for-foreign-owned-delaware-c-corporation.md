I recently incorporated my startup company in Delaware as C Corporation. I will be doing online business and operate out of Canada. I am told to file for the Delaware annual return and paying the annual Delaware franchise tax by March.

However, I don't know anything about the US federal corporate filing requirement and have found conflicting information about this using google!

So is my corporation required to file the US federal corporate tax return (eg. form 1120)? As for now, the company is inactive (ie. no business transactions) and has close to zero assets.

Thank you for your advice!
