I have a B2B startup idea which needs to collaborate with multiple other companies in order to work.

On the Business model level it will be just an online platform operated from Indian servers.
But the scope can be published internationally. Now what I want to know is if I made overseas connections with companies but operated from India, then can I do that legally?

or do I have to jump the legal circus first?

Without more details this is fairly basic and non-specific but it should give you a start.

Assuming that you are not dealing with the shipping itself, and that you are careful you should be able to avoid any legal hassles. I would suggest avoiding medications, finance and armaments unless you get competent legal advice.

Important considerations:

Sanctions/Embargo's: While India has historically been quite lax on following UN sanctions India itself may have a sanctions list of countries/entities that you can't deal with without license. I couldn't find one but you might want to ask a government advisor in the state you are basing in. 

Foreign Taxes: As long as you have no physical presence elsewhere than India that will generally not be a concern.

Shipping: If you don't do the shipping yourself you avoid having to deal with import/export forms and requirements. If you do the shipping yourself you will have to do different forms for every location to/from and it will get much more complicated.

I don't see a problem in that. You just need the right set of skills, knowledge, investment & entrepreneurship in you. Operating internationally requires some additional paper works that you can either complete yourself or you can opt for a lawyer to do all the hard work for you.
