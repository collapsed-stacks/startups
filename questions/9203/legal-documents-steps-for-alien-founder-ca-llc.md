Bootstrapped startup: CA LLC single member(C-form as it is a must for aliens) brings in a co-founder/developer. Both are non-US and living in EU. 

1. Is it possible to add a co-founder to a single-member LLC? What legal documents are needed and where can I find such free templates? 

2. Does it make more sense to change the LLC into Inc. as we are planning to raise in the next months? What documents do I need? Should I approach a lawyer for it or looking for templates?

3. What IP documents do I need if he wants to migrate the actual coding to his already developed marketplace (and using Microsoft Azure)? How can I evaluate the value of his coding/work if I´m not a tech founder?
