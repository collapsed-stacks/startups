<p>The choice of name is something very personal. What can be done is as follows. Define the values, mission, and vision of your business. Write this!</p>

<p>Exactly so, take the paper and scribble it!</p>

<p>Write also the technologies!</p>

<p>Based on this write several names that provide the idea that your company wants to pass. Imagine yourself as a user searching on Google and just read the name of your company. Is the name conveying the feeling you would like it to convey?</p>

<p>It's almost a spiritual process :)</p>

<p>There is lot of fuss around the naming a company. And why isnit so important. Here is an example:
When i say I have worked ar <code>stackoverflow</code> It should right. But when i say i have worked at <code>akeooxaaaha</code> I myself cant pronounce it. </p>

<p>Similarly, You need to think of name, a tech-name that is going to define your purpose of your company. And also rhe name should be easy to remember because If i want to share a word with another, I need to remember it.</p>

<p>As Lucas mentioned, scrible it. Find Anagrams of the purpose you will like to resolve. Its a very hard and important step. You cant go wrong here!</p>

<p>I am not an expert in this field, but I am in a similar situation and I have to learn about this, but do not have the time. </p>

<p>to break it down, in the internet field it is important to take in consideration SEO strategy when searching for a name, so think what your customer would type in their google search when they search for the service you provide. If you are a social network or some kind of website that bring people together like for renting Airbnb brings tenants and landlords together.. those two categories will make different type of searches online.
Landlord may search "earning by sharing or renting the apartment", "couchsurfing" etc... tenants may just search "cheap accommodation in london"</p>

<p>I got to know Airbnb by some words of mounth online, so maybe magazines, newspaper online making reviews of websites, other people, friends.. because it was already popular..</p>

<p>There will be people that search you so you need to find a way to get found easily and people you introduce your company to.. so the name should make sense, it can be normal people, but it may also be investors/professionals which are specialized in that field so you should take in consideration the basics</p>
