Pretty straight forward question.  Assuming the servers and computers are used 100% for my business, can they be deducted on my taxes?  If so, how much?  Say I purchased a server+upgrades for $4000, can I deduct that entire $4000?

In most countries that I know of computers, monitors, printers and such are considered as capital expense by accounting rules, so you will have to follow capital cost allowance rules in your jurisdiction. For example, in Canada you would be able to write off 1/3 of the original cost each year for three years.

Minor components, such as mice, keyboards, replacement parts probably can be written off as current expenses. However, this again depends on jurisdiction. 

You should talk to a professional accountant familiar with laws in your location.
