If a co-founder leaves a company before their shares have vested, what happens to those shares? Are they distributed among the remaining owners or are they held for a new investor? Is there a standard process for this?

As a disclaimer, I know nothing about vesting stocks.

However, while I was researching what vested stock is, I came across [this](http://blog.venturedocs.com/2013/02/vesting-of-shares/). It states "If a stockholder ceases to provide services to the corporation and owns unvested shares, then the corporation will have an option to repurchase the unvested shares at their original issue price, which is often times the par value of the stock, a very low number".
