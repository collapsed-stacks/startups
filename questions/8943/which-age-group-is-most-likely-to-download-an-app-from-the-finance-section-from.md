I am trying to determine how many users are likely to download my app (market size) and to determine this figure, I am trying to figure out which age group is most active in the Finance section of their app stores. 

I have determined that people aged between 18-34 are most concerned about their finances, but require more concrete evidence on what ages are most actively downloading Financial apps, seeing as that's how I would categorize my app.

I have searched around, but cannot determine a figure.

Your question is similar to something I have previously advised on https://startups.stackexchange.com/a/8876/7909

But... Food for thought...

There are thousands of apps - only a hundred enter the top 100 (hence why its called "top 100" so you launch your app, 20,000 financial apps on offer, how many times will the user have to page down until they find your app and then decide to try it?

What end user research have you done?

How will an end user find out about your app?

What makes your app any better than the others out there?

I'm not trying to put you off but I am trying to set expectations. I've no doubt you have worked hard on it, but based on my limited experience, despite best efforts results failed to meet my lowest expectations.

IMHO forget measuring on who might or might not and instead, devote your time to ensuring someone does.

Best of luck!
