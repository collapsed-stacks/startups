<p>I am looking for a service that will allow me to use php to execute imagemagick commands, as well as store images that I need to use with imagemagick. It doesn't need to be web hosting or website related, I just need the space for the images, and imagemagick. Does anyone know where I could find this? Hopefully for free?</p>

<p>HostGator has some pretty cheap webhosting packages with 'unlimited' storage and pretty good accessibility. You would need to check, but I am almost certain they have imagemagick installed.</p>
