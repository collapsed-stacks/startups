There are a lot of freelance sites out there but I'm having difficulty finding the right kind of people e.g. - professional tone, good grasp of English and tactful to do a range of per job / per hour marketing tasks. Any tips for finding people?

These aren't actually boring tasks, they just require time to do.

Kinds of tasks I am looking at:

 - Researching websites, blogs, organisations that are relevant to a
   product and emailing them to ask if they are interesting in
   back-linking / participating. 
 - Posting an item on a social media sites- one per day for different products
 - Following a media correspondence plan to ask for coverage / review / promotion of a
   product. 
 - Researching funding resourcing

I'm keen to either go the UK based assistant route, Eastern Europe or look further East e.g. India / Philipines / Malaysia.

<p>Depending on your budget, you have a couple of outsourcing options, and all your tasks can be catered for with these companies listed below. If you don't like any of these, then Google 'Virtual Assistant' or 'Virtual Assistant India' for other options - there are loads out there!</p>

<p><a href="http://web.timeetc.co.uk/powerful/" rel="nofollow">Time Etc</a> is a UK based, UK sourced company so the prices are a little on the expensive side at £26 an hour. Unlike the other companies on this list, I think they only charge hourly which means they could take two hours to complete a one hour task and you'll be £52 out of pocket instead of £26.</p>

<p>If you're looking for something a little cheaper, then I'd recommend outsourcing your work to somewhere like India. I haven't used all of these myself so can't recommend one over the other, but there are benefits and drawbacks to each so they're worth having a look at and see which one suits you and your business most.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.taskseveryday.com/" rel="nofollow">Tasks Everyday</a> - starts at around £5 an hour (or $7 USD) and allows you to increase or decrease your team size with minimal notice. They also cater for different industries such as bookkeeping, accounts, web design or just normal virtual assistants. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.yourdailytasks.com/" rel="nofollow">Your Daily Tasks</a> - I've used this company before (but sadly, am not getting any commission for this mention!), it allows you to pay either on an hourly basis or a project basis. It's harder to get a quote for the latter because, you guessed it, it depends on the task size... but it shouldn't take very long to get a quote for the type of tasks you're after.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.brickworkindia.com/" rel="nofollow">Brickwork India</a>  - this company was recommended in Tim Ferriss' 4 Hour Work Week but I haven't used them myself (they were in huge demand after the book was released and I felt like they were struggling with the workload, that's just my opinion though). They operate in a similar way to YDT and you can set up either an hourly or task-based plan with them.</p>

<p>So yeah, it's worth shopping around and getting a best price for the work you've got lined up. I'd always suggest going for a task-based rather than an hourly rate (and that applies to life in general... like if you're getting your windows replaced or getting your bathroom redone)</p>

<p>Anwyay, apologies for the essay, but I hope this helps!</p>

An approach which we successfully tried this summer is to use an intern or someone who is currently studying. 

The advantages to you are that they can be very bright; with an excellent grasp of English, particularly if you go for someone interested in writing; are willing to work part-time while they study / do bursts over the holidays; they are cheap, especially given their ability. Also, it may be the only way you are able to afford someone with expertise in the area you are after, e.g. chemical engineering.

They are keen to get some CV points, learn about the business environment, get a lead to a job, gain experience and apply the skills they are learning.
