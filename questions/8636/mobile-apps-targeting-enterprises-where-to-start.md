I have a good amount of experience in mobile development, not so much in business, and I wanted to learn about the general business model for building enterprise apps.

For example (hypothetically), say there's an online retailer that sells car parts. And I build an educational app teaching users how to fix cars. How would I go about partnering with that company so I can tailor the app to them, and say include links to their site, and recommend products from their site and such.

Would I need a license for the app? Would I need to form a LLC?

To sum up the question, I'm interesting in learning how indie developers are targeting enterprises.
