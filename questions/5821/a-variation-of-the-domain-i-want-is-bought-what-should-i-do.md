## A variation of the domain I want is bought. What should I do?

I've been building a site on my localhost around a brandable domain name I've had my eyes on (for example, `buymycar.com`)

It's still available for registration, but I haven't purchased it yet because there's a variation that I was waiting for to become available so I can buy both at the same time so I can catch traffic from both URLs. Let's assume the variation is `buymycarS.com`.

As you can see, they're very similar. Someone have bought it as soon as it became available. I seriously thought no one would buy it. So now, I'm in a rut:

 - The domain I actually want is still available
 - The similar domain variation was registered before I could snag it

What should I do? Should I just buy the original domain and forget about the variation? Or should I just brand under another name entirely? 

I know that if my site takes off, the variation owner will probably sell it back later for a steep price. What if they launch a competitor site under that variation?

What would you do?

Unregistered domains doesn't cost a lot to buy one. You can sell if you don't need to use it. Registered domains belong to someone else and they can price it whatever they want.

What are you waiting for?

Awesome! Buy it **NOW**! Even if you don't use it, it's not a big loss.

Making you pay a lot for a domain is hard to prevent. Someone launching a competitor is much easier to prevent. Look into getting a trademark for the name. You can then use the courts to shut down any confusingly similar businesses.
