<p>I've been building a site on my localhost around a brandable domain name I've had my eyes on (for example, <code>buymycar.com</code>)</p>

<p>It's still available for registration, but I haven't purchased it yet because there's a variation that I was waiting for to become available so I can buy both at the same time so I can catch traffic from both URLs. Let's assume the variation is <code>buymycarS.com</code>.</p>

<p>As you can see, they're very similar. Someone have bought it as soon as it became available. I seriously thought no one would buy it. So now, I'm in a rut:</p>

<ul>
<li>The domain I actually want is still available</li>
<li>The similar domain variation was registered before I could snag it</li>
</ul>

<p>What should I do? Should I just buy the original domain and forget about the variation? Or should I just brand under another name entirely? </p>

<p>I know that if my site takes off, the variation owner will probably sell it back later for a steep price. What if they launch a competitor site under that variation?</p>

<p>What would you do?</p>

<p>Unregistered domains doesn't cost a lot to buy one. You can sell if you don't need to use it. Registered domains belong to someone else and they can price it whatever they want.</p>

<p>What are you waiting for?</p>

<p>Awesome! Buy it <strong>NOW</strong>! Even if you don't use it, it's not a big loss.</p>

<p>Making you pay a lot for a domain is hard to prevent. Someone launching a competitor is much easier to prevent. Look into getting a trademark for the name. You can then use the courts to shut down any confusingly similar businesses.</p>
