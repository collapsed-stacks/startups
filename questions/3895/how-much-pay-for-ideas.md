<p>I am an app developer, submitting apps to App Store. Usually I get feedbacks from friends, and I am appreciative for it. It can be a small thing style / colors,  but sometimes they came with whole ideas, visions, and sooner or latter I realised that it effects me, and my app works as he described his / her vision.</p>

<p>What do you do in this situation. Give share I you get rich? How much percent? He / she has no programming knowledge / App Store etc. only ideas.</p>

<p>Buy them a dinner, or two tickets to a sport event or the opera or whatever they like.</p>

<p>Seriously.</p>

<p>If you end up in a situation where they're <em>expecting</em> payment, they'll no longer be delivering feedback <em>as friends</em>.</p>

<p>If they actually <em>execute</em> the idea, of course, it's different. Then they're definitely entitled to some kind of payment -- hopefully agreed upon in advance. But just for the idea: nada.</p>

<p>Assuming they've had negligible assistance with the actual execution, you don't want to put yourself in a position where they have some control over the business - whether it be legally through voting shares, or through socially through expectations.</p>

<p>However I think there's a case for being more generous than just buying them a couple tickets to a sports game. Note that I'm talking about generosity in return for core business ideas here, not small stuff like UI tweaks.</p>

<p><strong>For yourself</strong></p>

<p>How you conduct yourself affects your reputation, which in turn affects opportunities. If you get a reputation of generously rewarding people who've shared valuable ideas with you, I expect that others would be more inclined to share their ideas with you.</p>

<p>What's considered "generous" is going to be proportional to your success - make a couple hundred k, sports game tickets could be reasonable. Make a couple hundred mil, sports game tickets are looking pretty tight-fisted.</p>

<p><strong>For others</strong></p>

<p>If you've taken the idea and generated serious profit from it, you should have space to be benevolent with that profit towards others. If someone's given you valuable ideas, I think they'd be a fair candidate to receive something.</p>

<p>I quite like this motivation, as firstly it means your hard work benefits others in a increased number of ways, and secondly it drives you to build more profitable businesses.</p>

<p>The way any of this comes about is critical though - the generosity shouldn't be under compulsion. Given the nature of startups, any expectation from them for personal reward is likely to cause issues.</p>
