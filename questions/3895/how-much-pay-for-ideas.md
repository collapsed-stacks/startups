I am an app developer, submitting apps to App Store. Usually I get feedbacks from friends, and I am appreciative for it. It can be a small thing style / colors,  but sometimes they came with whole ideas, visions, and sooner or latter I realised that it effects me, and my app works as he described his / her vision.

What do you do in this situation. Give share I you get rich? How much percent? He / she has no programming knowledge / App Store etc. only ideas.

Buy them a dinner, or two tickets to a sport event or the opera or whatever they like.

Seriously.

If you end up in a situation where they're *expecting* payment, they'll no longer be delivering feedback *as friends*.

If they actually *execute* the idea, of course, it's different. Then they're definitely entitled to some kind of payment -- hopefully agreed upon in advance. But just for the idea: nada.

Assuming they've had negligible assistance with the actual execution, you don't want to put yourself in a position where they have some control over the business - whether it be legally through voting shares, or through socially through expectations.

However I think there's a case for being more generous than just buying them a couple tickets to a sports game. Note that I'm talking about generosity in return for core business ideas here, not small stuff like UI tweaks.

**For yourself**

How you conduct yourself affects your reputation, which in turn affects opportunities. If you get a reputation of generously rewarding people who've shared valuable ideas with you, I expect that others would be more inclined to share their ideas with you.

What's considered "generous" is going to be proportional to your success - make a couple hundred k, sports game tickets could be reasonable. Make a couple hundred mil, sports game tickets are looking pretty tight-fisted.

**For others**

If you've taken the idea and generated serious profit from it, you should have space to be benevolent with that profit towards others. If someone's given you valuable ideas, I think they'd be a fair candidate to receive something.

I quite like this motivation, as firstly it means your hard work benefits others in a increased number of ways, and secondly it drives you to build more profitable businesses.

The way any of this comes about is critical though - the generosity shouldn't be under compulsion. Given the nature of startups, any expectation from them for personal reward is likely to cause issues.
