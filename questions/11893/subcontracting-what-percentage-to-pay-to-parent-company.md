What would be a typical percentage that a subcontracting company pay to the parent company? I am a new cloud consulting business. I would like to bid on a state contract; however, my business is very new and  does not meet the minimum requirements to bid. I found an established company that meets the minimum requirements. We discussed  and the company agreed that they could subcontract me, i.e. bid on the project  themselves and, if awarded, give the execution of the project to my company.

What percentage am I expected to pay back to the established company? Is percentage calculated from revenue or profit? Anything I should watch out for?

Thank you!
