<p>We are interested in getting a ICP license for our China version of our site (e.g. example.cn instead of example.com)</p>

<p>But we are no way to setup a China company, nor we are interested to put the server in China, so can we still able get the ICP license?</p>

<p>We want to get the ICP license so we have fewer chance that our site will be blocked by the GFW of china.</p>

<p>In the past, you could get a 3rd party to complete the paper work for you, but this is no longer the case, since you must be a China-registered business to apply for an ICP license.</p>

<p>You can use a Chinese citizen's ID to apply the ICP for you. Someone you trusted.</p>

<p>If you want to put the server in China you have to get an ICP. It's essential.</p>

<p>There is another option for you, put your server in Hongkong, it belongs to China but has another policy. You don't need to apply for an ICP. </p>
