We are interested in getting a ICP license for our China version of our site (e.g. example.cn instead of example.com)

But we are no way to setup a China company, nor we are interested to put the server in China, so can we still able get the ICP license?

We want to get the ICP license so we have fewer chance that our site will be blocked by the GFW of china.

<p>In the past, you could get a 3rd party to complete the paper work for you, but this is no longer the case, since you must be a China-registered business to apply for an ICP license.</p>

You can use a Chinese citizen's ID to apply the ICP for you. Someone you trusted.

If you want to put the server in China you have to get an ICP. It's essential.

There is another option for you, put your server in Hongkong, it belongs to China but has another policy. You don't need to apply for an ICP.
