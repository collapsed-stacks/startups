I want to implement online payments on my SAT website, but most companies that provide such services require me to have a company or business name.

I am 18yo and and the process of getting a company registered seems too daunting for me. <br />There is no one around me that could me help me either. Are there any online payment services that don't require a registered business?

Any other advice in general would be appreciated.

<p>Not all payment services require you to have your own merchant facilities - for instance <a href="http://www.paypal.com" rel="nofollow">Paypal</a> and <a href="http://stripe.com/" rel="nofollow">Stripe</a> have services that are suitable for private individuals as well as business services. What's available locally to you may vary, but I would start by researching Paypal as they have extensive help resources and a strong range of integration methods.</p>

<p>So what if you discover there are no options that you can take up without a trading name and business bank account?</p>

<p>Again, depending on your jurisdiction, you may find that you can get a business bank account as a sole trader, which can cut down the admin especially if you already have a bank account. Other legal forms may also exist that entail less paperwork.</p>

<p>If no other option is available to you, you could either find someone who has multiple companies and is willing to be your sleeping partner, taking the lead on admin, or find another developer local to you who has a registered business and is willing to make an agreement so that payments are made through them.</p>

<p>However, sooner or later you are going to want to make the leap. You're right to be cautious: when you're starting out, you want to discover whether you can create a valuable business before you add admin and expenses. Everyone had their own first time, and there are plenty of resources to help you when you do decide the time is right.</p>

<p>I can't comment on the Stripe answer above but for web-only transactions I'd highly recommend it for another reason: liability.  It has a unique hashing/key method for card storage where the card number never actually stays with you and instead resides with them.  This pretty much absolves/protects you from data theft liability should your server or system get breached. Since you're working as an individual without limited liability protection that's important. <a href="https://stripe.com/us/features#seamless-security" rel="nofollow">Stripe security</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.paypal.com/" rel="nofollow">Paypal</a> is one of the most universally recognized options and many people will feel comfortable using Paypal's service to pay you.</p>

<p>Depending on how serious you are about your business you may want to consider a business license. In most states, they are fairly affordable if you consider the potential benefits they provide. You'll want to consider what sort of structure suits you best - sole proprietor? Limited Liability Company? I'd suggest looking into a limited liability company in your state, they are often reasonably inexpensive, easy to draw up documents for (search for LLC template), and provide you the benefits of a business account, potential payment services etc.</p>

<p>I actually picked an LLC for the tutoring company I currently operate, if the same structure makes sense for your situation I'm not sure, but I can say it's easier than you think once you dive in and search for a few guides on registering your business in your state. Often there are dedicated state employees to help you do something just like it.</p>

<p>Good luck! </p>
