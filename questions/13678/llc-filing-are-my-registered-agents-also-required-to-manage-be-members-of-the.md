## LLC Filing: are my registered agents also required to manage (be members of) the LLC?

I'm filing for an LLC in Florida (parents live there) for monetary savings (e.g., $200 to file in NYC, $125 to file in Florida), but I'm based out of NYC. I just submitted the `Articles of Organization` (located [here][1], then go to **Florida LLC Forms**), but think I made a mistake.

Basically, to file in Florida, I needed to add them as a `Registered Agent` and their address. Lower on the form it asks for `Name And Address of Person(s) Authorized to Manage LLC`. Given that they're listed as a `Registered Agent`, I assumed they would also be `Authorized Persons`. I've listed all three of us as `AMBR` (`Authorized Member: authorized to execute and file records with this office`).

Now as I'm filling out the `Operating Agreement`, the Florida Filing website suggests a `Multi-member Organization`, and asking for % interest per member.

**Question**: I'm wondering if putting their names (parents) as `Authorized Persons` was unnecessary (not needed for them being `Registered Agents`) and adds liability to them as well as me. I should be the only member with any sort of liability, and they should only be agents based in Florida. Is that the case?

Side note: I think it's okay if I file outside the state I live in, as [this article][2] states:

> However, it's important to consider the fees and state income taxes
> your business may be required to pay if you file in your home state.
> For that reason, if your business has no physical facility or
> storefront—a consulting business, for example—or if you plan on
> conducting the majority of your business out of state, you should
> consider starting an LLC in a state other than your home state.

I know this isn't your question, but are you sure that there are tax benefits to creating an LLC in FL?  If you live and work in NYC, I suspect there are not any tax benefits.

For your question, the registered agent should not be a member.  I suspect you want a single-member LLC where you will be the only member.  All members share in profits and losses.
