I would like to get basic information about a business located in the state of Georgia, for verification purpose.

Is there government website or credible third party website for such lookup which is publicly available?

The first stop is typically the Secretary of State website. For any particular state, you can typically search "[NAME OF STATE] Secretary of State Business Search". A state may use slightly different terminology, but Google is smart enough to autosuggest you the right one. 

Here is the link for the Georgia website: 
https://ecorp.sos.ga.gov/BusinessSearch

To see if there are complaints, you can check out the Better Business Bureau website at http://www.bbb.org/.
