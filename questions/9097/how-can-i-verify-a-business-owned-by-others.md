<p>I would like to get basic information about a business located in the state of Georgia, for verification purpose.</p>

<p>Is there government website or credible third party website for such lookup which is publicly available?</p>

<p>The first stop is typically the Secretary of State website. For any particular state, you can typically search "[NAME OF STATE] Secretary of State Business Search". A state may use slightly different terminology, but Google is smart enough to autosuggest you the right one. </p>

<p>Here is the link for the Georgia website: 
<a href="https://ecorp.sos.ga.gov/BusinessSearch" rel="nofollow">https://ecorp.sos.ga.gov/BusinessSearch</a></p>

<p>To see if there are complaints, you can check out the Better Business Bureau website at <a href="http://www.bbb.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbb.org/</a>. </p>
