<p>What are the implications of adding a suffix to a technological startup ? </p>

<p>For example an IT company called <b>x</b> can have the suffixes <b> IT, Labs, Technologies </b>.<br /> 
Which one of these signals an innovative and flexible company ?</p>

<p>I have heard cases of a company name ending in Labs being rejected as the Registrar of Companies thought they were going to be making chemical weapons.</p>
