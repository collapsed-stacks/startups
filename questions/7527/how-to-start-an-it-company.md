<p>I am MCA student from India. I'm interested in technology, I have been looking for a job for a long time as an Android developer but I didn't get any. They all needed minimum of one year experience which I don't have.</p>

<p>Is it possible to start my own IT company? I have no idea how to start and how can I get any project and programmers to complete that project.</p>

<p>First, not all companies look for one year experience. If you're already familiar with Android and have developed a few apps which are already on the store, I'm sure that there are many companies out there which will hire you.</p>

<p>Secondly, if you want to really start your IT company then you shouldn't do it just because you didn't get a job. You can't start a company of the likes of Infosys in one night. So, you should start with developing apps and publishing your apps on the store. In the meantime, start building and selling yourself as the brand. Write blogs, tweet, promote yourself. You should start getting projects soon. Complete your projects in time and get more of them. Now register your company and start hiring people to get the job done. Slowly and steadily, in 4-5 years, you might have a small IT company.</p>

<p>Remember, it is always easier said than done.</p>

<p>Good Luck</p>

<p>This is such a broad question that even a tl:dr wont do any justice for the readers.</p>

<p>But just a small pseudo code to start with</p>

<pre><code>1. Observe everything around you. If tired then go to Step 5 else stick on Step 1
2. Do you find any problem? If yes then go on Step 3 else go on Step 1 again.
3. Found a problem! think of possible solutions. Think if your solution will do justice to the problem. If yes go to Step 4 else go to stick to Step 2 or go on Step 1 if you want to tackle something else.
4. Go and implement it yourselves or if you have money shell it out to other coders to implement.
5. Submit your resumes on angel.co, Linkedin etc etc and do a job.
</code></pre>

<p>It is not easy to start company , It require following :</p>

<p>1 - Projects</p>

<p>2 - Money and Time investment</p>

<p>3 - Management Skill</p>

<p>4 - Patience </p>

<p>5 - Industrial Experience [Optional but helpful]</p>

<p>6 - Marketing strategies and implementation</p>

<p>In India If you analyze there are lot of new companies starts daily and failed to run business and finally get close. And there are also some companies which get good business and work with profit. So its all depends on above factors which I have listed.</p>

<p>I suggest you to try to find job again and get some good industrial experience so you can know that what is going in market actually.</p>

<p>If finally you have decided not to do job then you can start freelancing at initial level. You can try to get project of your skills and then can do progress in a way which help you to start your own company after some time.</p>

<p>Opening an IT company is one of the hardest thing to do with no industry experience. First try to get industry experience and then give rethink to your idea of opening a business. But if you still want to do it then freelancing will get you glimpse of IT projects which eventually you want to build your business on. </p>
