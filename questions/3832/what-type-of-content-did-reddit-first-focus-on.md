<p>Reddit founders say that they solved the chicken/egg problem by creating lots of fake users &amp; contents.</p>

<p>Did they have a specific topic at the beginning? If so what was this topic?</p>

<p>If the content is gag, education etc., did they create the content them selves or copy it from various sites? (or both?)</p>

<p>I am wondering what their strategy was on choosing the topic/content etc.. </p>

<p>They focused on tech/geeky topics if the internet achive is anything to go by. There's also some politics and other debate-prone threads every here and there.</p>

</ul>

<p>Take note of thread #14 in that last url: "It's Okay to Self-Submit to Reddit!" If memory serves me well, the debate that led to it was instrumental in the site's mass-adoption and in ousting Digg.</p>
