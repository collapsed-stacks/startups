## What type of content did reddit first focus on?

Reddit founders say that they solved the chicken/egg problem by creating lots of fake users & contents.

Did they have a specific topic at the beginning? If so what was this topic?

If the content is gag, education etc., did they create the content them selves or copy it from various sites? (or both?)

I am wondering what their strategy was on choosing the topic/content etc..

They focused on tech/geeky topics if the internet achive is anything to go by. There's also some politics and other debate-prone threads every here and there.

Take note of thread #14 in that last url: "It's Okay to Self-Submit to Reddit!" If memory serves me well, the debate that led to it was instrumental in the site's mass-adoption and in ousting Digg.
