The USPTO defines [rules](http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/com/sol/og/con/files/cons157.htm) for the application for a US trademark. Two different application types are available:

 * _application based upon use in commerce_; an application
>  [...] must include allegations concerning dates of use and specimens evidencing use as a filing requirement.

 * _intent-to-use application_; required is
>  [...], a claim of a bona fide intention to use the mark in commerce, [...]

  Further:  

  > The applicant must submit a statement of use within six months of
  > that date, or request a six-month extension of time. 

Our start-up business is building a web service, and we're currently in beta operation. Customers aren't charged yet.

Is this status of operation enough for an _application based upon the use in commerce_ or do we have to reside to an _intent-to-use application_? If the latter, what do we have to provide for the _statement of use_?

The text on ["Specimen" Refusal and How to Overcome This Refusal](http://www.uspto.gov/trademark/laws-regulations/specimen-refusal-and-how-overcome-refusal) specifies what counts as a specimen and what doesn't. Specifically, the USPTO typically accepts

> A webpage showing or describing the product near the mark and with purchasing information (e.g., a webpage showing a photograph of a computer laptop, the mark for the laptop appearing above the photograph, the price appearing below the photograph, and a shopping cart button/link appearing on the page)

On the other hand, the specimen is refused if

> The specimen is a webpage that fails to include ordering information, pricing, and/or an association between the applied-for mark and an applicant's goods

Hence, the _commerce_ aspect of a product defines its use status.
