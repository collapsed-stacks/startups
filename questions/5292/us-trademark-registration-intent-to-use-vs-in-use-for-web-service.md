<p>The USPTO defines <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/com/sol/og/con/files/cons157.htm" rel="nofollow">rules</a> for the application for a US trademark. Two different application types are available:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>application based upon use in commerce</em>; an application</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[...] must include allegations concerning dates of use and specimens evidencing use as a filing requirement.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><em>intent-to-use application</em>; required is</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[...], a claim of a bona fide intention to use the mark in commerce, [...]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Further:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The applicant must submit a statement of use within six months of
  that date, or request a six-month extension of time. </p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>

<p>Our start-up business is building a web service, and we're currently in beta operation. Customers aren't charged yet.</p>

<p>Is this status of operation enough for an <em>application based upon the use in commerce</em> or do we have to reside to an <em>intent-to-use application</em>? If the latter, what do we have to provide for the <em>statement of use</em>?</p>

<p>The text on <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/trademark/laws-regulations/specimen-refusal-and-how-overcome-refusal" rel="nofollow">"Specimen" Refusal and How to Overcome This Refusal</a> specifies what counts as a specimen and what doesn't. Specifically, the USPTO typically accepts</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A webpage showing or describing the product near the mark and with purchasing information (e.g., a webpage showing a photograph of a computer laptop, the mark for the laptop appearing above the photograph, the price appearing below the photograph, and a shopping cart button/link appearing on the page)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the other hand, the specimen is refused if</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The specimen is a webpage that fails to include ordering information, pricing, and/or an association between the applied-for mark and an applicant's goods</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hence, the <em>commerce</em> aspect of a product defines its use status.</p>
