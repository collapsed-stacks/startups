Are there any sites where a startup can post outline ideas and attract interest from 3rd party development houses? e.g. Similar to oDesk etc. but not for individuals.

e.g.
iOS development, these components, that backend design, 3 month initial, etc.
(obviously more details than that!)

I don't want individual developers at this stage, nor permanent staff, I need a managed team which can cover my requirements. (UK based preferably at this stage).

I am looking to find small houses that I can then contact and review.

<p>A couple good places to start at are <a href="http://www.upwork.com" rel="nofollow">www.UpWork.com</a> and <a href="http://www.guru.com" rel="nofollow">www.guru.com</a>.
Both sites let you define projects you have underway or upcoming and then have individuals and teams bid to do the work.  You pay the sites themselves, and your money is only released to the developers once you're satisfied they've met the requirements, so it eliminates the risk to you.  Knowing their money is held by the site reassures the developers of payment for their work, so it's a win-win for everyone.  You can hire people for very small, short-term stuff or for larger projects that could span months.</p>

<p>I hope this helps.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
