<p>I've been asked to join a single-person startup as co-founder (position: VP of Sales). He has already coded the app and incorporated a company, of which he is CEO and sole board member. I've been working for the past month but now requested putting something down in writing. He had his lawyer draw up a contract and a couple of things are making me nervous. I'm new to the startup world so maybe these are standard. Please advice!</p>

<ol>
<li>No Founder shall receive any salary or other compensation for services rendered to the Company as a Founder or otherwise, except as otherwise agreed upon in writing by the Founders.  </li>
</ol>

<p>Right now the company is bootstrapped but hopefully we will start generating some revenue in the coming months. We are also planning on raising VC money in a year.  This implies I never get paid!</p>

<p>How do I play this? Do I suggest adding a clause that says upon third party investment, I shall receive a silicon valley comparable salary?</p>

<ol start="2">
<li>All provisions of this agreement are fully severable.</li>
</ol>

<p>This means he can change his mind anytime, say after I have worked for 11 months and sever the contract (I have a year cliff in my vesting schedule). I thus get nothing for 11 months of work.</p>

<p>Is this normal? I thought I'd suggest modifying it to read: This Agreement may only be changed, modified or terminated by an agreement in writing signed by both Founders.</p>

<p>What do you guys think?</p>

<ol start="3">
<li>Along the same lines, a friend suggesting protecting myself from 'termination' by immediate vesting of x% if I am terminated from position of founder without cause. How do I phrase that though and what is a reasonable percentage?</li>
</ol>

<p>Thanks all</p>
