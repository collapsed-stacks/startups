<p>Try anonymous open questions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What would be the top things you'd suggest we do to improve your day to day work environment and make your work day more pleasant?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you end up with a scathing list of wants and management-related problems, your employees are probably irritated.</p>

<p>If it's little details like "I need a bigger screen" or "I need a second screen," you're probably OK.</p>

<p>Oh, and do act on those. Report back to the employees after surveying them. Thank them for their replies. And act on them <em>visibly</em>. And if they do ask for bigger screens or another screen, then by all means give them one (or explain why you cannot just right now in terms they'll understand).</p>
