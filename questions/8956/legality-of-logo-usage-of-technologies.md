I am developing a web application which will contain blogs/tutorials for various open source technologies. I want to use each technologies' logo and tagline on my index page.

Is it legal?

<p><strong>No</strong>  </p>

<p>Most or all the open source software has organizational support who define and frame the trademark laws in order to help with trademark abuse. They aren't really very strict, though!</p>

<p>For example, <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/trademarks/" rel="nofollow">this is the trademark details</a> for the "Python" name and logo.</p>

<p>So, you can go through the trademark details of the respective software you are planning to write about, and adhere to them.</p>
