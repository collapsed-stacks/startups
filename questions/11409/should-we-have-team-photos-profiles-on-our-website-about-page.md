We're a relatively small tech startup involved in creating virtual reality environments for businesses in the construction industry. There's 3 directors and currently no other staff. We're all relatively young (23-27) and our profile photos show that. The question was raised recently: 'Is having our profiles on the about page putting potential clients off as we could be considered too young or inexperienced to be dealing with large companies etc...'. Anyone have any thoughts on this? Also any research would be good to see as well if there's any around. I did look around but couldn't really find what I was looking for.

You talk marketing. There's a lot of *research* available or many aspects of marketing, but your task is not to comply with research but have successful business. These are different things.

I usually read contents very carefully. What I strongly did not like in your statements is

> There's 3 directors and currently no other staff

I would not work with company which would have three directors and no one else to do the job. Directors are expected to direct, not code or perform actual sales job.

> page putting potential clients off as we could be considered too young or inexperienced

It actually discloses your marketing strategy. IMHO it is wrong to expect  potential clients coming through looking at your profile on product or service website. Do you know your potential customer? If you do - do you actively contact / work with them to secure opportunities? If you do, you may not much worry who comes to look at your face on About page in order to consider your product.

Thus to conclude:

- know your customer profiles, go and actively search for them;
- not the faces and titles matter. Responsibility and good product matter. Thus instead of writing "John Doe, director of engineering" write "John Doe, responsible for success of our engineering". I think you got the point;
- photos actually matter, and it is an art to make a good photo to be like-able. Consult with specialists in this area to get professional photo showing that you are reliable, respectable, knowledgeable and nice. Show in your profile that being young is your advantage.

<p>Well, its not mandatory to have Photos of Key Contacts of <a href="http://www.datangle.net" rel="nofollow">Companies</a>. However, it will give proper representation about your company.</p>
