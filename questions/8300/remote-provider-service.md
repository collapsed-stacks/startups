Is there in USA something like remote provider?
I live in Europe and I wonder if I could introduce selling of my stuff having kept being in my home. For example I'd like to sell the toys that would be sent from USA to USA while I'm not in USA. I mean something like remote stock service plus delivering service.
How could it be done?

Yes , there are so many warehouses you can rent. Most of Bangladeshi business providers do that to run business in USA
