<p>No opinion on the incubator itself, but Xavier Niel is a solid patron and Paris is a wonderful city to live in if you can afford it.</p>

<p>The French startup culture is a bit different than the US/UK ones. Or at least it was ~15 years ago - I can't imagine it changed <em>that</em> much, but do take all of this with a grain of salt.</p>

<p>Off the bat, it's more elitist, in that you see plenty of Grande Ecole graduates and - let's get real - not much else (that succeeds, anyway).</p>

<p>Getting funding was much harder than it was in the US. I take it this improved in recent years, in that the French are reportedly less risk averse, but I still can't picture a French funding anything with a half baked business plan, and I can still picture the least risk averse of them running away to work in the US/UK/wherever like yours truly did.</p>

<p>The administrative environment is reputedly terrible, but that's simply not true: having lived in many European and North/Central American countries, I'd suggest France has one of the most efficient and competent administrations out there - it's <em>much</em> better than the ones that run the US and Canada, and their's are <em>much</em> better than those of their southern neighbors. As a bonus, there are state-related aids that you can request here and there when you get started.</p>

<p>Employment laws are different. It's not an "at will" place like it is in most of the US, so it's more expensive to fire bad employees.</p>

<p>That said, bad employees are not that common in reality: there's a strong emphasis on maths in the education system, and philosophy is mandatory in high school. Those translate into a general population that is well educated and very sophisticated. And as already pointed out, you'll find a lot of Grande Ecole graduates in the startup world - the competitive exams these grads went through a pretty good filter. The only minus here is a general preference for vague broad strokes over precise small details when making decisions (try Central Europe if you prefer it the other way), and a strong taste for perfectionism.</p>

<p>Also, French work very hard. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2015/jul/13/french-workers-more-productive-brits" rel="nofollow">Much harder</a> than Brits or Americans, who they typically outperform while working less.</p>

<p>The 35h are a thing of legend, by the way. The type of people who you'd normally hire in a tech startup will happily work 40+h weeks - as will most French if you pay them. They <em>will</em> claim their extra vacation time of course.</p>

<p>One bad aspect in my opinion is that if you're not from a Grande Ecole or a top university your access to good advice and opportunities is a bit more limited (because of inferior alumni networks, and <em>esprit de corps</em>). The same holds for early stage funding - which isn't that bad in some sense, in that few weak startups make it through the BS-detector.</p>

<p>Another potential one is cultural: where it's considered acceptable in the US to throw money at a crazy idea and drive a company into the ground while doing so (and then start over), you'll find it harder and harder to raise money if your earlier ventures closed shop.</p>

<p>A last point to keep in mind is market size and cultural variety. The typical route for US startups is to grow home in the (massive) US/Canada market, and then struggle somewhat as they try breaking into Europe. The occasional EU startup that makes it to the US finds the US market comparatively easy to enter: they've been localizing and addressing pluri-cultural problematics from early on, in order to get into all of Europe at the same time. The difference here being, of course, that by the time a US company enters Europe it has a sizable revenue, whereas by the time an EU one enters the rest of Europe it won't. (This may be less true nowadays, since you can be 100% online and start in the US <em>anyway</em>, but it used to be like that.)</p>

<p>All this begs the question of whether there might be better places to create a business. There probably are. But do they offer the same quality of life as the one you'll have in Paris?</p>
