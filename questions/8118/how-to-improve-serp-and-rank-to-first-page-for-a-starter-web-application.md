I have developed and launched a web application say a Retirement Planner. It is currently ranking in page 20 of google search page. How can I improve my SERP rankings and rank in the first page for keywords **"free retirement planner"**? So that I can get more traffic. and thus get some revenue out of adsense.

Now from the SEO point of view, I have done the following.

 - Optimised Title, description and keywords,
 - Tried to build backlinks but failed.
 - Since the page contains a form with many fields, It does not posses any content.

How to get listed to page 1?

<p>I suggest you start with the purchase of your top-level keyword domain name, which happens to be available: <a href="https://reports.internic.net/cgi/whois?whois_nic=freeretirementplanner.com&amp;type=domain" rel="nofollow">freeretirementplanner.com</a> </p>

<p>As you'll see in detail <a href="http://www.estibot.com/appraise.php?a=appraisal&amp;k=17a09886be882f235924d9a8ad6bf617&amp;domain=freeretirementplanner.com" rel="nofollow">here on estibot.com</a>, the keywords 'free retirement planner' are not heavily searched terms on a monthly basis. However, others (e.g.,your competitors) are currently paying $10.12 USD Cost Per Click, which  suggests this niche could, perhaps, be valuable.     </p>

<p>*For App indexing within Google Play Store, use app deep links to appear on the Search results page, in Android auto-completions, and in Now on Tap. <a href="https://developers.google.com/app-indexing/" rel="nofollow">As explained in-depth here on Developers.Google.com</a>  </p>

I am bot sure if this is the correct place for this type of question, as it is very technical and has more to do with the web app itself than the startup. However, I will try to point you in the right direction.

There are a few ways you can improve SEO for your web apps.

* Pretty URLs: to make your urls look like normal webpage URLs
* Google's AJAX crawling of your cache
* Editing you sitemap.xml file

These techniques are outlined in detail here...

Use high authority bookmarking websites. Do some classifieds. PDF sharing. Search engine submissions and write some useful CONTENT in article. But first you need to research on keywords and niche. Use proper meta tags. Geo tags. Country tags. Classifications tag etc. Use schema also. Hope it works for you sir. Thanks.
