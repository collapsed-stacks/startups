<p>I've read a number of articles and discussions on how equity should be split and it's clear that it's determined by a case-by-case basis and very much depends on the circumstances. I'd love to get some feedback on this particular set of circumstances:</p>

<p>A online marketplace startup is looking for a CTO to join.</p>

<p>The whole team consists of a founder with a business development focus, a co-founder with a marketing and business development focus, a graphic designer and two people who brings significant networking value. </p>

<p>Only the founders and the CTO will be full-time. The startup is very early stage and the CTO salary is very low.</p>

<p><strong>What would be reasonable equity expectations of this CTO?</strong></p>

<p>If I count correctly that's three full time founders if you include yourself.</p>

<p>So one third. (And frankly, no ifs, no buts. You're going to make it happen and you're going to be underpaid for a while to boot. So get IOUs in addition.)</p>
