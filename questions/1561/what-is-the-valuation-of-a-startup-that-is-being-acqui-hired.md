> Talent acquisition is the process of acquiring a company to recruit its employees, without necessarily showing an interest in its products and services—or their continued operation. The companies doing the buying say it is a talent acquisition, and it typically comes with a price per head.

The valuation is usually not much higher than the last round raised. The price changes but you can expect to get $250k-1.5m per employee that joins the acquirer. This number goes up for employees that have a phenomenal reputation, brand or skill. This is paid by cash + stock from the acquiring company. The acquired employees get stock that vests over a 4-5 year period, a small cash bonus, and a salary.
