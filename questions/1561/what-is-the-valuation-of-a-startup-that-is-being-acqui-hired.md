<p>The valuation is usually not much higher than the last round raised. The price changes but you can expect to get $250k-1.5m per employee that joins the acquirer. This number goes up for employees that have a phenomenal reputation, brand or skill. This is paid by cash + stock from the acquiring company. The acquired employees get stock that vests over a 4-5 year period, a small cash bonus, and a salary.</p>
