Our company has a mobile app (i.e. nice_app) that is increasingly building a positive image in different countries and gathering more and more users. This app provides content for children (stories, videos, games, coloring).

3 months ago, we launched a spin-off (i.e. nice_app_spin_off) of nice_app that is meant to be used by students. In nice_app_spin_off, we provide reporting for students activities, allow teachers to specify (from a web dashboard) which content items a student can view in the app. We are adding new features each release to add more value to nice_app_spin_off and distinguish it from nice_app.

Naturally, nice_app_spin_off has a very similar name to nice_app (aka brand extension, brand stretching), building on its positive image. The problem is that many of our nice_app_spin_off's customers go and download nice_app instead from the app stores.

What is the best practice to distinguish between nice_app and nice_app_spin_off, direct each client to download the correct app, yet not lose the advantage of our original app's name in the market.

p.s. Many of our clients are stay at home moms, and many of these moms have moderate mobile and computer literacy.

Thanks.

First off, it sounds like the spun off app could be renamed "nice_app - Teacher's Edition" or something to that order, in order to clearly explain what the difference is about. If you're a teacher and you see the two you'll know which one is for you.

There is the additional possibility that a teacher hears about "nice_app" but not its teacher edition. To address this, add a paragraph to your app's description that mentions the spun off app complete with the iTunes URL. And vice versa to send students to "nice_app" should they ever run into that one first.

Lastly, create a website and highlight both apps on it. Students to the left; teachers to the right. With the requisite download links in each case.
