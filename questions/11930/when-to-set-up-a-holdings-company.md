<p>Interested in starting my own business have been doing my research online about entrepreneurship, as I cannot afford college education, so forgive if I ask this question improperly ; I've been reading that starting a holding company is a great way to protect assets and capital between entities you control, my question is <strong>when should you start a holdings company should the filing be done before or after your subsidiaries are filed and already doing business ?</strong></p>

<p>Suppose I wanted to take $10,000 and put it in an a account for the holdings company, and lend $5,000, and also invest $5,000 to the start up ? Is this okay or what would be the process of doing something like this, With asset protection in mind.</p>

<p>I plan to start doing business in Illinois or Florida first. I am from Chicago, that is my home town but i spend the winters in Florida. however if this type of filling can be done in another state to decrease filling fees will do so.</p>

<p>In the scenario you mention, the holding company transferred all of the $10K to the startup ($5K in a loan, $5K as owner %). So, what assets are left to protect? </p>

<p>Regardless of when you create a holdings company, there is always going to be some kind of transaction between entities.  So if your holdings company provides a loan, what happens if it never gets paid back, or only some gets paid back?  There is no protection.</p>

<p>I would advise you to keep things simple.  You don't need to create a holdings company to start a business.  Just start a business.</p>
