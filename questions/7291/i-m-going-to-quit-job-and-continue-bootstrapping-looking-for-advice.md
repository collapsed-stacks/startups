I have a well-payed job (software engineer) and
recently I've developed an RSI so I cannot work on my side projects anymore, so
I decided to quit my job to try to make my dreams real by working exclusively on my own startup.

savings could get me through 5-6 months.
Does it worth to try? (i'm on prototype phase)

It depends how much of a risk taker you are. If I were you and I had confidence in myself to do quit a well paying job in order to make is big, by all means go for it! Don't burn your bridges at the company you are currently at, if you are well payed most likely you have skills that other people don't. Express to your boss or supervisor that you need to take a little break and talk about coming back to your old job if things don't work out! I would do that if I were you, unless you hate your job of course. I also prioritize my side projects more than my real ones which is a problem, but I would go ahead and follow your dreams and don't listen to what other people say.

Spend smartly though because you only have a limited amount of funds available and you can easily burn though those if you are creating a startup. That can be blown on server costs, advertising, etc. So be smart and pursue your dreams.

Congratulations! - I mean it - I did something similar a year ago. I am still working to make it happen. My current status - I am talking to merchants for field trial - I have a fully functional / usable prototype and all the marketing collateral and of course the pricing, biz plans .. in place. Everything keeps changing - anything that has not been revised in 2 or 3 weeks - I feel goes stale.

It is likely on a treadmill -no question of stopping - you have to keep moving - if you can run that is better!

Keep the option for part-time job open - 

As part of the expense - please factor in the healthcare costs too. 

'pm' me I can answer your questions -
