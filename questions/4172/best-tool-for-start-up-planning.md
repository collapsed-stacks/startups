I'm kinda looking for my "dream tool" right now. I haven't found anything good so far, and I'm reluctant having to use a huge Excel file...

Startup projects often deal with the "time vs money" problem. It means, I can achieve this project with 4 people in 6 months, or with 2 people in 14 months, etc.

I'd like a kind of Gantt diagram that takes into account : financial previsions and HR too.

Is there any web app that would allow me to plan for tasks / financial and HR implications of those "macro-tasks" ? 

Thanks.
