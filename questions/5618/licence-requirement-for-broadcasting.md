What kind of licenses do you (as an individual) need if you wish to broadcast a live stream of yourself to a number of people globally and charge them for it?

e.g. a paid live lecture to any number of students situated globally

If a general rule doesn't apply in all countries, I'd at least like to know the requirements in India.

Any help will be appreciated.

No license required as long as you own the content. Don't broadcast commercial music, movies, etc. If you are thinking of something along the lines of the original Justin.TV, you are in the clear.
