<p>My company is issuing SAFEâ€™s: simple agreement for future equity.</p>

<p>How does an investor treat this for taxes?</p>

<p>Ok did some research on this. The investment itself is not taxable until there is some type of event/sale to realize Gain or loss.</p>

<p>There is no maturity, no interest, so it is not debt.  It is similar to a warrant.</p>

<p>When the SAFE converts to equity, there is still no taxable event.  But the investor would file an 83(b) to treat the equity as a long term asset and defer taxes to the future upon sale, when gain or loss is realized.  The tax basis of the SAFE is the amount of original investment.</p>
