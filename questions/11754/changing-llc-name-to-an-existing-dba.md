I am a manager of an LLC registered in TX 50/50 with a partner who would like to leave. I also have a separate DBA in my name. I would like to remove the partner from the LLC and change the name of the LLC to my DBA. Is there an easy way to accomplish this?
Concerns/questions:
- the DBA is already registered under my personal name; will it be possible to change the LLC name to the already registered DBA name? I am guessing not.
- is it easier to remove the partner, keep the original LLC name and change my DBA to point to the LLC?

You need to distinguish the entity type from the name of the entity.

You can easily change the name of your LLC but it will still be an LLC.

You can't convert the LLC to a DBA. You could have a simple contract to have the DBA buy all assets of the LLC from the LLC and then dissolve the LLC.

I think this simplest thing is to:

 1. Change the LLC to remove your partner so that it is a single-member LLC.
 2. Change the name of the LLC to your desired name (the name of the DBA).
 3. Do nothing with the DBA or perhaps dissolve it if you are not using it.
