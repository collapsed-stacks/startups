## How does number of subscriptions options correlate to conversion?

<p>I'm wondering if the number of options I'm offering is overwhelming my visitors. </p>

<p>I wanted to enable subscriptions (recurring payments) and access passes (single payments) to my app. I first implemented subscriptions, and about a week later, I pushed out access passes.</p>

<p>I only did about a week of subscriptions before the access passes, but it seems like maybe there was more interest in the subscriptions before the access passes. It wasn't a lot of data, since the site only has about 400 visits a day.</p>

<p>Is there any industry-accepted knowledge on this? Here is a pic of the options, and I guess I'm just wanting to hear if I should reduce this or if it's fine as-is.</p>

<p>You should consider doing split testing. If you have set up your Google Analytics (or equivalent) goals then doing AB/Split testing will help you identify what's <strong>right for you</strong>.</p>

<p>Create three or four alternative page options and allow the test to run for around a month at least. You'll quickly see what works best for your business. </p>

<p>I agree with @Nick about one month of fall through! And honestly one week is too small to check the subscriptions set perfectly designed.</p>

<p>Secondly, It also depends on the product that you are trying to convert! There are instances when the 1-day access is more than enough to get the knowledge or sometimes quarterly is also not enough. </p>

<p>There is always "right" amount of promotions. You cannot over do it or under-do it! I will suggest to go with 3, and then see how it goes. But yes, if you could share more about the product or the service you provide we may have better feedback for you.</p>
