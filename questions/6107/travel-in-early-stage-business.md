<p>We started a mountain bike tour company a couple of years ago. The number of customers is currently low but growing. </p>

<p>I was there for 2 months this year, but we only ran 2 tours (2 weeks) over a 2 month period then I returned for a family wedding. </p>

<p>We've got 2 more tours in September, but I'm debating whether to go back for them or to devote my attention to other sure fire money making back in the UK.</p>

<p>My point being is the business is starting to generate some money but not quite enough to fully make a living from which means I'm left with time between tours to do other things-  either work on the business website or find other work.</p>

<p>the situation feels a bit disruptive because  I'm straddling two worlds- that of the business and that of pursuing other work - they feel a bit like they oppose each other.</p>

<p>Any thoughts or clarifications please ask. </p>

<p>Maybe you're just a serial entrepreneur! And if you are you'll figure out how to run multiple businesses just as every other serial entrepreneur did before you.</p>

<p>Also look at your options. At first it might look like it's a 50-50 choice since you might succeed with one or the other, with both or with none. But it's not quite 50-50. Because if you leave and you fail and the current business succeeds you still lost both because you left the old one.</p>

<p>So from a pure math point your best bet is to continue this business and also start the next one. You can bump up the revenue a little to hire someone to do all the trivial work and automate all the business so you can focus on the next idea.</p>
