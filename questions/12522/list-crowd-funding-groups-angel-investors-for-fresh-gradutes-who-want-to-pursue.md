I want to startup a web service for a recruiting company but I need funding to pay staff members. Are there any crowd funding groups or angel investors who are specifically looking to invest in these sorts of startups ?

<p>Since you did not narrow your question with a geographical location, I would like to direct you to <a href="http://www.seed-db.com/accelerators" rel="nofollow noreferrer">seed-db</a>, which maintains a list of startup investment programs all over the world.</p>

<p>I doubt there are investors only looking for recruiting services. You'd have to pitch and listen to what they say. </p>
