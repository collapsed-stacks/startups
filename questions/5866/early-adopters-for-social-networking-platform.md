<p>I am looking desperately for a set of people with some common interests to be the early adopters for a social networking platform that I am developing. How can I find such a group? It will be great if they are from the same city that I am in.</p>

<p>That's actually not too hard: start by organizing a local meetup around the theme of your social network. Bring some food, invite interesting speakers/guests. Do whatever it takes to make the meetup worth attending.</p>

<p>I agree with <a href="https://startups.stackexchange.com/a/5869/5313">Alain</a>. Organizing a meetup around the theme would bring together like minded people and just exactly the people who would be potentially interested in your product. </p>

<p>However <strong>organizing the meetup will bring you "visitors". To make sure that those "visitors" convert into "users" offer them early adopter benefits</strong>. Make sure you reward them if they support you in this early stage. Give them benefits that if signed up later it would be harder to reach for a user (or maybe impossible at all depending on your product). Make them feel appreciate for supporting you now. </p>
