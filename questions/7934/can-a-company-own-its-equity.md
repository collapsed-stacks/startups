<p>Usually people own corporate equity. However, corporations are treated as legal persons. Then, it should be possible for a corporation to own shares of its equity. Then, in theory, the will of a corporation can be voiced by everyone in the company, and the corporate share can be distributed evenly to everyone therein by dividend.</p>

<p>Is it possible for a company to own some shares of its equity?</p>

<p>There's a special legal structure for this in some countries, e.g. a <a href="http://www.alternatives-economiques.fr/scop--societe-cooperative-ouvriere-de-production--_fr_art_223_31332.html" rel="nofollow">Scop</a> in France.</p>

<p>When not, you can achieve the same result by having a separate non-profit entity that owns the company and represents everyone within it.</p>
