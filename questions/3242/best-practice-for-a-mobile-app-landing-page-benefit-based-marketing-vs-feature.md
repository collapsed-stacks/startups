<p>I've just launched my app's landing page with a benefits based marketing approach.</p>

<p>The initial feedback I get is good and I have a good conversion rates for a first version, but some people say that they don't understand exactly what the app actually does. Do you thing that I should see this as a problem? (The conversion that I am looking for is sign up emails for a pre-released product.)</p>

<p>I will be happy to hear your thoughts and learn from your experience. Especially if someone here have tested head to head the benefit based marketing VS feature based marketing approaches.</p>

<p>Market to the emotional benefits. Your site should make people think about their own experiences... and then their experience of sharing with others. </p>

<p>So, what about articulating the way your app works? The main visual (ocean pic) on your website is vague. Maybe you could use a collection of visuals or a slider to show the experiences that people would typically want to share, while blending graphics and copy with the visuals to show how the process of sharing them (using your app), unfolds. You want to achieve that "ah-ha" moment with the user, and as a result increase your conversion.</p>

<p>Ever heard of the "jobs to be done" framework? </p>

<p>Say you're supposed to send a message. There are many ways to deliver it: WhatsApp, Messenger, email, snail mail, or a Harry Potter owl. </p>

<p>Does it matter how the message was sent? Unless you care about the novelty outside the fact that the information was delivered, it doesn't matter so much how it was sent. </p>

<p>Customers <strong>never</strong> buy features. The ultimate thing anyone pays for is the non-negotiable problem to solve.</p>

<p>If it's negotiable how to send the message, they don't care about the features. </p>
