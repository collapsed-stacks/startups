## Should I buy domains for my Webapps If I launch an App every 2/3 Weeks

I am a novice Ruby on Rails developer and in a couple of weeks I will launch my first WebApplication. I expect to be launching WebApps targeting Laptops, Tablets and Mobile Devices every 2/3 Weeks and every .com domain costs around 10 Euros per year. I would avoid buying every domain for every app and using my Heroku Host Provider domain for startup, if the App starts being successful then I will buy a domain and redirect the current users there.

What are the disadvantages of this strategy?

Thanks
Fabrizio

I would first consider your long term vision for this aspect of your career, and how that relates to the individual app brands.  

For instance if you think your main brand is YOU and you will offer small tools and quick solutions as apps, but eventually want to be hired away by a big company, then you want one domain that consolidates all of these efforts and primarily focuses on you and your list of apps.  

But if you see each app as possibly separate company then I'd get a domain per app/company.

One disadvantage:  
Any other person could buy the domain name - and similar domain names - and "hold them hostage" so you have to pay them.

However, that other person would have to gamble that your web app would become popular. And they would have to buy _every_ variation on your app name, because it would be pretty simple for you to come up with a variation.

Another disadvantage:  
Some of your users/customers may want to use the app from a browser, or at least have an associated site (with a blog, product updates, company store, etc.) that they could visit.
