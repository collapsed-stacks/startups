## Should I buy domains for my Webapps If I launch an App every 2/3 Weeks

<p>I am a novice Ruby on Rails developer and in a couple of weeks I will launch my first WebApplication. I expect to be launching WebApps targeting Laptops, Tablets and Mobile Devices every 2/3 Weeks and every .com domain costs around 10 Euros per year. I would avoid buying every domain for every app and using my Heroku Host Provider domain for startup, if the App starts being successful then I will buy a domain and redirect the current users there.</p>

<p>What are the disadvantages of this strategy?</p>

<p>Thanks
Fabrizio </p>

<p>I would first consider your long term vision for this aspect of your career, and how that relates to the individual app brands.  </p>

<p>For instance if you think your main brand is YOU and you will offer small tools and quick solutions as apps, but eventually want to be hired away by a big company, then you want one domain that consolidates all of these efforts and primarily focuses on you and your list of apps.  </p>

<p>But if you see each app as possibly separate company then I'd get a domain per app/company.  </p>

<p>One disadvantage:<br>
Any other person could buy the domain name - and similar domain names - and "hold them hostage" so you have to pay them.</p>

<p>However, that other person would have to gamble that your web app would become popular. And they would have to buy <em>every</em> variation on your app name, because it would be pretty simple for you to come up with a variation.</p>

<p>Another disadvantage:<br>
Some of your users/customers may want to use the app from a browser, or at least have an associated site (with a blog, product updates, company store, etc.) that they could visit.</p>
