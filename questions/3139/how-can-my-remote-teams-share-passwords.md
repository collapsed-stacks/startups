<p>I am working online with a group of people on certain internet based projects.</p>

<p>This means we have made a ton of profiles in different sites and we need to all have access to the passwords and credentials for each profile.</p>

<p>What is the best way for us to share passwords with each other? Many companies seem to use Word documents or text files, but I'd prefer some way of them being a bit more secure than that.</p>

<p>We are using <a href="http://keepass.info/" rel="nofollow">keepass 2</a> to share test user and password accounts.</p>

<p>It is still not very safe (you still have to share at least one password) but it's free.</p>

<p>A commercial option (with some kind of "shared" features) is <a href="http://www.lastpass.com" rel="nofollow">lastpass</a>. It's not very expensive (~ $25/user/year). It also has a web-frontent and user management capabilities.</p>

<p>There are definitely a lot of more tools like this, those two are the ones we have worked with.</p>

<p>My remote team uses <a href="https://www.dashlane.com/" rel="nofollow">Dashlane</a> to maintain and share passwords confidentially.  Syncs nicely, has really simple sharing tools and has great mobile functionality.  Also lets you change all your passwords on lots of sites with one click which is pretty great. </p>

<p>If you go for it make sure to get the browser plugin.  Love it for generating passwords.</p>

<p>I would recommend <a href="http://www.okta.com" rel="nofollow"><strong>Okta</strong></a>.</p>

<p>Keepass, Lastpass, and Dashlane are more targeted to consumers while Okta is focused entirely on businesses at <a href="https://www.okta.com/editions/" rel="nofollow">roughly the same price</a>. We did a comparison matrix and found Okta offered the most relevant business features, more customer support, and more regular updates. It was easy to setup and maintain. They've also raised $155M and are reportedly near break-even so there's a good chance they'll be around for some time. </p>

<p>Btw, I have no affiliation with Okta beyond being a former customer. Good luck.</p>

<p>Well, yesterday We are testing a new logmein app named meldium</p>

<p><a href="https://www.meldium.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.meldium.com/</a></p>

<p>They said about:</p>

<p>This is your application launchpad where you can save your account credentials and sign in to apps instantly. Add your first app to get started.</p>

<p>You won't share password, but access...</p>

<p>It's perfect to us as a social media biz...</p>
