<p>I am going to publish an app on the App Store here soon. I physically reside in California. </p>

<p>Since my app does not have a physical presence, can I form the LLC in just Delaware or do I need to register in California as well?  </p>

<p>Trying to avoid expense, delay and complications; all of which I associate with the SoS and FTB in California. </p>

<p>The great thing about opening a business is that you are able to incorporate <em>anywhere</em> within the USA and then choose to <em>operate</em> <em>('doing business in')</em> as a business within any state upon completion of some forms etc.</p>

<p>So yes, you can form the LLC in Delaware, but you'll need to follow specific protocols to operate out of California.</p>

<p>I advise looking into this <a href="https://www.delawareinc.com/blog/delaware-llc-doing-business-in-california/" rel="nofollow">specific article about Delaware incorporations</a> that states some of those requirements, specifically for operating in CA.</p>

<p>You can't. Since you're physically in California - your LLC will be doing business in California and will have to be registered and pay the LLC fee. So why registering in an <em>additional</em> state? Pay <em>additional</em> fees? You'll need to maintain registered agent in DE, file annual reports, pay fees - why? You're saving nothing and paying more.</p>

<p>Just register in CA.</p>
