<p>There are a lot more variables that determine the price of the page.</p>

<p>For example, an US based fbpage will sell for much more than a German based fbpage. Geographic location, age group, page type, niche, amount of fans/likes/followers greatly affect the bottom line.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://claireroach.hubpages.com/hub/Selling-your-Facebook-page" rel="nofollow">research</a> the price of a Facebook page is roughly Â£1000 for every 100,000 likes.</p>

<p>What I recommend is that do a trial. Advertise on that page a few times and see how many downloads you get for each ad. You must have some kind of a user acquisition cost(uac) number in your mind. </p>

<p>Then calculate all of your costs &amp; profits and make a wise decision.</p>

<p><strong>Example calculation:</strong></p>

<p>Advertising(fb/twitter ads) user acquisition cost is 2$ and with the personnel(salary) etc. lets say 3$
This is your base line.
Each time you advertise 100 new installs come and the page contains around 200k monthly engaging user(not followers). You cant advertise a lot, only 3 times a week or people will unfollow the page.</p>

<p>3*100 = 300 installs per week = 1200 installs per month
Normally(fb/twitter ads) this would cost you 3600$.</p>

<p>You have to spend time to post new content and keep the page active and growing.
So hire someone part time to deal with the page = 1600$ per month</p>

<p>So if you buy that page for 2000$ it will break even in 1 month and you will still have lots of users to get new installs from.</p>

<p>Make wise calculations &amp; play it safe, don't go over your safe number and try to buy it for as small as possible.</p>

<p>All in all a page is truly only worth what someone's willing to pay for it...</p>

Before you decide to invest in buying a Facebook page I think you need to take into account how useful will it be for your android app to target the fans of the page.

After the recent newsfeed changes at Facebook, there is not much value in maintaining a Facebook page for your brand. Your posts on the page are only shown to less than 5% of the total number of fans. You will need to pay Facebook to boost your posts if you want to reach all your fans. It makes more sense to build your fan base where you can control it and avoid using Facebook for this purpose.
