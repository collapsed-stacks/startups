What are your thoughts on advertising one's company on his personal vehicle (e.g. with auto wrap or vinyl decals) and paying yourself from company funds for that advertising?  Specifically, I'm wondering is would be allowed, and is there a reasonable amount that I could pay myself from my company for this marketing service?

You can definitely have your personal car used for advertising (as could anyone who owns a car for any company). As far as whether or not you can pay yourself for this service, you would need to ask a lawyer, but I don't see why you couldn't since you would be able to pay someone else to do it for you on their card. However, as @Boston Startup CFO mentioned, why not just pay yourself more if it is your company?

Something to keep in mind. You should be sure that it is legal to drive around and park in residential areas since this is advertising. There may be laws or variances preventing you from parking a car with advertising on it. Again, be sure to check with a lawyer.

You can certainly expense the cost of the auto wrap or vinyl decals as relevant expenses.  But you cannot pay yourself for simply driving your personal vehicle. If you had a business that provided this service for other companies, then that would be allowed.  But why not just pay yourself more?  The cash coming out of your business is the same, and it is still personal revenue to you.

Always check with your CPA or tax firm for any questions about what is allowable.
