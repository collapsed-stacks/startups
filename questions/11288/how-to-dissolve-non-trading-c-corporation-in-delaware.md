About 3 years ago I used an online company registration service to setup a type C Corporation in the state of Delaware, but haven't done any trading yet and it's unlikely that it will trade in the US anytime soon.

In order to avoid paying maintenance fees and taxes (already paid some late fee penalties) I'd like to dissolve the company.

I've found several checklists about dissolving a company in the US, but also seen mentioned that the process for non-trading companies is normally streamlined.

What are the required steps in the streamlined process that applies to non-trading companies?

Also, should I later decide to re-register the company, will the same company name be available? (provided no one else registered the same name in the mean time)

As an option, why not sell the shell and at least maybe recoup some of your money from it?  There are a number of companies out there that will buy your shell from you and resell it to someone else who doesn't want to go through the hassles of setting everything up themselves.  Check it out and see if maybe that's something you'd be willing to explore as an alternative to simply shutting it down.
