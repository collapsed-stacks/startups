<p>I want to write email and to suggest possible cooperation(to UK geophysical consultancy).</p>

<p>My idea was:</p>

<ol>
<li>to present myself</li>
<li>to explain why I have chosen this company</li>
<li>to suggest skype interview</li>
</ol>

<p>I work at University, so I am not a businessman.Is this the right approach or not?</p>

<p>That won't get much chance of getting read.</p>

<p>A more typical approach for cold outreach is:</p>

<ol>
<li>A compelling title</li>
<li>Give a compelling reason to continue reading from the very first sentence</li>
<li>Very briefly introduce yourself and what you're up to in a short paragraph</li>
<li>Ask for a meeting (suggest 2-3 slots directly)</li>
</ol>

<p>Ideally follow up with 3-8 emails for more of the same.</p>

<p>The last one should be a so-called break-up email, where you basically something to the effect of: hey, look, I think you should reply back but you're either not interested or are too busy; I'll just stop emailing you moving forward, but do reach back out now or later if you were merely unavailable.</p>
