I want to write email and to suggest possible cooperation(to UK geophysical consultancy).

My idea was:

1. to present myself
2. to explain why I have chosen this company
3. to suggest skype interview

I work at University, so I am not a businessman.Is this the right approach or not?

That won't get much chance of getting read.

A more typical approach for cold outreach is:

1. A compelling title
2. Give a compelling reason to continue reading from the very first sentence
3. Very briefly introduce yourself and what you're up to in a short paragraph
4. Ask for a meeting (suggest 2-3 slots directly)

Ideally follow up with 3-8 emails for more of the same.

The last one should be a so-called break-up email, where you basically something to the effect of: hey, look, I think you should reply back but you're either not interested or are too busy; I'll just stop emailing you moving forward, but do reach back out now or later if you were merely unavailable.
