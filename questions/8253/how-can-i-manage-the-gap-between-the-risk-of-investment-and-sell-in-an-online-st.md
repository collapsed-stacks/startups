Suppose, I want to import product from China and sell it to the local market through an online business.

First, I establish an web-site. Then, I import product from China and keep it in my store hoping to sell.

But, later it turns out that, buyers are not interested in my product and I cannot sell my stock.

My first question is, (1) What would I do with those stock if those are not sold? (2) Can I avoid the risk of investment and not getting the return, i.e. is there any way so that I can avoid stocking and there by not losing my money?

Yes. You can avoid stock costs, by advertising the stock items, without actually buying the stock, and to do this

1. You advertise the amount of days for delivery.  eg. if  your supplier will supply you in 10 days, then you need to reship it within your country, then you could advertise say 17 days delivery, to allow for your time.  or..

2. You could cut down this delivery time, and ask your supplier to deliver direct to your customers  address. 

If you need to buy stock, and  your supplier want you to buy quantity, negotiate a very small amount of items , to let you get started.  

Hope that helps.
