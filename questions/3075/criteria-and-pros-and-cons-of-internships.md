I've got a small start  up running adventure tours in the Caucasus mountains www.georidersmtb.com

I've built the website, we've got an FB community and page and we have a US agent who recently started to do some promotions. 

We are at very early stages in terms of maturity of a business-  e.g. just starting to get heard about, getting bookings, running biggers tours. So far so good.

However, we have a bazillion ideas and iterative improvements to complete which manifest in long facebook conversations, to do lists and tickets in a project management app. 

I'm limited by time and I'm the techie out of the 3 of us so I end up doing a lot of the design and tech improvements. There is also a lot of social media to run and I take some of the responsibility for that. 

I'm aware there is a big opportunity for learning for perhaps a local to help out with some of these tasks - e.g. an intern. Is this something that could work out and what are the pros and cons of this? 

Also we don't yet have a physical bike shop front or office per se (we do have a place where someone could potentially work) and there are shared offices available in Tbilisi. Any thoughts welcomed.

I'm passionate rider myself and owner/managing partner of a couple of small business. 
We run internships for several years now, and we are very happy with it, because:

 - we expand our resource pool and **we get more things done** than usual

 - FTE members of our teams learn how to work with entry level colleagues with the opportunity of hands-on usage of basic principles as **planing, follow up, delegating**.
 - with small investment (you can both use paid or unpaid interns) you already build up a **shortlist of future employees** or temporary help for peak work (I assume your business is seasonal). Once they graduate (interns are usually students) they will consider your company as an employer.
 - you keep enthusiasm high! Usually hard work (the common setup for a start-up) decreases motivation. When a young intern comes in he has a lot of drive. His high spirit will influence your team. 

 - they are not picky when it comes to routine chores. 
usually they are very knowledgeable with social media and will quickly pick it up! It may go to such a level **they will invest more time** than you request from them.
 - they provide quick word-of-mouth employer branding for your company

On the downsize:

 - you will have to **invest time** for managing them - your time or some of your colleagues.

 - not everybody is as dedicated as you might think, so expect to have failures. Our experience is that **40% out of our interns are really valuable**. 

 - they will n**eed some resources**, therefore indirect cost as any FTE: computer, workplace, tools and so.   

Bottom line - for a start-up it could be an easy way to face some of those chaotic time and set a stepping stone for future growth. 
If you **should find the passionate bike rider** who knows your region, you might even hit a jackpot.
