<p>I've got a small start  up running adventure tours in the Caucasus mountains www.georidersmtb.com</p>

<p>I've built the website, we've got an FB community and page and we have a US agent who recently started to do some promotions. </p>

<p>We are at very early stages in terms of maturity of a business-  e.g. just starting to get heard about, getting bookings, running biggers tours. So far so good.</p>

<p>However, we have a bazillion ideas and iterative improvements to complete which manifest in long facebook conversations, to do lists and tickets in a project management app. </p>

<p>I'm limited by time and I'm the techie out of the 3 of us so I end up doing a lot of the design and tech improvements. There is also a lot of social media to run and I take some of the responsibility for that. </p>

<p>I'm aware there is a big opportunity for learning for perhaps a local to help out with some of these tasks - e.g. an intern. Is this something that could work out and what are the pros and cons of this? </p>

<p>Also we don't yet have a physical bike shop front or office per se (we do have a place where someone could potentially work) and there are shared offices available in Tbilisi. Any thoughts welcomed.</p>

<p>I'm passionate rider myself and owner/managing partner of a couple of small business. 
We run internships for several years now, and we are very happy with it, because:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>we expand our resource pool and <strong>we get more things done</strong> than usual</p></li>
<li><p>FTE members of our teams learn how to work with entry level colleagues with the opportunity of hands-on usage of basic principles as <strong>planing, follow up, delegating</strong>.</p></li>
<li>with small investment (you can both use paid or unpaid interns) you already build up a <strong>shortlist of future employees</strong> or temporary help for peak work (I assume your business is seasonal). Once they graduate (interns are usually students) they will consider your company as an employer.</li>
<li><p>you keep enthusiasm high! Usually hard work (the common setup for a start-up) decreases motivation. When a young intern comes in he has a lot of drive. His high spirit will influence your team. </p></li>
<li><p>they are not picky when it comes to routine chores. 
usually they are very knowledgeable with social media and will quickly pick it up! It may go to such a level <strong>they will invest more time</strong> than you request from them.</p></li>
<li>they provide quick word-of-mouth employer branding for your company</li>
</ul>

<p>On the downsize:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>you will have to <strong>invest time</strong> for managing them - your time or some of your colleagues.</p></li>
<li><p>not everybody is as dedicated as you might think, so expect to have failures. Our experience is that <strong>40% out of our interns are really valuable</strong>. </p></li>
<li><p>they will n<strong>eed some resources</strong>, therefore indirect cost as any FTE: computer, workplace, tools and so.   </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Bottom line - for a start-up it could be an easy way to face some of those chaotic time and set a stepping stone for future growth. 
If you <strong>should find the passionate bike rider</strong> who knows your region, you might even hit a jackpot.  </p>
