<p>In some business-concepts a lot of user interaction is needed, meaning that the business can only be used if a minimum user amount is reached  (Simple example: Some kind of online market. To run properly, it directly needs at least a few sellers and at least a few buyers. Else the people trying their luck there will get uninterested as it lacks activity.).</p>

<p>How do you start running such a service/business? Just launching it and waiting for users (While maintaining ads-campaigns and other marketing stuff) would be its sure death (See example above).</p>

<p>How do you get a userbase not to start from 0?</p>

<p>You can start slowly if you are in a market with little or no competition. If there are no alternatives to your service or only bad ones people will still use your service. Try to get to the top of Google search for that specific service.</p>

<p>If you consider a market where there is strong competition (like Ebay for online selling / buying), then you need a very big (marketing) budget to even get started. And you will need something that makes your service unique compared to your competition. Maybe it is possible to specialize on a sub-market (i.e. only musical instruments) which you can cover better than a big company (i.e. very specific search options for instruments) and then grow from there.</p>
