I am creating my Indiegogo.com campaign for android game. My goal is not bigger than $350, but I am not sure how much I can really receive.

My resident is EU and I can accept only card payments. That is why I am going to choose USD currency so I will have to pay wire fee at the end. 

Is it possible to cancel Indiegogo.com payment in flexible funding if it does not exceed $25 to prevent loss on wire fee to EU? Let's say that I will receive $10. It will mean that I will have to pay $25 wire fee and I will be in loss $15.

I know that crowdfunding is also about risks but I could not find anything about it in indiegogo FAQ and I would be really thankful if somebody can provide some more information.

You have a few options. 

My recommendation would be to extend your campaign if you get close to the deadline and are still very low, to give people an opportunity to continue to donate. Here is the help article for that: https://support.indiegogo.com/hc/en-us/articles/216112178-Deadlines

If you have raised nothing, here is the right help article: https://support.indiegogo.com/hc/en-us/articles/527416-Deleting-a-Campaign

Unfortunately, I don't see a way to close a flexible funding campaign that has gotten money. However, you should be able to make enough to cover the Indiegogo fees if you have a compelling idea and can prove to backers that you can follow through. Be sure to read up on how to market this type of a campaign- there are a ton of great resources on that around the internet. If you approach people in the right forum or community in a friendly and non-pushy manner, and you have a good "elevator pitch", you'll likely get at least a few people interested. Have compelling rewards for backers and you should be at least somewhat successful!

If you are very concerned, reconsider your goal, and perhaps use a fixed funding campaign at a slightly lower target.
