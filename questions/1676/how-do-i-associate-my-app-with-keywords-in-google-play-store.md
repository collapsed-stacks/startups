[I have  an app in the Google play store][1]

The app should, ideally, appear when users search for "learn Java" or "study Java", or heck, even plain ol' "Java". 

In a better world, you could replace "Java" with "JavaScript" in the above paragraph too.

*I have mentioned the words "Java" and "JavaScript" in the app description.*

How do I go about getting my app to appear for those keywords on the Google play store?

Google Play shows you the apps according to their name & their description. So try to put your search words in the name & the description of the app (which you already have done). 

As you know there are many apps that use those keywords so Google Play lists them all by rank and there are a # of ways you can increase your ranking. 

The major ranking factors are as below:

 - **Downloads -** including total number and also momentum; incentivised installs are still available in Google Play and can help in creating a snowball effect, or at least send you to the next download interval (100, 500, 1000 etc.), which improves visibility.
 - **App quality -** including percentage of users who keep the app after installing it.
 - **Uninstalls**
 - **Number and quality of ratings and comments -** these are important to how an app ranks, so any dev should make the most out of any reviews they receive and encourage more. Staying in contact with your audience and replying to reviews and feedback is therefore important to the app’s success.
 - **Country**
 - **Keyword density and relevance in the apps metadata**
 - **Social ‘proof’ -** meaning how many times the app gets +1s on G+ or Likes/Shares on Facebook and so on.
 - **Number of backlinks -** make sure you include links to as many relevant pages as possible.
 - **Frequency of interaction with the app -** be honest, don’t build expectations that you can’t meet afterwards and don’t cater to the wrong audience.
