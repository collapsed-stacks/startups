To locate potential competing options, Google what your app will do and what types of problems it should solve. There's a good chance you'll discover something like it exists already, something that solves the same or a similar problem in a way or another, or even additional problems that it could solve and that you had not considered yet.

But don't let that stop you: there's an app for just about anything you can think of, yet a great many of them could have been made to do it _better_. You can take it from there and identify _a problem_ that consumers or businesses are _willing to pay to get rid of_ (as opposed to a nice to have) and do a _better job_ at solving it than existing apps.

Simple solution google it. If you found similar results that means your idea already exits. 

But that should not be a problem. Open those results and see what you can do in different way. Like online shopping is an idea but we all know what amazon and other website's are doing it in different ways.
