<p>The way I understand it, the US only taxes profits for corporations.</p>

<p>I live in Hong Kong and have a company there (I am not American), I also have a company in the US, that holds the IP of my startup.</p>

<p><em>(Case 1 : HK comp and US comp are separate)</em><br /> If the HK company invoices the US company for software outsourcing, does that count as a business expense ? (and thus is not calculated as a profit)</p>

<p><em>(Case 2 : US company owns HK company)</em><br /> Does the previous statement still applies ? </p>

<p>Your question is very vague, so it is hard to answer.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>All countries have different laws so I recommend that you
find lawyers and accountants in both countries.</p></li>
<li><p>It also greatly depends on what the invoice is for.</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can deduct the costs of operating your business. These costs are
  known as business expenses. These are costs you do not have to
  capitalize or include in the cost of goods sold but can deduct in the
  current year.</p>
  
  <p>To be deductible, a business expense must be both ordinary and
  necessary. An ordinary expense is one that is common and accepted in
  your field of business. A necessary expense is one that is helpful and
  appropriate for your business. An expense does not have to be
  indispensable to be considered necessary. <a href="https://www.irs.gov/publications/p334/ch08.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.irs.gov/publications/p334/ch08.html</a></p>

<p><strong>In simple terms:</strong></p>

<p>If Your HK Company is Renting a building to the US company, The invoice would be a business expense to the US company and a profit to the HK company.</p>

<p><em>Vica Versa</em>:</p>

<p>If Your US Company is Renting a building to the HK company, The invoice would be a business expense to the HK company and a profit to the US company.</p>

<p>Hope that helps, and good luck</p>
