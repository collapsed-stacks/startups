The way I understand it, the US only taxes profits for corporations.

I live in Hong Kong and have a company there (I am not American), I also have a company in the US, that holds the IP of my startup.

*(Case 1 : HK comp and US comp are separate)*<br /> If the HK company invoices the US company for software outsourcing, does that count as a business expense ? (and thus is not calculated as a profit)

*(Case 2 : US company owns HK company)*<br /> Does the previous statement still applies ?

Your question is very vague, so it is hard to answer.

 - All countries have different laws so I recommend that you
   find lawyers and accountants in both countries.
   
 - It also greatly depends on what the invoice is for.

**In simple terms:**

If Your HK Company is Renting a building to the US company, The invoice would be a business expense to the US company and a profit to the HK company.

*Vica Versa*:

If Your US Company is Renting a building to the HK company, The invoice would be a business expense to the HK company and a profit to the US company.
