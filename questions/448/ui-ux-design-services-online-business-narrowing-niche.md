I'm looking of starting my Online Service Business for working for clients / people, who need UI / UX Designers Services. I'm thinking about it for like 2 months already (so I kind of stuck of ideas) and I don't know how to better present myself and my services online.

I'm thinking to build a website, where I could show my past UI / UX (so basically it's a portfolio page), also add my services and stuff like that (basic website to show myself to future clients). But after planning my website and my services I thought of idea of narrowing my services niche from Web and Mobile UiI / UX Designer to ONLY Mobile UI / UX Designer. Because I saw that I much more prefer designing for mobile, instead for Web.

Is it good to do this kind of stuff to only narrowing my services to Mobile UI / UX? I'm asking this question because I see a bunch of UI / UX Designers (as a solo or agency, or whatever) whose are doing a really broad type of services for clients (it includes BOTH WEB and Mobile Design).

Maybe I'm narrowing it too much?


**EDIT** 

My main question:

IS IT A GOOD BUSINESS PLAN TO NARROW MY UI / UX DESIGN SERVICES TO ONLY DESIGNING FOR MOBILE? Basically, I want to do only mobile design services (as I said, it would include UI / UX design) and I want to remove Web design services from my offerings. 

Hope this clears some things out.

As a rule, *the narrower you pitch, the more you will resonate with customers* who want that one thing. If my lawn mower blades have blunted, I'm looking for mower blade sharpening, and someone who offers just that will be an earlier call than a service to sharpen anything.

With that in mind, I'd say you're not narrowing far enough. Tighten the focus to one type of project and one type of customer and you have a platform to learn.

I think it's fine. Narrowing down to mobile UX development is perfect. It's what you like and there is a market. As for your other skills use them as secondary services for customer retention. 

I.e you deliver a design, now you can ask the customer if they need it developed. 

If your work was good and the customer likes you, then you just saved them time and you secured another project. 

Hope that helps!

You might narrow it down even a bit more to mobile UX/UI design for startups. (And perhaps consider convertible debt as (partial) payment.)

<p>I rec'd an MS in Entrepreneurship where I worked with teams to develop detailed business plans. In the final Capstone class I was told 'business plans are bullshit and no one reads beyond the exec summary". Wax on/wax off, I guess. </p>

<p><strong>Prototype/sketch several <a href="http://www.businessmodelgeneration.com/canvas/bmc" rel="nofollow">Business Models</a>.</strong> I do this now as a structured way to work through startup ideas. You will have to consider many aspects of your business, discovering gaps in your thinking and things you may not have considered.</p>

<p><strong>Validate your paper ideas before you burn paper money!</strong> Seriously, embrace <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/principles" rel="nofollow">LEAN</a> and learn as soon as possible from <em>real people</em> who might be your <em>real customers</em>. We all have the tendency to focus on what is attractive to us but it is a pitfall. Your customers don't give a shit about what <em>you</em> like, its all about <em>them</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Try several variations and update as you learn.</strong> You might find out that you would rather go broad mass market/automated long-tail or niche for a premium.  </p>

<p>Hypothesize, sketch, validate, iterate. Just like a product. The book <a href="http://www.builttosell.com/" rel="nofollow">Built to Sell</a> is also a good piece of advice esp. for design service businesses.</p>

<p>PS, I have no idea of your background or if this is remedial or not. I am just sharing my experience with startups/investors and what I've found to work well.</p>
