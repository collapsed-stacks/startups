<p>getterms.io offers a free Terms of Service and Privacy Policy generator. Has anyone here opted to use (or noticed a website/web app using) their text (as-is or as a basis) for TOS or PP on their live or to-be-launched web app?</p>

<p>What is your opinion of it so far? Do you feel it is missing anything important?</p>

<p>For those who haven't seen or used it, I've included the generated text for a fictional company called "Star-tup" below:</p>

<blockquote>
