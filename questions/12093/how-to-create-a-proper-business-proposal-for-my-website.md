So i have this website it's a Social Network and Open Forum as well, and i am planning to propose this into our school and i am afraid that my business proposal letter will be end up crappy. And yes i created this site myself but i don't have any idea what to write in this **proposal letter** the most required field is **overview**.

You may rather Google *proposal formats* because, this question does not sound good here.

Along with this let me suggest you, in your case, you may just add the company details, client details, date, charges for each page (Home Page, Gallery, Contact Us,...) or else you can add an item directly to website development and write the amount. No need to getting into the details of the content of pages if it is a showcasing website.

**Better, Google for a good proposal format.**
