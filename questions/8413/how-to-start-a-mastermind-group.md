I'm the type of person that needs to work in the trenches with other people to get things done. I'm not just a team player, I play in a team. As someone who currently has no peers that have expressed interested in creating a start-up, how can I find and bring people into a mastermind group for this purpose?

Great question. The toughest part is actually finding folks with similar interests but complementary skill sets. Risk-seeking people who live off of the adrenaline of accomplishing great things are also hard to come by. Many new groups have been created in the Meetup application. This seems to be the best way to reach a group of people who might be likeminded. http://www.meetup.com/

All of this is going to be trial and error. You will meet people who, on the surface, act interested, but their heart may not be in it. 

If you've got an inspiring idea, and a solid plan to implement it, you can also apply to incubators. The people that you meet in the best incubators are among the most passionate and hardworking people, those that are willing to drop everything to pursue a great thing. 

Exact programs will depend on your willingness and ability to relocate, but rest assured, the marketplace is steadily becoming saturated with programs to connect entrepreneurial spirits like yourself. 

If you'd prefer to steer clear of what might be considered mainstream methods of meeting people, your best bet is to create your best prototype underground, and then showcase to the least judgmental and synthetic audiences that you can find. 

Stereotypical audiences will balk at a plan that lacks structured methods of making money, instead of looking at the market potential that will be driving the decisions on where to make money when it comes time. To rise above this, it will become necessary to sell yourself and your abilities. And in the wake of many failed attempts, you have to have the resolve and the confidence to believe in what you have to offer, forgetting about the people who thumbed their noses at the possibilities.
