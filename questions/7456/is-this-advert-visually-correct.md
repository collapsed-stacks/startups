<p>this an advert for a telecom company in Kenya, on first sight i can see the green cards! which is for a rival comanpany (competitor); couldnt it be wise to start the advert with the orange cards first (orange is the advertising comapany?). the green sim cards will bring the other popular company right into my thoughts and this may afffect decision making. in other similar adverts, in hughe billboards the sim cards are arranged vertically in pairs, still stating with the green ones.</p>

<p>Precisely. You read left to right. This guides you from worst to best and ends with the kicker.</p>

<p>(Where it <em>could</em> be misleading, in some sense, is that it doesn't say how much outgoing from green to orange costs to do a <em>proper</em> comparison. But consumers won't notice. And if it's really twice as cheap on same-carrier communications it's probably no big deal that they didn't.)</p>
