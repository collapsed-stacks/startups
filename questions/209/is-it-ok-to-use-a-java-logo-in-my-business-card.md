<p>I'm a software developer and I want to make a business card for myself. I want to enhance that I'm mostly a Java developer than any other programming languages, and I was wondering to put a Java logo somewhere on it to say so.</p>

<p>Is it OK to do so or there are rules that prevent me? Even if this is not illegal would maybe this be not advisable?</p>

<p>The Java logo is copyrighted and trademarked so unauthorized usage could lead to trouble - ie technically illegal and they could sue you. </p>

<p>Oracle is unfortunately <em>slightly</em> cagey about approved uses but they do have a dedicated email address for usage requests - javabrand@oracle.com.</p>

<p>You will have to abide by their <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/technologies/java/java-licensing-logo-guidelines-1908204.pdf">logo guidelines</a> unless you get specific dispensation to do otherwise.</p>

<p>By all means contact Oracle to ask whether you can use the Java logo on your business cards, but I assure you that the answer will be an emphatic "no".</p>

<p>Oracle do however offer an education program, under which you can be certified as an "Associate", "Professional" or "Master" in <a href="https://education.oracle.com/pls/web_prod-plq-dad/ou_product_category.getFamilyPage?p_family_id=48&amp;p_mode=Certification" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Java technologies</a>.  Paragraph 2.4 of the <a href="https://education.oracle.com/education/pdf/ocp_candidate_agreement.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">candidate agreement</a> states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Logo Rights and Restrictions.</strong> Upon completion of the applicable Certification Requirements and Your receipt of Your Certification Program Success Kit, and subject to the terms of this Agreement, Oracle grants You a non-exclusive, non-transferable, personal right to use the OCP Logo on Your resume, business cards, marketing collateral, letterhead and website solely in connection with Your provision of services in relation to the Oracle product line or technology for which You have a current, valid Certification Designation.  You are granted no other right, title, or license to the Logo or any other Oracle trademarks or logos.</p>
  
  <p>Your use of the Logo is subject to the terms of this Agreement and Oracle's Logo Usage Guidelines posted at <a href="http://www.oracle.com/education/downloads/ocplogoguidelines.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.oracle.com/education/downloads/ocplogoguidelines.pdf</a>, which are subject to change at Oracle's discretion.  You agree not to use the Logo in any manner that would diminish, tarnish or otherwise damage Oracle's image or reputation, or the goodwill associated with the Logo.  Upon request, You agree to promptly provide Oracle at your expense samples of any materials bearing the Logo.  You agree not to file any application to register the Logo, and not to use Oracle trademarks or potentially confusing variation of Oracle trademarks (including "ORA") as part of your company name, product or service names, or domain names.</p>
  
  <p>You agree that the Logo is owned solely and exclusively by Oracle.  You will not, at any time during term or after the termination of this Agreement, register or attempt to register the Logo (or any mark confusingly similar thereto), or claim any interest in, contest the use of, or otherwise adversely affect the validity of the Logo anywhere in the world.  You agree not to interfere with or bring any kind of action or legal or administrative proceeding in relation to the rights and title of Oracle in or to the Logo or any other Oracle trademarks or logos.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For example, the Certified Master logo:</p>
