I was reading on a [learning method][1] and I wondered, what are the subskills of entrepreneurship? What are the skills all successful entrepreneurs have or had to develop to become successful?

I know that customer development is one of them, what else is out there?

What I believe is that Entrepreneurship is not something that can be learned unless one also plans to change himself/herself for the better.

One of the most major skills/characteristics required are as follows with one liners of description.

 - **Leadership**: Everybody looks up to that guy, what to do next
 - **Management & organize**: You need to manage not only the team but yourself too, many starters forget this and then look confused.
 - **Visionary**: Look ahead, don't just get busy in doing what's to be done today.
 - **Problem Solver**: Doesn't freak out easily
 - **Good Loser**: When there's defeat/flaw in the product, accept it and solve it rather than closing eyes to it or start crying over it.
 - **Quick Learner**: Need to change process? Quickly gets his hands dirty
 - **Adapt/Pivot**: Similar to Problem Solver & being a Good Loser

 - **Good with numbers**: At the end of the day it's how much money did your company make
 - **Strategist**: If numbers aren't good, figure out a way
 - **Communication**: It's not about how good you speak but also when you speak(replying to an email with the right answer but after days will have no effect)

 - **Hard-work**: The most important
 - **Be your own critic**: Don't have some skill, find someone who can help you
 - **Ask the right Questions**: If you're asking the wrong questions, you'll get the right answer but in the end unable to solve the real problem.

These are the top level skills which ultimately leads to many more skills, but its better to start with a good base and then develop on
