<p>I was reading on a <a href="http://lifehacker.com/learn-anything-in-20-hours-with-this-four-step-method-509281792" rel="nofollow">learning method</a> and I wondered, what are the subskills of entrepreneurship? What are the skills all successful entrepreneurs have or had to develop to become successful?</p>

<p>I know that customer development is one of them, what else is out there?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Deconstruct the skill: Break down the parts and find the most
  important things to practice first. If you were learning to play a
  musical instrument, for example, knowing just a few chords gives you
  access to tons of songs. If you want to learn a new language, learn
  the most common 2,000 words and you'll have 80% text coverage.</p>

<p>What I believe is that Entrepreneurship is not something that can be learned unless one also plans to change himself/herself for the better.</p>

<p>One of the most major skills/characteristics required are as follows with one liners of description.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Leadership</strong>: Everybody looks up to that guy, what to do next</li>
<li><strong>Management &amp; organize</strong>: You need to manage not only the team but yourself too, many starters forget this and then look confused.</li>
<li><strong>Visionary</strong>: Look ahead, don't just get busy in doing what's to be done today.</li>
<li><strong>Problem Solver</strong>: Doesn't freak out easily</li>
<li><strong>Good Loser</strong>: When there's defeat/flaw in the product, accept it and solve it rather than closing eyes to it or start crying over it.</li>
<li><strong>Quick Learner</strong>: Need to change process? Quickly gets his hands dirty</li>
<li><p><strong>Adapt/Pivot</strong>: Similar to Problem Solver &amp; being a Good Loser</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Good with numbers</strong>: At the end of the day it's how much money did your company make</p></li>
<li><strong>Strategist</strong>: If numbers aren't good, figure out a way</li>
<li><p><strong>Communication</strong>: It's not about how good you speak but also when you speak(replying to an email with the right answer but after days will have no effect)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hard-work</strong>: The most important</p></li>
<li><strong>Be your own critic</strong>: Don't have some skill, find someone who can help you</li>
<li><strong>Ask the right Questions</strong>: If you're asking the wrong questions, you'll get the right answer but in the end unable to solve the real problem.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are the top level skills which ultimately leads to many more skills, but its better to start with a good base and then develop on</p>
