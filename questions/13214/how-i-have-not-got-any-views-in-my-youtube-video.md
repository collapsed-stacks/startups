I am currently making games videos, but it is not having any views. What should I do to get 10000 views, since monetisation will not be enabled until I get 10000 views.
Thanks!!!

It's a quite common misconception that simply having fresh content and posting it online will garner traffic and views.  Quite the opposite.  The internet is flooded with content, and visibility is a major issue without significant advertising expenditure.  

Short of spending money to attract traffic, you will need to get very active on social media and personally promote the content.  (This is the "elbow grease" method.)

Other ways to attract attention are publicity stunts, or getting mentions in more established media, which will raise awareness about your company and drive traffic to your youtube channel.
