<p>I created a Music Slots game, that shows youtube videos on the game screen. Now I am afraid to create a video of my app as it will include other videos from youtube.</p>

<p>I want to place game video in my app page on play store, what does Google policy says about it? Can I post my game screen video if it includes youtube window in it? </p>

<p>There are videos on You Tube available with a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/" rel="nofollow">Creative Commons</a> license. If you use one of these, your rights are already spelled out and protected provided you follow the licensing rules.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Search for a video on You Tube.</p></li>
<li><p>Click on the "Filters" drop-down</p></li>
<li><p>Select "Creative Commons"</p></li>
<li><p>Remember to check the license - you want to find a video that is allowed commercial use, and you may need to attribute the video somehow in your app page description if attribution is required.</p></li>
</ul>
