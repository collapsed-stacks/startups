<p>Imagine our startup company works on 2 ideas currently.</p>

<p>The founders and the employees in different layers work for the company, get their salary (in cash or IOU), and have respective amount of shares.</p>

<p>Now, one person (either founder or employee), suggest a nice idea to add to the company. The R&amp;D department evaluates the idea, and the board decides to add this nice idea to the company's line of regular works (production, sales, ...).</p>

<p><strong><em>Now the question is:</em></strong></p>

<ol>
<li>How shall the company reward that person who brought that nice idea? Cash or shares, or both? And how much % !?</li>
<li>How shall the company treat these idea-holders so that they get motivated to bring more perfect ideas to the company?</li>
</ol>

<p>Thanks a lot.</p>

<p>This is nothing close to what would happen in reality, tbh... If it's a startup:</p>

<ol>
<li>No sane startup would ever work on two ideas concurrently.</li>
<li>There is no R&amp;D department (or any department) - the whole startup is a single department.</li>
<li>Work contracts usually stipulate that ideas you come up with will belong to your employer.</li>
<li>Ideas are worthless without execution <em>anyway</em>.</li>
</ol>

<p>So really, the only sensible thing to reply in my opinion is: expect a tap on the back and a bone at best - delivering such ideas is your job. If you'd like to reap the real rewards (and take the real risks that come with it) you'll want to create a company.</p>

<p>Expanding on @DennisDeBergandy's answer:</p>

<p>The employment agreement should cover this.</p>

<p>Many startup employment agreements:</p>

<ol>
<li>Restrict employees from competing with the company.</li>
<li>Transfer intellectual property ownership from employee to company.</li>
<li>Compensate employee with company stock.</li>
</ol>
