<p>For 3 years, I have dreamed about re-inventing a kebab sandwich. Recently, I took over a shop in Denmark where I'm going to open the first shop of which I hope one day will be a chain known worldwide.</p>

<p>When I took over the shop, I also became admin of the Facebook page of the shop, which has around 120 likes and 15 reviews (14 five-star reviews, 1 one-star review). </p>

<p>My question is, <strong>should I create a new Facebook page, or edit the existing one?</strong></p>

<p>My plan is to spend a lot of money on promoting the page (and opening event with a good opening offer), and aiming to get around 500 likes in 2 weeks when I will open.</p>

<p>I would certainly keep a well-reviewed Facebook page. Reviews themselves are hard to come by, let alone 5-star reviews, especially at a proportion of 14:1. It seems like the previous owners did good work to earn those reviews (or they got fake reviews a long time ago when it was easy to do), and it would be foolish to throw them away. The reviews can also help you gain customers who may make the decision to visit your shop based on the positive previous experiences published on the Facebook page.</p>

<p>You should be able to make all the changes you need to re-brand the existing Facebook page, including changing the name of the page and the URI (facebook.com/<strong>this_part</strong>) if that's necessary.</p>

<p>You did not mention any goals on (re-)gaining the 15 reviews if you were to start a new page. While getting people to like a page (especially for a promotion) is easy, forcing them to write positive reviews may leave them feeling less comfortable. You also take a huge risk in potentially attracting 3-star or lower reviews.</p>

<p>Consider yourself lucky to inherit such a positive Facebook page and use it to your advantage.</p>

<p>Use the same page - reviews, likes - every asset matters. Change the url to the name of your new business. If the url was edited once before by the previous admin you can't edit it again, so then it's better to start a new page. Unless you'd like to keep the name of the previous business for your business.</p>

<p>If you can change the url and keep the existing page, for your Facebook Ads campaign you can target "friends of my followers" (don't remember the exact wording there). The reason behind is to target the network of the followers of the page, since it's a phisical location and most likely the followers and their friends are in proximity to the place, so they should know there's a new kebab place opening doors near by.</p>

<p>Btw, 500 likes can be easily achieved within a week with a small budget (ofc, depends on keywords and targeting).</p>
