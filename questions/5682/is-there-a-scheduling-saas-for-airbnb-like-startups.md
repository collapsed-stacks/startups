Is there any Software as a Service that allows middlemen startups (think airbnb) to schedule services and manage users, both customers and service providers? I've checked out SetMore and Front Desk and they all offer what I am thinking about, but directly for service providers (meaning they limit the number of 'staff members').

John,

You're looking for something like Bringg (bringg.com).

I finally found what I was looking for and I went through a lot, everything from SetMore to Dispatch and they weren't just right.

Thanks,
John
