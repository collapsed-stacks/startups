<p>Is there any Software as a Service that allows middlemen startups (think airbnb) to schedule services and manage users, both customers and service providers? I've checked out SetMore and Front Desk and they all offer what I am thinking about, but directly for service providers (meaning they limit the number of 'staff members'). </p>

<p>John,</p>

<p>You're looking for something like Bringg (bringg.com).</p>

<p>I finally found what I was looking for and I went through a lot, everything from SetMore to Dispatch and they weren't just right.</p>

<p>Thanks,
John</p>
