<p>There are people who sell their apps for a good amount of money. Some people even sell it on ebay for over a 100k. </p>

<p>I am interested in the tactics they are using to sell it and the motivation of the buyer.</p>

<p>You can use a business broker to sell your app. Or any business for that matter. Or you can approach a competitor in the space (usually a larger one) and offer to sell to them.</p>

<p>Buyer's will usually make that purchase to either eliminate a competitor (or a potential one) or to enter a space they are not currently playing.</p>
