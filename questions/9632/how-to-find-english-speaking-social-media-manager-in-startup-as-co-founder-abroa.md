<p>We are the team that consists of two Russian developers. I’m responsible for backend, my friend - frontend (iOS) and design.</p>

<p>We are keen on what we do, and think each little thing through. Now we have finished everything technical details: a server side, an application for iOS and all infrastructure (team works, documentation of API, work under load). And we are working up a question of promotion.</p>

<p>We have a business plan including ideas of monetising, competitiveness, promotion, etc. But we need a person who know English-speaking mentality, who live there…</p>

<p>We decided to focus on English-speaking countries (USA at first). We do not want to deal with Russian market (at least at first) for ideological reasons. </p>

<p>We are looking for enthusiast and can offer (at this time) just a share in our business (co-founder).</p>

<p>I try to post offers to websites about startups like startups.co.uk and startus.cc , but I really don't know, maybe there is way better?</p>

<p>Also I'm not sure weather I correct write the job what I'm looking for: Public relations manager. Maybe such employment type is called Social media marketer? </p>

<p>To find a co-founder that commits to your idea with the same passion is always better to have a personal contact. The best option is to organise a trip to Silicon Valley, New York, Austin, Boston, Seattle, etc (those are famous startup hubs in the USA) and visit as many startup events, conferences, meetups, etc as possible to meet people and get to know potential founders.</p>

<p>This is a rather expensive approach, so an alternative is to use online communities to e-meet potential co-founders. Some options are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Facebook groups, try to find relevant ones by using keywords such as: "find co-founders" "startup co-founders" etc. Ex: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/findyourcofounder/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Find your co-founder</a> Then post an appealing message to say what you're working on and invite anyone interested to contact you.</p></li>
<li><p>Tweet about it. There's the famous story how Travis Kalanik, CEO and Co-Founder at Uber found Ryan Graves over a tweet - Ryan stepped in as a CEO back then. This works well if you're influential or rich or famous or all :P</p></li>
</ol>

<ol start="3">
<li><p>Try websites like: Founder Dating; Founder Nation; CoFoundersLab, etc</p></li>
<li><p>Join relevant groups on Meetup and pitch to everyone. Basically, you have to pitch your idea to everyone all the time and eventually you'll meet your guy.</p></li>
</ol>
