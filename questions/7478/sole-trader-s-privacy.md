I'm about to open my online business soon and register as self-employed sole trader in United Kingdom, I reside in UK. I will meet my clients either in public locations (such as restaurants) or in their offices.<br/>
Note: I searched for similar questions and did not find any.

**Problem:**

My concern is privacy, I do not want people to find out where I live unless I tell them.<br/>
My `.com` domain only exposes my town, for `.co.uk` domain _Nominet_ requires verified address so I provided it but opted-out of _WHOIS_ so it's hidden from the public.<br/>
I did not register to vote, if I did my details would be available online.

**Question(s):**

If I register as self-employed sole trader and taxpayer in UK, will my address be wherever or however available to the public or to anyone who requests them from an organisation or a government department?

What possible DOs and DONTs would you suggest to ensure my address is kept hidden from the public?

**EDIT:**
PO Box does not do the job, RoyalMail may expose the real address per request.

For taxation purposes, our company's address is that of our accountant. You could, presumably, do something similar with your domain registration or post office box. Make sure you trust your accountant before doing this, you wouldn't want your domain to expire because they forgot to pass on a letter.

You may want to consider the message that you are sending your clients though. Trust is important.

BTW: We're in Australia.

Get a post office box for your business.  You'll need to put a business address on things other than your domain name. 

Also consider having a registered agent for your business with a street address somewhere.  This has a slightly higher cost, but is also a fairly commonly used approach towards the goals you're describing.
