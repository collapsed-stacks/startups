## Promised equity, never received option agreement, or any other paperwork besides one line on offer letter

I joined a startup 2 1/2 years ago and in the initial offer letter I received, I was promised a certain percentage of equity. It also says that it vests with a 12 month cliff and every month thereafter, and is totally payable in a liquidity event.

My doubt comes from the fact that I've asked multiple times if I should be receiving any paperwork, and they always assure me that it was just automatic, it's in the cap table and I have it. Are these red flags of being deceived into thinking I have equity to incentivize the below market salary I am getting?
