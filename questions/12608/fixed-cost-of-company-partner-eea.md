<p>I'm looking into my options of setting up a company/partnership in a country with the EEA (the EU countries as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) and was wondering if someone could point me to the lowest fixed-cost country (set-up costs and ongoing costs like, filing of tax and year-end reports as well as virtual office in any of these, with the exception of Ireland because that's where I live).</p>

<p>The company won't have any employees and will sell IT solutions for companies and individuals, so employee wages don't factor.</p>

<p>I know that in Ireland, the setup costs are relatively cheap, but ongoing costs like accountants and auditors are costly so I want to shop around.</p>

<p>Again, this is just in relation to the fixed costs - corporation tax and tax on dividends are to be disregarded here, and also sole trader isn't an option.</p>

<p>If you need more detail, please just let me know.</p>

<p>Thanks very much for any help you might be able to provide!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Look into Romania.</p>

<p>The costs of setting up a <strong>SRL</strong> (LLC), from the comfort of your Irish home, are the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>£55-£80 - fee for the 3rd party who sets it up for you. Ex: <a href="https://approd.ro/infiintare-firma-online" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Approd</a> (the cheapest I found)</li>
<li>£40 - minimum capital (which you'll get back right away)</li>
<li>£0-£200 / year - for getting a legal address for your business. This is the equivalent of a Virtual Office. Usually a Law firm, they will incorporate your company to their own address. You can also get a physical address from companies like <a href="http://www.kubix.ro/index_en.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Kubix</a>, those will give you more benefits. There are law firm who don't charge for this if you set up your company with them, hence the £0 cost.</li>
</ul>

<p>A lot of websites still display that there is a ~£25 government tax, but this was eliminated recently.</p>

<p>Take these numbers with a grain of salt:</p>

<ul>
<li>Accounting costs, starts at £40/year</li>
<li>Filing for taxes, starts at £100/year</li>
<li>Doing basic audits, starts at: £400/audit</li>
</ul>

<p>There are consulting/law firms who will take care of all of the above, keep your paperwork up to date including when there are changes in the law. The most reputable one is <a href="http://www.rolegal.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">RoLegal</a>, you can get a free consultation and price quote via phone.</p>

<p>It takes 3 days and you need the following to get it done:</p>

<ul>
<li>Name of your company</li>
<li>A copy of an ID card</li>
</ul>

  <p>I'm not a lawyer, this information might not be accurate, there might be other laws I don't know about, you should consult a lawyer.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> If you do all the paperwork yourself and have an address, the costs of setting it up is £0. The cheapest tax-filing/accounting service starts at around £12/mo if you're a small business (done electronically, probably automated). That leaves the audit costs which start at £400/audit.</p>
