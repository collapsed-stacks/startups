<p>I am an Application developer, and I don't like to work in offices sitting 9 to 6 behind an office desk. Recently I tried posting free classified ads in sites like olx, quikr and I got a few responses but the ad was ambiguous, some developers after reading the ad thought that I was hiring freelancers. I need suggestions on how I should conduct this freelance business and please mention alternatives other than freelancing web sites. I am thinking of placing some ads on Craigslist. Altogether I am a beginner with no prior business experience. </p>

<p>Thanks in advance constructive criticism will be appreciated.</p>

<p>Sites like Freelancer.com, Elance.com and so on allow a lot of such opportunities.</p>

<p>Although beware...office job 9-6 will start looking a lot nicer than Freelancing.
The competition is tough and deadlines are tougher.</p>

<p>On the side, create a facebook page and also host a website showcasing ur work(Most Important).</p>

<p>In freelancing, the visiting card is ur website portfolio. without that hardly anyone trusts.</p>

<p>OLX Quickr are classifieds for mainly products. waste of time if you ask me.</p>
