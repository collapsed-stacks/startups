<p>I work in higher education.  One of the hallmarks of working here is that we have a lot of freedom to explore new ideas in how we teach.  However, this has a downside - if there is a new idea out there, there is inevitably a discussion on how great it would be if we made our own version of it.</p>

<p>I have an idea that I feel has commercial potential.  It solves a problem that I face daily, and I feel that others face the same issues.  However, I'm not sure how to effectively communicate the value of the idea to the purchasers, who might say "hey, nifty, but we can make our own."</p>

<p>Realistically, most of the projects along the lines of "we can make our own" are poorly executed and either never work out or don't do what the commercial versions do.  We do purchase commercial things, of course, especially when they are industry standards.  How does a startup convince someone in this industry that something is worth paying for?</p>

<p>I don't know a solid answer to your question, but if you can show DIY-ers that they can save time <em>and</em> money, that will be pretty convincing.  If they could do it themselves cheaper, or faster, or (gulp) cheaper <strong>and</strong> faster, I wouldn't expect to make much money off of this.</p>

<p>You need to figure out and learn to emphasize the benefits you're offering. People don't usually buy features or information; rather, they buy benefits, answers, and solutions. In case it applies to you - and it probably does, based on your question - they also buy thrills.</p>

<p>Assuming this is some kind of course aid, consider communicating on two things: that the product benefits them in some way, <em>and</em> that they get to experience rolling out the product in their own way. For the latter purpose, include milestones, checklists, perhaps even alternatives to explore, etc. so they can do it themselves within the framework that you're putting forward ("have I done it right?").</p>

<p>Another consideration for you should be finding the right words for all stakeholders. Intuitively, you need to convince several sets of people when selling a product in academia: the actual end-users, i.e. the teachers, but also those who oversee what they do (the department head?), those who pull out the checkbook (the intendant?), and perhaps even the students themselves.</p>
