My question is while building the MVP, how to avoid ending up with something totally not useful for your customers. The following picture explains the problem better :

Find the answer by questioning your customers. Build the product around their problem and not the other way around.

In the picture you mentioned, the customers want a way to travel fast and with ease and not a feature of a car.

So answer the following questions

 1. What is the problem/need my audience is facing ?
 2. What is it that they want most ?
 3. What is it (unique or not) that I can offer ?

Answer the questions and build an MVP by sacrificing everything else in the product.

Aim for the pain point, and build from there. Proceed in two steps:

1. Which problem(s) needs to get solved asap, to the point where your prospects are itching to pull out their checkbooks before they even see a working prototype?

2. Which features/integrations do you need to add in addition, if any, in order to make it viable for your prospects to purchase your product *right now*? Make note of these.

This won't give you an MVP. It'll give you the *future* version of your product.

Now, add this third step:

3. Which extra features can you actually *postpone*, while still keeping the problem solved and signed checks coming your way?

Remove them all until you hit a sweet spot in terms of ETA and number of clients willing to buy without seeing a fully functional prototype. You now have an MVP.

And a roadmap for versions 2, 3, and so forth -- complete with a list of hot prospects for them.
