<p>My question is while building the MVP, how to avoid ending up with something totally not useful for your customers. The following picture explains the problem better :</p>

<p>Find the answer by questioning your customers. Build the product around their problem and not the other way around.</p>

<p>In the picture you mentioned, the customers want a way to travel fast and with ease and not a feature of a car.</p>

<p>So answer the following questions</p>

<ol>
<li>What is the problem/need my audience is facing ?</li>
<li>What is it that they want most ?</li>
<li>What is it (unique or not) that I can offer ?</li>
</ol>

<p>Answer the questions and build an MVP by sacrificing everything else in the product.</p>

<p>Aim for the pain point, and build from there. Proceed in two steps:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Which problem(s) needs to get solved asap, to the point where your prospects are itching to pull out their checkbooks before they even see a working prototype?</p></li>
<li><p>Which features/integrations do you need to add in addition, if any, in order to make it viable for your prospects to purchase your product <em>right now</em>? Make note of these.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>This won't give you an MVP. It'll give you the <em>future</em> version of your product.</p>

<p>Now, add this third step:</p>

<ol start="3">
<li>Which extra features can you actually <em>postpone</em>, while still keeping the problem solved and signed checks coming your way?</li>
</ol>

<p>Remove them all until you hit a sweet spot in terms of ETA and number of clients willing to buy without seeing a fully functional prototype. You now have an MVP.</p>

<p>And a roadmap for versions 2, 3, and so forth -- complete with a list of hot prospects for them.</p>
