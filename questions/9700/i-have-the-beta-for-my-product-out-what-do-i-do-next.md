<p>I have been working for a few months and finally have the first beta version of my product out. I would very much like people to start using it so that I can get their feedback and move forward with the development and maybe even get some funding.</p>

<p>Product description (incase it helps):My product is basically insurance for your website. It helps you protect your website 24/7/365 and automatically restores it in the event of an emergency. </p>

<p>My problem is that I am having difficulties trying to find people to use my product even though it is free to use. I have tried emailing small companies to see if they are interested in testing my product out but they do not reply.</p>

<p>How can I get clients to test out my beta (and hopefully become paying customers) and how should I move forward with my startup?</p>

<p>My suggestion is that instead of targeting corporate web sites for the moment, concentrate your efforts on small individually-owned sites, which are much less likely to have backup systems in place and would therefore be more likely to find your product useful.  Most corporate sites have failover and backup systems in place to do what it sounds like your product does, and what they have is integrated into their sites. 
Do you have friends who run/own their own sites and could potentially try this out for you?  This is where a "friends and family" network comes into play.  Ask around and see, because even if they don't need what your product does, they may know someone else who does.<br>
You could even try calling the technology news desks of local television stations and newspapers around the area.  Who knows, maybe it's a slow news day for them and they need filler, so your story could be useful.  It's a long shot, but worth trying.</p>

<p>I hope this is helpful.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>Target opinion leaders who have reach with LinkedIn Pulse, blogs or newsletters. Offer a free beta test for them and their readership. </p>

<p>Think in terms of marketing verticals, like "solopreneurs" instead of "internet marketers"</p>

<p>Create scarcity: Limit the beta to the first XX people.</p>

<p>Articulate what problem or pain your product solves.</p>

<p>I wouldn't approach Guy Kawasaki unless you've done a tech startup before and know how to scale fast.</p>

<p>Pick someone who will take your call or email.</p>
