In short, for my very first business plan which I primarily need for targeting funds, is it better to write long and detailed one or short one which doesn't provide so much insight informations about startup, but it's much easier to read.

If you are trying to acquire funds, I would recommend to make a) a very detailed business plan with - if possible - an outlook on the next five years and additionally a visually appealing but not overloaded PowerPoint presentation which you publish as PDF. If an investor can browse through this PDF, he shall get interested and want to read your detailed plans and how you plan to develop your company and especially: try to make it clear that you are able to give him back a greater value than he originally invested in your startup.
