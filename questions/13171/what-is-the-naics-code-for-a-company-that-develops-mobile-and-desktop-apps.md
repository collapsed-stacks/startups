I'm filling out the paperwork for filing an LLC and one question is what the NAICS code would be for the company. The company solely exists for selling mobile and desktop apps that I have created. These are not games, but rather apps for productivity.

Would 5112 (Software Publishers) be the correct classification, since I self-publish the apps I create? Or is there a better classification? Or would 5415 (Computer systems design and related services) be better? I'm not sure it really matters, since this is under a "survey" section that I think is just trying to better understand the companies in the region, but I figured I should be accurate.

If you feel like wasting money just for this answer, ask an accountant. And honestly, you do want an accountant, because they're oh so convenient when you need someone to deal with tax authorities on your behalf. But if it's just about this question, just don't.

Another way to look at your question is asking yourself who [expletives] cares? The answer usually is just about nobody except the economists working in your national stats agency.

Among the few clearcut exceptions on this side of the pond (Europe):

- Taxmen compare your returns with those with similar activities to fish out those whose returns are outliers enough that they require further investigation.
- You won't get surprise food inspectors on premise unless you're selling food.
- You won't get animal welfare inspectors unless you're operating a farm or a slaughterhouse.
- I'm sure the above list could go on and on.

The point though is, stop overthinking and basically slap whatever best you feel describes you and call it a day. Unless you anticipate getting inspectors based on whatever you declare, the latter has no relevance whatsoever.
