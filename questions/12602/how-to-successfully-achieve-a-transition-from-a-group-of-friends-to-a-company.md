I'm currently an IT student and I'm creating a company with other students of my university.

We have known each others from the start of our studies (which we are about to complete) and since the beginning we are friends.

When I had the idea for the company, they decided to follow me.

The trouble is that recently they posted things on a chat we use for work which would be ok on a personal chat but not on a profesional one.

We now are coworkers as well as friends prior to the creation of the project, and even though I believe they are professionals I want to be sure that this transition from friends to coworkers happen in the best conditions.

How can I make this transition in the smoothest yet effective way?

I don't see anything wrong with being personal friends at work. Myself, my co founder and our team chatted about everything and anything during office hours. Both face to face and on internal comms.

I feel it made us a better team because the work was not about the work but instead the improvement of the lives of all of us. Work was a means to achieve that so we all worked hard.

One thing that helps is having different channels of communication for different things. We used Slack, this let us have separate channels for different conversations.

General chat was for everything non work related, then we had channels for different business areas (sales, marketing, development etc)

It allowed us to keep noise on topics to a minimum and not lose specific thinking around things cos it was segmented. Whilst still allowing us all to be friends.

The culture of your business will depend on what you want it to be (collectively). If you want it silent and everyone focused then everyone has to be on board else people won't enjoy it, become unmotivated. I think the main thing to consider is if things are getting done.

If work is getting done and you're enjoying it then that's great. If it's not getting done then it needs addressing - and since you're friends, probably addressing carefully, in keeping with the group's current dynamic.

Discuss it as a group! All of you are smart. You can all speak openly with each other. If everyone discusses it - perhaps for several days, or even weeks - you will come up with an arrangement that works for the firm and that everyone is comfortable with.

The hierarchy of the firm will be paramount. Friends are typically equals, but this is YOUR business: YOU are the president / CEO / boss, and they are employees of the firm. Employees can be reprimanded or even terminated for insubordination. Your friends don't consider themselves "subordinate" to you, but in business, that will need to be an understanding.

(By the way - good luck! I'm envious of your plans! It sounds like a really fun endeavor!)

<p>I think it is important to talk very openly about individual expectations of the company and motivations (and you may not know this sort of thing yet!)</p>

<p>For any business relationship to work well, I think it you need to have a common understanding on a range of things, so talk lots, and be honest. Starting with...</p>

<ul>
<li>recompense - how much, how often, how soon</li>
<li>hourly time commitment - how much, will it tail off</li>
<li>key skills and skill balance - are all skills in the founders equally important - e.g. sales, tech development, support, finance, legal, etc.</li>
<li>what will outsource, what will you do yourselves and for how long</li>
<li>what are your visions for growth? Are they the same, overlapping or disparate?</li>
<li>what are your appetites for risk? If one of you is married and kids come along quickly, their risk perspective and their approach to money will change.</li>
<li>start with job roles in the business and map individuals to those job roles (not the other way around)</li>
<li>control - will you want to keep control of your business and how will that work if you want to build big and take on investors</li>
<li>what is your exit strategy? Always decide this when you start a business, it can change as the business changes, but it helps gives focus and helps you know more of "why" you are doing things.</li>
</ul>

<p>A key thing with formation is to build a solid legal framework, have shareholders agreements, NDAs. Remember that not everyone need to have the same level of position in a business, but can have the same shareholding.</p>

<p>If all of you are IT backgrounds, then actively look for assistance in the sales/marketing. Listen to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sioZd3AxmnE" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Simon Sinek</a>  ... he is a legend! but good luck!</p>
