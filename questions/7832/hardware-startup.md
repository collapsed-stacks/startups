I am trying to fund an idea that is totally dependant on Hardware unlike MOST startups which are built on software prowess. 
I want to introduce this idea in the most simple way to potential investors, without any actual item just to get their input and perhaps get them to fund me. So what is the actual document that I have to prepare to introduce the product to them? And any template if any... greatly appreciated.

<p>It's extremely challenging to get funding for a hardware startup without some sort of proof of concept. Is it at all possible to create a prototype? Maybe checkout <a href="http://highway1.io/" rel="nofollow">Highway.io</a>. Then you'll have shown your vision to the point where investors will feel safer funding you. They want to see that an entrepreneur has some financial skin in the game. Crowdfunding is another great option. It creates funding, buzz, and validates that your idea is a good one.</p>

<p>I know I am not specifically answering your question, but my experience is that no one wants to fund an idea alone.</p>
