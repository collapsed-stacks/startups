Recently I've developed a program for desktop PC which creates backup of databases from site and saves it into numerous cloud storages with restore capability (call it Z). 

After that I've decided to start software business and my first software must be Z, but I faced with problems: 
it's 2017 year on the street, now mobile and web applications are trendings, but desktop apps become a little bit outsiders. Where I can advertise my app (forums, sites, etc.), is this worth to use crowdfunding tools for advertise it, or exists a specific solution for desktop applications advertisement? 

Please, share your experience in promoting desktop application.

Thank you for your advices and time.

P.S. Sorry if a selected hub for the question is wrong. The more acceptable i found only Freelancing hub.

<p>Desktop applications have definitely gotten clouded out over the years; especially as a result of mobile and web apps. They still have a place though -- for certain users and industries. The key is to truly dial in a target and niche market, and seek to become the information/solution leader within that industry. </p>

<p>Software doesn't typically do well on crowdfunding platforms. I would suggest a strong content marketing strategy and SEO plan instead: </p>

<ol>
<li>Find the questions that consumers in your industry are asking,
and what long-tail keywords they are using to ask it.</li>
<li>Create great content to answer these questions, using your niche expertise.</li>
<li>Optimize your site so that it has more "relevancy" and
"authority" than other sites competing for the same keyword.</li>
<li>Promote your site to influencers within your industry. This will
generate strong backlinks, while building your reputation throughout
your specific industry.</li>
</ol>

<p>I recommend checking out this article entitled, "<a href="http://www.canirank.com/blog/startup-seo-case-studies-5-startups-that-crushed-their-established-competitors/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Startup SEO Case Studies: 5 Startups that Crushed their Established Competitors</a>". The companies featured in this post operate in vastly different markets, but have one thing in common. They were all startups facing stiff opposition from established competitors that succeeded by focusing on SEO.</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>

Network, network, and network some more. A product like yours sounds very much geared for industry and corporate usage. With that in mind you need to be cold calling, joining trade organizations, exhibiting at trade shows, and getting out there to networking events where your target audience is likely to be.

Start building a list of potential leads from these events and pursuing them. Don't harass them but do reach out. Schedule lunch meetings, webinars, demos to prove to them that what you're offering will have a positive impact on their revenue. It will take work and time.

Running an ad would be incredibly wasteful right now. You need to focus on getting in front of buyers personally until you get more established.
