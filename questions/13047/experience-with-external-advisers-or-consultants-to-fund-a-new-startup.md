I am funding a new startup. I have an existing company which is supporting all the initial operations. But the new company will have two more partners, so the distribution of ownership is a bit complicated. Anyone has experience with external advisers or consultants to solve this problem?
An external opinion (or several) could help to distribute the role of the partners and how manage risk, money, time and expertise.

It's hard to say without more details, but from the sounds of it you should look into incorporating the startup activity as a separate business.

How you split equity with your new partners upon doing so is mostly depends on how advanced your project is. In particular: do you already have proven market traction? You might find these two threads of interest if not:
