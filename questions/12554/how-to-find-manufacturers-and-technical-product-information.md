<p>I'm creating a product that needs a GPS, so I'm wondering how and where I can get one. I want to know:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is the GPS a hardware or software implementation? </li>
<li>If it is a hardware implementation, then who manufactures that hardware?</li>
</ul>

<p>The best way to do this is via <a href="https://alibaba.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Alibaba</a>.</p>

<p>You can place requests for free and you'll get quotes from multiple manufacturers.</p>

<p>Then, you can chat with them on Skype, and get all the technical info you need.</p>

<p>Good, both. Software and hardware can be implemented for GPS. However, you commented that the application is a clock. For reasons of ease, cost, ergonomics and design, I would recommend a software implementation. I do not know what kind of architecture, but if your clock runs something like Android it's pretty easy and cheap to implement</p>
