I'm creating a product that needs a GPS, so I'm wondering how and where I can get one. I want to know:

- Is the GPS a hardware or software implementation? 
- If it is a hardware implementation, then who manufactures that hardware?

The best way to do this is via [Alibaba](https://alibaba.com).

You can place requests for free and you'll get quotes from multiple manufacturers.

Then, you can chat with them on Skype, and get all the technical info you need.

Good, both. Software and hardware can be implemented for GPS. However, you commented that the application is a clock. For reasons of ease, cost, ergonomics and design, I would recommend a software implementation. I do not know what kind of architecture, but if your clock runs something like Android it's pretty easy and cheap to implement
