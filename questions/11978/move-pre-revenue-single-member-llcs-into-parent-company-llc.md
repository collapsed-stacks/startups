<p>I own a few single member LLCs. I want one of the LLCs to now own the other ones.</p>

<p>The ones in question are all pre-revenue and ultimately are a net loss every year. I think this is relevant in dealing with price nuances.</p>

<p>The main idea I get: write a document transferring ownership from me to Parent LLC. Despite being the ultimate beneficiary owner either way. Then potentially modify the new subsidiary LLC Operating Agreement. Then potentially file an amended article of organization with the state subsidiary LLC was created in, depending on the state.</p>

<p>My main question is if the transferring ownership document needs a dollar value attached to it, and if there are particular nuances to be aware of.</p>

<p>Ideally, even if I got a CPA to do this, I would like to have foresight into the direction and consequences they would also consider. Or that I would remind them to consider.</p>
