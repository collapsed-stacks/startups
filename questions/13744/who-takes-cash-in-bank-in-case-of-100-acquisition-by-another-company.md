A BPO which has been operational for @3+ Yrs is being acquired by another larger company to boost its strength. Its 100% cash buyout transaction.

What will happen to cash in bank. The seller is negotiating "X" multiple of its gross income as valuation of company which more or less is OK with buyer too.

The deal is getting struck on this one point of seller insisting to walk away with cash in bank (which is substantial say @30% of the deal price).

Any suggestions.
