<p>I am working on an app that requires the user to allow access to his emails. That should be getting more difficult after the <a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/04/24/stop-using-unroll-me-right-now-it-sold-your-data-to-uber/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">scandal</a>. 
Is there any way to guarantee that user data will not be mined like that? I am thinking of something like a <a href="http://www.tuv-sud.com/activity/testing" rel="nofollow noreferrer">TUV certificate</a> by some trusted third party but not only for the standards-compliance of the business processes like an ISO9001 but maybe also for the actual code and operations?</p>

<p>I know this sounds super lame but I wondered if you can get a seal on your site e.g. <em>"PwC conducted a thorough audit of our operations and certifies that your privacy is respected and everything is perfectly commeilfaut."</em></p>
