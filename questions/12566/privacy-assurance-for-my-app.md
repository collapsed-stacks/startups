I am working on an app that requires the user to allow access to his emails. That should be getting more difficult after the [scandal](https://theintercept.com/2017/04/24/stop-using-unroll-me-right-now-it-sold-your-data-to-uber/). 
Is there any way to guarantee that user data will not be mined like that? I am thinking of something like a [TUV certificate](http://www.tuv-sud.com/activity/testing) by some trusted third party but not only for the standards-compliance of the business processes like an ISO9001 but maybe also for the actual code and operations?

I know this sounds super lame but I wondered if you can get a seal on your site e.g. _"PwC conducted a thorough audit of our operations and certifies that your privacy is respected and everything is perfectly commeilfaut."_
