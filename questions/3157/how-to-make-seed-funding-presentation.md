<p>I have an information technology idea however I don't have the necessary funds to work on the idea. The idea is totally new and appreciated by many friends.</p>

<p>Now I want to get seed funding and in preparation I've watched many videos. I have found that I learn best from videos. I am still wanting more information about how best to do a funding presentation so some pointers would be appreciated.</p>

<p>I found a slide deck inspired by the "How to pitch to VCs talk" given by Dave McClure <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/slidesthatrock/how-to-pitch-a-vc-redesigned" rel="nofollow">here</a>. It suggests the following simple 10 slide format which is useful for pitching:</p>

<ol>
<li>Elevator Pitch</li>
<li>The Problem</li>
<li>The Solution</li>
<li>Market Size</li>
<li>Business Model</li>
<li>Proprietary Technology</li>
<li>Competition</li>
<li>Marketing Plan</li>
<li>Team</li>
<li>Money</li>
</ol>

<p>Your compelling pitch is introduced by your unique selling proposition (in startup parlance, that's an elevator pitch), and then needs to lay out:</p>

<ul>
<li>The opportunity (what are you solving?)</li>
<li>Your solution (how are you solving it?)</li>
<li>Your market analysis (what are its size, segmentation, competitors, potential partners, etc.?)</li>
<li>Your business model (based on the latter: how will you make money, and why will it work?)</li>
<li>Your traction (if any)</li>
<li>Why your team (why you rather than another team?)</li>
<li>Why you need the money (what do need money for, and how will you use it?)</li>
</ul>

<p>The most important point in there is traction, or at least the potential for growth. VCs invest in companies that have lots of high growth potential, rather than in what they label as "lifestyle" businesses.</p>

<p>As an aside, don't contact all VCs right left and center. Their hands are tied based on what they promised to do with their own investors' money. So only contact those that you know do seed stage funding, and ideally identify who in the company is most likely to be interested in the deal you have to offer.</p>

<p>(And contact angel investors, of course. There's far more of them so they're less likely to be talking to each other in order to max our their investment in your business.)</p>
