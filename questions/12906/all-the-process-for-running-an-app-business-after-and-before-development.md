Whats the next step to keep up the business after or before the app Development finished? 
Let's skip all the hiring, development, designs, publishing into server etc., Just wanna know whats the other must have steps? Here is my example:

- Should I Trademark name & logo (during or after development)
- Does my app name has to be registered under the U.S company name? Do I need a company to run app business?
- How the taxes work
- Do I need attorney just in case?

... is there any other steps I must follow? Thanks

Other processes to keep the business growing and which should be covered in your business plan also include:

 - Support required for onboarding of new customers and ongoing customer support
 - Marketing plan with attention on new customer acquisition
 - Product roadmap (new features, adjustments for product/market fit, pricing, etc)
 - How are you going to measure success (what metrics are you going to be measuring and monitoring)
 - Plan for addressing technical debt introduced in early days (e.g. you may make decision to implement a shortcut with a plan to 'do it properly' down the track.  Know at which scale the remediation work will be need to be completed by so you don't get caught short just when everything is going well.

**On Trademarking:** You should definitely trademark at some point, but unless you're worried someone else might snatch up the name/logo, it's better to wait until close to product release.  (This is because you have a limited timeframe to show use, or else have to pay for an extension.)

**On the App name** This does not to be registered.  

**Do I need a company to run app business?** Not necessarily, especially if you're running the company solo, but incorporation does provide some benefits in terms of limiting liability.  If you bring in partners, you definitely need to incorporate. 

**How the taxes work** This depends on the type of corporation you set up. 

**Do I need attorney just in case?**  It's always wise to consult an attorney, and to engage an attorney in setting up the corporation and corporate documents (bylaws or operating agreement, equity distribution documents, etc.  Ambiguous wording can really hurt you down the road, and a good lawyer is there to make sure this does not happen.)
