<p>I had an S-Corp that I closed down in 2013.  I didn't realize I needed to file a form 5500-EZ because although the assets in the Self Managed Individual 401K were less than $250,000, you need to file the form if it's the last year of the plan.  </p>

<p>I just now got around to moving the funds to a rollover IRA.  As far as I was concerned, I was 100% kosher.  Usually, you can leave funds in a 401K.  I'm somewhat nervous because there is a warning in the instructions for the form that says:</p>

<pre><code>The Internal Revenue Code imposes a penalty of $25 a
day (up to $15,000) for not filing returns in connection with
pension, profit-sharing, etc., plans by the required due
date.
</code></pre>

<p>See form:  <a href="http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/pdf/2013-5500inst.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/pdf/2013-5500inst.pdf</a></p>

<p>I could do any of the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Back date the form.</li>
<li>Put the correct dates on form and hope there are no penalites because (as far as I know) I have not failed to pay any taxes or done anything illegal or even "shady".</li>
<li>Simply not turn in the form.  After all, it only came to my attention recently that I needed to fill in the form.</li>
</ol>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>Thanks, Dave</p>

<p>P.S.  If there's a better group to post to, please let me know.</p>
