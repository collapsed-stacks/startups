I have established a business in the online gaming space. The business is new though somewhat known.

All google searches in the ballpark of finding partners for startups have resulted in dead ends.

How/Where can I find an experienced CEO to partner with and take this business all the way through funding and most likely the first few years. 

Any suggestions would truly help. Thanks

<p>Some ways where you can find a potential co-founder:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Meetups:</strong> In my opinion, this options stands at #1. And that is exactly why networking during such meetups is very important.</li>
<li><strong>Social Networks:</strong> Never underestimate the power of social networks like Facebook and Twitter when it comes to startup networking. You might want to have a look at <a href="https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/7397/how-can-i-build-a-solid-team-for-my-upcoming-startup-in-bangalore/7402#7402">one of my answers</a> where I explained about this point. Wait, did I mention LinkedIn too.</li>
<li><strong>Job Postings:</strong> An old and conventional way, but still effective.</li>
</ol>

<p>So, those are it. I have found my co-founder (Oh wait, he found me. I'm the CTO, he the CEO) on Facebook. I have explained the same in the answer linked above. So, these options pretty much work.</p>

<p><strong>An advice:</strong> Always select a co-founder whom you really know and with whom you are very comfortable.</p>
