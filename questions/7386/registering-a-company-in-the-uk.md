<p>I've been looking in to registering a company in the UK and I understand what I need to do in that sense.</p>

<p>What I'm struggling with is what happens after, if the company isn't receiving any money, let alone making money, do I need to still submit financial records (tax return, etc) as there won't be any financial records?</p>

<p>Also, will registering a company effect my current tax code?</p>

<p>Any other pointers for what I need to do after registering the company and what's effected will be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>If there is no trading involved, ie no revenue and expenses, you will have to file dormant accounts once a year. There is no limit on this nad you can file them for as long as there is no trading involved. </p>

<p>Filing dormant accounts is fairly easy and requires no additional software or knowledge. All you will have to do is to fill in 0 in appropriate fields on Companies House website. </p>

<p>And no it won't affect your tax code. As there's no trading. </p>

<p>Once you start operations you'll need to notify HMRC and register for corporation tax and/or VAT + PAYE. </p>

<p>If you register a company, you are liable to file tax returns. If you do not have income or expense, you will file zero-returns tax. However, I am not very well-versed with UK tax laws, but I am guessing that you maybe able to file zero-returns only for limited number of times. </p>

<p>Definitely talk to a tax-consultant for more clarification.</p>
