<p>I'm starting a markeplace(selling services) and I would like to have some kind of referral program. However, we don't have enough money to keep a refferal program like "invite 5 friends and get a service for free". </p>

<p>I was thinking something like a loyalty or cash back program. For example. Every time a customer buy our services, she earns X points. When she accumulates enough points, she can change the points for a free service. Is this too clich√©? I mean, everyone does that, right? So maybe that is not a strong sales point for our acquision phase. Is there any other way? </p>

<p>I'll assume you take a portion of the money each vendor earns. For example, if Carl Customer pays Vanessa Vendor for Vanessa Vendor's services, you take 20% of the money that Carl Customer pays to Vanessa Vendor.</p>

<p>For a referral program, you could tell Carl Customer this: "If you refer your friend Robert Referral, and Robert Referral buys a service from any vendor, we'll give you (Carl Customer) 20% off of your next purchase!"  You, as the business owner, would not lose any money since you got 20% of Robert Referral's purchase, and that would make up for the "loss" from Carl Customer's purchase. Plus you would get Robert Referral as a new customer!</p>

<p>You could also split the deal between those 2 customers:  Carl Customer would get 10% off his next purchase, and Robert Referral would get 10% off his <em>first</em> purchase.</p>

<p>If your vendors charge different amounts for their services, you should say that the discount applies to a service of equal or lesser value.</p>
