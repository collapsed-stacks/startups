I am working on an app/website platform that will address pain points felt by small restaurants. I have spent a lot of time building a quality product and I am nearly at the phase where I need to start getting it in front of more shops.

Given that I am a small startup, I can't feasibly approach everyone that I want to about this service I am offering. Is there a way to outsource the sales generation process and have a company do the cold calling and sales for me?

Yes, but it will cost more than hiring a salesperson. The restaurant business is rather simple. There already are a list of known players to a geographical area. Go to various restaurants and see who sold them their POS. Then contact those POS companies and speak to their salespeople. Some of them might be interested in working with you on commission. At the very least, they will know some people who might be able to sell for you.
