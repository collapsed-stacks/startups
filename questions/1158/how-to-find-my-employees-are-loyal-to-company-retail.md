**AGENDA**

What you could do is take a leave one day and try to see their behavior by asking a customer to buy products from your shop but really he checks out how your employee works towards your company.

**ENHANCE THE EFFECT**

If you want you could try to make the customer make them fall into pitfalls(wrongdoings) to check whether they are really working for your company.


**CONSTRAINTS**

This all depends on how clever the customer might be.But I don't know whether you can take a leave suddenly or if you take a leave if they are disloyal the next person they look is the person you assign formally.

That's why I suggest to take a person they don't know.
