I'm a Senior Software Developer in a Global Company, I'm ok with my job at the moment, I'm doing what I like and I'm giving the expected results for the company. 

BUT (there is always a but), I'm not happy at all, I'm considering to start my own company and I'm kind of afraid about the market and what kind of things I should take care, before even think to quit my job.

Sometimes I do some freelancer job it means that I have some customers already and I also have some projects in mind that I could start.

So, I would like to hear afrom anyone who had the same experience.

<p>I've made the transition almost 10 years ago when I was in a situation resembling yours - I was IT manager at a company in the life-sciences business. </p>

<p>Brazilian only advice: Brazil is not the best place in the world to quit your job right now: exercise your patience, you will need it (with the current economy and a bit of luck you will be fired and collect some compensation that you will also need later). Sometimes <a href="https://medium.com/libertando-voc%C3%AA" rel="nofollow">I blog about my experience in Portuguese</a>, you may find the article "<a href="https://medium.com/libertando-voc%C3%AA/5-enganos-mais-comuns-de-quem-inicia-uma-carreira-como-freelancer-91d9d1cae01d" rel="nofollow">3 enganos comuns de quem inicia uma carreira como freelancer</a>" particularly useful. If you are in SÃ£o Paulo, lets have some coffee.</p>

<p>I made a lot of newbie mistakes. If I had a machine that could message back in time, these are some links I would send to the younger me:</p>

</ul>

<p>My main mistakes?</p>

<ol>
<li>positioning myself as a generalist</li>
<li>selling my time</li>
<li>weakened my position in negotiations by becoming too invested in the sale</li>
</ol>

<p>Entrepreneurship is somewhat counter-intuitive and many of the qualities that make you a good employee at a global company will make you a terrible small business owner.</p>

<p>That said, I'm doing just fine so far.</p>
