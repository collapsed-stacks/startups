In my spare time, I have made a list of some useful online apps that I would like to develop, as a business student and certified web hosting professional. I would like to ask for the help of other programmers and developers, ideally students or recently qualified students, who would be interested in offering their time and input, to contribute to the development of my ideas into a tangible web application, or suite of web applications. I would like to involve volunteers who would not charge a fee for their services, as these projects would be to aid me as a student in learning how to code and also to demonstrate the value of new web apps as potential products, at this stage. With the right focus and techniques, tools and expertise, as a team, it is hoped that there would be new opportunities arising from our dedicated work, to develop professional web apps and software products, for sale or public distribution on the open source markets, which would aid in the identification of funding streams or new advertisement streams, marketing channels, etc. There would hopefully be opportunities for generating income based on the success of a pilot programme, perhaps initiating the development of a new tech start-up, however for the time being would be focused upon aiding students with their learning, in the addition to gaining new skills that could be added to their resume/curriculum vitae.
