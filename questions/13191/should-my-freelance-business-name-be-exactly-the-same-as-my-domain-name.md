I decided to use DianeDesign to register my freelancing business name. (My last name is way too complicated to spell and pronounce). Should my domain (if available) be DianeDesign.com (or .ie / .net or any relevant) or can it be simply Diane.ie? 

Thank you.

If someone hears about your company for the first time, and they want to look you up, they may type in "DianeDesign.com". I would make them match. (Most people would do a Google search, and probably find your site, but I think it's just simpler if the name matches! Plus, consistent naming reinforce your brand.)

If you're company name is Diane Design (or DianeDesign), then it's fair to say that people will enter the dianedesign.com URL directly. You'll also receive search engine strength for the direct match. You should also consider registering domains for common typos (ex: diannedesign.com).
