<p>I have a idea that, i will develop a file sharing website. most of the universities in my country do not have their own file/book sharing site. They mostly use google drive. But i want to shape it to a well arranged web application.  If I develop such a platform, will it be popular to them? 
How can i guess?</p>

<p>You should find a unique selling point which does make your product better than the other product - in your case google drive.</p>

<p>Best option would be to ask your target group if they are missing something (features, usability, privacy) within their current solution. That could be your USP in this case.</p>

<p>If you just provide another tool which does basically have the same functionality as existing tools, you'll probably not convince people from your tool.</p>
