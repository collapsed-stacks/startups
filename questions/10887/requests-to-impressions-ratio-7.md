I repeatedly get very low requests to impressions ratios (currently about 8%). I think I am doing something wrong with the ad configuration in the app. I run an interstitial for two events. Any advice on rectifying this would be very helpful.

<h2>Couple questions to ask yourself:</h2>

<ol>
<li>Is my ad copy successfully communicating a pain relief, or creating a gain for my target customer? ELI5: <strong>Am I saying it right?</strong></li>
<li>Am I sure I'm reaching my target customer by these channels? ELI5: <strong>Am I talking to the right people at the right time?</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Of course, you'd like to answer these questions with <strong>real validated data</strong>. Not just a hunch or guess. Think of experiments you could create to answer these questions.</p>

<p>This is a great chart from the Value Proposition Design book: <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/obruq.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/obruq.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
