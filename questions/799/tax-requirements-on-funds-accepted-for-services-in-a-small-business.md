<p>If I begin a small web business and I generate around 60000 a year, do I need to report this to some agency, government, IRS? </p>

<p>Or could I just accept the payments and transfer the funds into my bank account without any special filing?</p>

<p>What is the maximum a business can make before they have to report their earnings? </p>

<p>What if I don't register a business, would the 60k have to be filed as additional income taxes when filing for taxes?</p>

<p>For instance, if I am charging 5k a month for my services, and swiping credit cards and transferring this amount to my bank account, do I have to file this as income when I file for taxes?</p>

<p>Yes, you definitely have to pay taxes on your <em>net</em> income. You can deduct lots of expenses to bring your taxable income down. </p>

<p>If you incorporate then you need to do your personal taxes and your corporate taxes, unless you set up a LLC.</p>

<p>Lots and lots of details. You'll need professional help, financial and perhaps otherwise :)!</p>

<p>Yes, you are required to pay taxes in any jurisdiction that has the right to claim them (local, state, federal, etc) - and likely quarterly, not annually.</p>

<p>Please contact a tax professional for further information.</p>
