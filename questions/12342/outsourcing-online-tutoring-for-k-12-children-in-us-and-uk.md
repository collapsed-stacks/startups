<p>I am a software engineer interested in a startup. I read the success story of <a href="http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/outsourced-education-and-the-indian-tutors-who-will-teach-your-children-online-prvtdt25g89" rel="nofollow noreferrer">TutorVista</a>, I want to create a similar service from Pakistan (outsourcing tutoring from US to Pakistan). The market is huge as there are so many children in US and UK looking for cheap and quality solutions. I am planning following,</p>

<ol>
<li>Replicate everything TutorVista does in Pakistan.</li>
<li>Invest in Facebook and Google ads for getting students.</li>
</ol>

<p>There is no significant advantage I can provide that TutorVista can't provide. Should I try this idea?</p>

<p>Yes, Why Not?</p>

<p>I agree that the idea is being repeated, its sounds redundant. But if you execute and perform perfectly and do your <strong>own</strong> market research you can definitely become their competitors.</p>

<p>From the above reading, you can see what is needed.</p>

<ul>
<li>Dedication</li>
<li>Execution</li>
<li>Market Research</li>
<li>Market Evaluation</li>
</ul>

<p>This all, can actually help you build a better business modal. You can always reference <em>TutorVista</em> but you need also do your own part too.</p>

<p>There could be problems that TutorVista or any other wouldnt have seen, and you may find out and may try to solve that into your application. </p>
