I am a software engineer interested in a startup. I read the success story of [TutorVista][1], I want to create a similar service from Pakistan (outsourcing tutoring from US to Pakistan). The market is huge as there are so many children in US and UK looking for cheap and quality solutions. I am planning following,

1. Replicate everything TutorVista does in Pakistan.
2. Invest in Facebook and Google ads for getting students.

There is no significant advantage I can provide that TutorVista can't provide. Should I try this idea?

Yes, Why Not?

I agree that the idea is being repeated, its sounds redundant. But if you execute and perform perfectly and do your **own** market research you can definitely become their competitors.

From the above reading, you can see what is needed.

- Dedication
- Execution
- Market Research
- Market Evaluation

This all, can actually help you build a better business modal. You can always reference *TutorVista* but you need also do your own part too.

There could be problems that TutorVista or any other wouldnt have seen, and you may find out and may try to solve that into your application.
