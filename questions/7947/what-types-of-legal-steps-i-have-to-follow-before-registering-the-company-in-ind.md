<p><strong>b. What legal things I have to do before approaching VC?</strong></p>

<p>Answer: It is a matter of central Government although state rules are applied and when you will want to shift the base of the company from one state to another you'll have go through some procedures. </p>

<p>If your goal is to become an expert on the business side, take some time to look around this site, some of your questions are already answered here. Then split up the rest into separate questions. Also join one or more local business groups (meetups.com might help) and find a mentor. You also need to establish a relationship with one or more CA's and lawyers.</p>

<p>If you would rather focus on your product, find a partner that will handle all this. Or you could both do product and business sides together.</p>

<p>Either way, splitting this into separate questions will help other people find each of the answers.</p>
