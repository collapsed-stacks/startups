**Is this valid URL to follow for registering the company in india.
If I register with Private Limited company (single person owner) then**

Answer : It is necessary to have at least two directors in one company whether it be LLP or PVT.LTD. 

**a. In future if I want to get the funding from VC then is
there any issue?**

Answer : No issue at all you will declare shares and divide among yourselves in the beginning and when new shareholder comes on board you divide them as required.

**b. What legal things I have to do before approaching VC?**

Answer: Nothing in particular required unless you are going into some peculiar domain that may require such help.

**c. If VC likes and Idea and ready to invest it, which steps I have to take means how to deal with profit sharing with them?**

Answer: For that you might would like to get a lawyer with experience but then again by that time you will be knowledgeable enough to have the idea.
 
**b. If VC thing don't get done and then If I want to sell some share of company to someone is that possible to sell it, like giving a some percent stake to some one behalf of finical funding.**

Answer: Yes, It is possible. 

**Is this compulsory to hire the CA for the Startup company?**

Answer :No, it is not compulsory but generally people take help of someone who has the experience in that area. 

**Whether we have to take the permissions from more than one government department?**

Answer : Depends entirely on your use case. Let's say I am into a start up business that may require help of physical labors then I must have labor license and related documents issued from the government. 

**while registering it , its come under state Government or the Indian Government?**

Answer: It is a matter of central Government although state rules are applied and when you will want to shift the base of the company from one state to another you'll have go through some procedures. 

Rules & Regulations of the region in which the company is being registered is followed but your presence will be respected on a national level.

If your goal is to become an expert on the business side, take some time to look around this site, some of your questions are already answered here. Then split up the rest into separate questions. Also join one or more local business groups (meetups.com might help) and find a mentor. You also need to establish a relationship with one or more CA's and lawyers.

If you would rather focus on your product, find a partner that will handle all this. Or you could both do product and business sides together.

Either way, splitting this into separate questions will help other people find each of the answers.
