The short word is PR, and it has nothing to do with spamming the press. It's a grueling, time-consuming, and very slow process. Think 6-12 months.

In a nutshell, the way to do it is:

1. Regularly contact journalists with extra information on the articles they write about your market. Politely provide corrections or improvements to what they said and be insightful.
2. Eventually, they see you as a reliable source of insightful information.
3. Eventually, they ask you to be a source for an article and mention you in an article.
4. You become an authority on the topic overnight.
5. Profit.

<p>Eventhough it's very open ended question, I will try to answer with limited scope. You can get the publicity for a tech-startup in the following ways:</p>

<ol>
<li>Taking participation in the Technical Seminars or Events</li>
<li>Setting up the stalls in the Tech. Events</li>
<li>Being actively involved in the Technical Forums and generating the good reputation</li>
<li>If you have lots of fund/money, then through advertisements</li>
<li>Making something very unique with Awe factor. For Ex: The startup <strong>OlaCabs</strong> and <strong>Uber</strong> offered so many free rides. <a href="http://www.groupon.co.in/deals/shopping/Groupon-India-Onion/408055" rel="nofollow">Groupon Sold Onions for 9 Rs Per Kg</a></li>
<li>Getting tied-up with Institutions and conducting some technical seminars related to your start-up</li>
<li>Again, if you have lots of money, Offering the on-campus placement to some one or two students with HUGE SALARY.. Every paper and sometimes even TV Channels will cover these kind of stories. </li>
</ol>

<p>In this, way, it really depends as in which community do you want to get the publicity. In the Students Community, Employees Community, General Public, Investors? Depending on that you should think about the ways.
Hope this answers to certain level.</p>

Sans billowing budget, you might try to find questions on Stack Overflow (even answered questions) in which your product might be seen as an alternative to the solutions proposed.  From that, you may cultivate relationships with people concerned about your product's domain.

There are a lot of strategies, but you definitely don't want to do them all. And if you do, you don't have the resources :)

Identify your objectives and the intended audience. Whom do you want to reach? What do you want them to do for you? Why?
