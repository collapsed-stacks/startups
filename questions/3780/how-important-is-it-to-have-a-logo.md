I'm thinking to start a new start-up, but don't know how to design a nice logo for it and also don't want to waste money with outsourcing. 

Is it required or important to have logo before we start the start-up?

It is not the slightest bit important. Don't waste countless days or weeks worrying about this stuff. Spend that time finding clients instead.

Use your company's name in a type you like. As long as it looks clean, it'll be good enough until you can afford to hire a designer.

Alternatively, there are ways to buy cheap logos. As in eLance or fiverr or too many others to list. Spend the requisite $5-20, pick one that doesn't look too bad, and call it a day.

If you are building a brand then it is important to have a fairly decent logo.
Keep it simple; you can always change it as your company grows.

However, if you're starting a retail store, it is not the most important thing to worry about.

**Try to keep your running expenses as low as possible.**

Perhaps you can use open-source software (also free online services) to design it yourself OR get a family/friend to help you.

*(Also get in touch with the Graphics Design Department at a nearby college. Students will do a good job for a fraction of what you would pay a professional.)*

I think having a simple logo is important and it can always be changed down the road.  If you use any social media or make an advertisement, its critical to have a uniform way to represent your company.

At the very least I suggest making a simple image of your company name, or the initials of your company, with any free imaging app.  You should have 2 colors as part of your company, so chose them now and use a basic shape (circle or rectangle) and put the text of your company within the shape.  Use one color for the border of the shape and the other for the text and make sure it is dark enough to be legible printing on paper.  Now you will have a consistent look and it will only take 5 min to put together and costs nothing.  You do not need anything fancy, but you do need a logo.

Personally I believe a good marketing and identity of your company is essential. So the logo is an essential part of this. You want to create an image that sticks so the logo has to be good and clean. 

Hire someone to create your branding or look at dribbble.com and logopond.com to get inspiration and design something yourself. 

You can also just draw on paper, photograph it and hire a illustrator designer to create a vector version of your logo.

Logo is one of the most important component of your business. If you want to be a visionary founder you should start to notice all the little details create the company's entire "stand" at the beginning to end of it -hopefully never ends-.

The logo will be your brand identity, it may not be highly important at your current stage, but if you are serious dont use fivrr etc. Keep it simple and not 'clip art' style. The font can make or break your logo and branding.

There is increasing competition online and users are becoming more aware of website design to domain authority.
