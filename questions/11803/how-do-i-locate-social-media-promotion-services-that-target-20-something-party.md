On an episode of Modern Family called "Blindsided", Haley Dunphy starts a business: She and her good-looking friends post pictures on multiple social media accounts (where they already have a lot of followers) promoting businesses.

My question is: do businesses like this exist? I need to promote an app I'm developing for the 20-something party crowd, and paying for this service would be well worth the money! I would appreciate any advice you have for locating them. My Google searches haven't worked out.

Yes they do.  If you search for the term 'Influencers' you'll find a lot more information on this and the ecosystem around it.
