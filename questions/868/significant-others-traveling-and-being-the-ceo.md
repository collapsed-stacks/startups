<p>I have a friend, I can't say his name for privacy reasons. He also can't post this himself because of the same reason.</p>

<p>He runs a small company that is growing quickly. He finds that he's traveling around the world more as time goes by to meet customers and employees, and sometimes he's away for a week at a time. At first it was every few months, but soon it looks like it might be once a month, something like 25% of his time (though I've heard of other CEOs being away up to 40% of the time).</p>

<p>This friend, also has a significant other. She's not used to being with someone who needs to travel so much, and finds it hard dealing with time apart.</p>

<p>How can one manage the travel requirements of a growing business and spending time with family or a significant other?</p>

<p>I see few options. First, take the family with and extend the trips a few days to take advantage of the travel. Travel, especially international travel, can provide rich experience.</p>

<p>Another option is set boundaries. Make it a rule not to travel more than x% of the time. It may come at the cost of less business. It can also be an opportunity to develop someone else in the company.</p>

<p>A great supplement to travel is video conferencing. Nothing beats face-to-face, but after establishing the relationship, video conferencing can work well. Skype is also a great way to stay in touch at home.</p>

<p>Finally, consider cashing out. Come up with plan that makes sense, with a goal of selling the business within the next year or two.</p>

<p>Unless there are kids, I'd just let things be, and if they don't work out, they don't work out; if there are kids, then he seriously needs to think about his priorities in life. </p>

<p>(<em>As for the question itself, it's likely not a good fit for SE, though I might be wrong; reason being that the topic is very subjective.</em>)</p>
