Meaning that you get $150/mo of Azure [services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/) per account. Azure subscription you get with BizSparks is not limited in any way, you can do what ever you want with it. Plus you can spread your infrastructure/computings cost over different accounts or you out of you pocket if you exceed $150/mo.

<p>I am not sure how much Azure credit BizSpark is offering, I assume it is 150 USD per month. Using the cheapest VM configuration you can run 10 of these for a month for less then the 150 USD credit limit. </p>

<p>Obviuously you would paye more for better configurations, but in conclustion:</p>

<p>Yes, it is possible to run up to 10 VMs for 150 USD monthly credit on Azure</p>
