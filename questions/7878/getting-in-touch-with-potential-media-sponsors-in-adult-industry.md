I'm creating a quick site for a project, I suspect if it finds any level of popularity, it will be on a "viral" lifespan: sharp uptake, sharp decline in interest. 

Ideally, I'd find a media sponsor. because of the content, anyone from the adult industry would be ideal. How can I meet those folks? AVN convention feels wrong and more like a media show than a place to do business. 

Cold emails/tweets aren't working. thoughts?
