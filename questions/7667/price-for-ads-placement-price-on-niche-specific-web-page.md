We have around 2500 unique vistors per month and we would like to place ads from companies that are related to this very specific market share.

We don't know how to charge. Should it be per visitor (something like 5 cents per visitor?) or a fixed price? 
Do you have any experience with this?

Try Google Adsense, I'm not to familiar with the marketing world but I know they are the lead right now in promoting ads directed upon certain sites. Advertisers will auction and the highest payer will get to have ads on your site, and you can set the starting price (And I think what kind of ads go on their as well).
