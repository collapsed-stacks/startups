I want to know the difference between these two words i.e. slogans and value propositions, and also I want to know how they should be created and organized for a full-service web development company. My second question is that how to use them in my advertising? What rules should I follow for that?

Slogan
=======

A slogan is a phrase or tagline with the purpose of being catchy, memorable and recognisable and is used to help customer's remember a company, brand or product. 

Companies create slogans to use in various marketing efforts (for a particular product or seasonal campaign, for example) in the hope that the slogan will stick in customer's minds. So, when a customer needs a product or service offered by a variety of companies, they are more likely to select the company/product that they are familiar with.  In this case, because they remember the slogan (providing it is a positive feeling) they will feel a connection.  A slogan can be a very powerful way of building 'brand recognition'.

In most cases, slogans don’t actually mention the company name or product, rather they focus on the benefits of choosing your product or service.

When writing slogans, aim for the following characteristics:

 - Memorable
 - Includes key benefit
 - Differentiates your brand
 - Imparts positive feelings

Think of "**Just do it**" from Nike or "**Because You're Worth It**" from L'Oréal

Value Proposition
=================

A value proposition is a statement that clearly identifies what benefits a customer will receive by purchasing a particular product or service from a particular company.

A value proposition is often the output of your business strategy.

Value propositions typically follow a framework, such as:

 - For (*target customers*)
 - Who are dissatisfied with  (*the current alternative*)
 - Our product is a (*new product*)
 - That provides (*key problem-solving capability*)
 - Unlike (*the product alternative*)

Difference
----------
A value proposition defines a company. Its purpose is to inform the way the company communicates, the way it designs products and services, the way the company grows.  ***It provides direction and focus to all business activities.*** 

The slogan is an artistic and condensed expression of a well defined value proposition, memorable and embedded in the brand personality.

For advertising, a catchy slogan is enough for your web-dev company. Something like "Website wizards at your service". This could be placed as your short descriptions on social media. You are also not limited to one slogan, you can have multiple, and there really are no rules on that - but having one that is catchy and memorable may serve to help your company's brand recognition.

A value proposition is made mainly to pitch to investors. This would include the problem your company is solving and how you are solving it. Nothing fancy about it, just simply "we solve problem X through Y".
