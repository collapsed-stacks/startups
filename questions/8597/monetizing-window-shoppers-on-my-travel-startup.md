I am the founder of a website that allows customers to input their budget and see where they can travel, based on the prices of flights and hotels. We also show users the ideal flight and hotel to each place, based on their budget.

We allow native booking (through an API with Travelport), but very few customers are doing this. Instead, they use us for inspiration and then visit an OTA site they're familiar with, such as Expedia, or directly to the supplier.

We want to monetize these lookeyloos. Ideally, I would show the real prices from my competitor, and then provide a link to book on those sites with a deep link to that particular hotel and flight. We would also like to earn a referral fee, rather than booking commission.

What's the best approach and partner to execute this referral program? I imagine it will require some collaborative integration with our partner, because we need to unload customers to the right page, with the dates, etc filled in. (I just found out about WEGO and Skyscanner, and I am waiting to hear back from their support team.)

Any idea how much a typical referral would be for providing the supplier with a relatively qualified customer?

Expedia has an affiliate program with cj/conversant. Just signup as a partner and they'll give you all the info you need to setup. It's usually pretty easy.
