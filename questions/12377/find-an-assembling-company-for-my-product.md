<p>I'm designing a simple product with a few electronic components (light, battery, switch, motor,...). </p>

<p>I have no trouble sourcing the parts for the product, and finding manufacturers for the plastic "case" that covers the electronics. However, I have difficulty in finding a company that I can send these parts to so they can assemble my final product. Where can I look? I would like the assembly company to be as local as possible (Perth, Australia), so China or Asia in general shouldn't be an option.</p>
