<p>The bank is quoting me $10 a transaction to send money to my vendor using electronic payment. I need to send $5,000 to $10,000 once a month to a vendor across the country. (Interact e-transfers only go up to 3000$)</p>

<p>Both the seller and I are in Canada and so far we've been using checks but I want to do it electronicly.</p>

<p>In the world of technology we live in there must be a solution to this problem.</p>

<p>From what I have read, many Canadian banks have a service called the <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/email-money-transfer.asp" rel="nofollow">email money transfer</a>. Apparently EMT is available at the Royal Bank of Canada, TD Canada Trust, the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, the Bank of Montreal and the Bank of Nova Scotia.</p>

<p>RBC seems to have a feature called interac e-transfer which they <a href="http://www.rbcroyalbank.com/products/deposits/interac-e-transfer.html" rel="nofollow">charge $1.50 per transaction</a>.</p>

<p>Investopedia has a <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0411/7-low-cost-ways-to-transfer-money.aspx" rel="nofollow">list of low cost money transfer methods</a>.</p>

<p>We ended up using paypal's '<a href="https://www.paypal.com/ca/webapps/mpp/mass-payments" rel="nofollow">mass payment</a>' solution. It wasn't very well published but it means we only pay $1.50 a transaction (no limit that we have encountered).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hyperwallet.com/features/global-bank-deposits/" rel="nofollow">HyperWallet</a> was another solution we came across but because it doesn't have transparent costing we opted for paypal.</p>
