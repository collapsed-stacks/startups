<p>I'm an Indian Citizen living in Australia (soon to be permanent resident). 
Is it a good idea to register business in Australia? or should it be done in India?
The only thing stopping me from registering in India is that they don't have a complete online registration system and needs my physical presence to get it done. </p>

<p>Please suggest.</p>

<p>When it comes to incorporating, your only credible options are the countries where the founders live. In your case that means Australia unless you've a cofounder in India - which will solve your physical presence problem.</p>
