I have an idea for startup, which is a new machine learning algorithm which can be used across the spectrum of ML market, where I have worked out all the math and mathematical proofs. The business includes implementing it in software, or designing GPU's and powering the all the applications of machine learning. You cannot patent a ML algorithm on its own, but you need to tie up with an market application and the race begins to apply it on a wide range of applications and start filing patents across the world. This would be a strong case for a startup to launch itself in a big way and be disruptive.

My question is, how can I get initial venture funding and seed funding? How can I hope to convince the investors. What kind of investors I should target, who can understand and believe in such an idea? (I cannot start on my own as I am penniless.)

I neither have any publications nor any achievements to make an impression before hand, (but have filed a couple of patents in a non-related topic) so I am counting on to atleast get to explain them and hope they understand the mathematical idea and its significance to Machine learning. What is the best way to atleast get to meet and discuss with an investor who is atleast remotely interested in this idea.

<p>For the seed funding, you can :</p>

<ul>
<li>Count on you friends, (ex) co-workers and family</li>
</ul>

<p>If you can prove that you are serious (or some people already know that you are), with a business model and a minimum working prototype you will probably find people willing to help you ! This might be the fastest way.</p>

<ul>
<li>Look for local initiatives / start-up challenges</li>
</ul>

<p>Depending on where you live and the willingness of your region to have a start-up scene, there might be some challenges that will provide you some resources. You may find some leads here <a href="https://www.f6s.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">F6S</a>. However, this takes some time to have all the paperwork ready for each competition.</p>

<ul>
<li>Look for Business Angels </li>
</ul>

<p>There exists some networks of business angels that are happy to support new ideas, help alumni from their schools... I would highly advice to look for a business angel network, not try to reach them one by one, as it can become really time-consuming...</p>

<p><strong>Side note.</strong> You seem to be alone in this project, and my feeling (just a feeling though, I do not have figures to prove it) investors prefer to invest in teams.</p>
