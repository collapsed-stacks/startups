The most important thing with KPI metrics is that they are calculated *consistently* within an organisation (in order that trends can be identified) and that their calculation methodology is clearly articulated to any user of it.

Personally, I might look at CPA in two different ways:

1. **Backward-looking**: what has been the average cost of acquiring *existing* customers?  Simply put, take total marketing expenditure and divide by total customers: thus I *would* include historical discounts etc in this calculation.

2. **Forward-looking**: how much is it expected to cost, on average, to acquire the *next* customer?  This might differ from the the backward-looking metric, especially as one builds goodwill&mdash;however, one might still include discounts (for example, where one estimates that *x*% discounts will be offered in *y*% of cases).
