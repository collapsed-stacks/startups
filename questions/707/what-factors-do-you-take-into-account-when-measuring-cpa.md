<p>The most important thing with KPI metrics is that they are calculated <em>consistently</em> within an organisation (in order that trends can be identified) and that their calculation methodology is clearly articulated to any user of it.</p>

<p>Personally, I might look at CPA in two different ways:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Backward-looking</strong>: what has been the average cost of acquiring <em>existing</em> customers?  Simply put, take total marketing expenditure and divide by total customers: thus I <em>would</em> include historical discounts etc in this calculation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Forward-looking</strong>: how much is it expected to cost, on average, to acquire the <em>next</em> customer?  This might differ from the the backward-looking metric, especially as one builds goodwill&mdash;however, one might still include discounts (for example, where one estimates that <em>x</em>% discounts will be offered in <em>y</em>% of cases).</p></li>
</ol>
