<p>I run a small pumpkin patch, but as the years go by and we begin to expand, I'm starting to find it difficult to keep up with security. We've had some trouble in the past with vandalism--nothing overly serious, but enough to cost me some money and make me fearful of what else could happen.</p>

<p>How can I secure the farm in such a way that I'll deter any unwanted visitors, but still not scare away potential business?</p>

<p>Obviously I could throw up electric fences with barbed wire, but that hardly fits with the lighthearted fun of picking up a pumpkin. The land is visible from one semi-busy road, so it's not overly secluded.</p>

<p>I generally hire a security company to watch over the place, but that's becoming less and less effective as my land coverage grows. I make enough to pay for the land and maintenance the pumpkins take, but for the eleven months out of the year that people more or less forget about pumpkins, it's hard for me to justify paying the fees of a team of security guards to keep things in order when I'm not around.</p>

<p>I've thought about installing security cameras, but I worry that those might be too much of an investment. And don't I still need someone there constantly monitoring them? I know lots of businesses use fake cameras, or a combination of fake and real ones, but how effective is that really? I've also heard that even just putting up a few cameras and a bunch of "Secured by <em>[company]</em>" signs can help significantly without incurring a ton of costs.</p>

<p>Take software as an analogy. No amount of countermeasures or resisting it will put an end to piracy.</p>

<p>Once this ticks, you aim for a level that you find acceptably low, rather than aim for eliminating it entirely. You also aim to keep countermeasure costs in line with (and ideally lower than) the extra revenue you get by implementing them.</p>

<p>Consider approaching securing your pumpkin field in a similar manner. You'll always have some theft.</p>

<p>"Secured by [company]" signs sound nice. So do "Smile, you're being filmed!" signs -- no need for any actual cameras anywhere, let alone real ones. Perhaps that will be enough to keep losses acceptably low most of the time? It's a very cheap and low risk investment, so certainly worth trying if it's in line with the losses you get while the security firm isn't around.</p>

<p>How is the wildlife in your area? One strategy may be to put up some short electrical fences intended to deter deer and other animals. </p>

<p>They wouldn't seriously injure anyone (although it definitely wouldn't feel good) and they aren't difficult to avoid, but it may give trespassers second thoughts. It also has the benefit of not having ugly barbed wire and also keeping out any non-human vandals.</p>
