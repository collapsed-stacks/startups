<p>I'd like to take over the trademark from a former startup. The former startup is in "completely dead" mode, eg. there are multiple news articles announcing its death.</p>

<p>Does it still have claim to the trademark, or do I have to buy it off them?</p>

<p>You will likely have to investigate this using a patent attorney.  Even if a startup is "dead", there could still be creditors that actually own the IP.  The creditors could also have sold off the IP to other third parties.  </p>
