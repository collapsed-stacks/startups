<p>I started a software development company last December and my partner and I have a few clients using our first software package. We are providing the solution for free, but we want a way for clients to support our company and our monthly expenses if they want to.</p>

<p>I have looked at several sites (mainly Patreon and Kickstarter) but they don't seem to fit our needs because we are not constant content creators like artists or youtubers.   </p>

<p>I have thought about using PayPal for a support system, but placing Donate buttons on our site may be misleading because supporting our company is not a true donation to a non-profit. We will be using the funds to cover expenses and pay checks.</p>

<p>What sites may fit my needs? Will a PayPal system that doesn't use a Donate button fit my needs?</p>

<p>I think you are making a mountain out of a mole hill.</p>

<p>If you already have a commercial relationship, ie, you made a sale, you can offer a support contract that is paid monthly by bank transfer.  It is likely safer and less risky and it helps you build trust with your bank when they see regular income (regardless to value).</p>

<p>Lastly, I suspect this other answer I wrote will provide food for thought: <a href="https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/8613/process-for-implementing-support-contracts/8615#8615">Process for implementing Support Contracts?</a></p>

<p>Best of luck!</p>
