I am willing to work hard and to spend whatever money I have.I DO NOT want to work for my manager or his mentor, I want to work for myself. But I donâ€™t know from where to start.I am a software developer.I also have `skilled team of developers` to help me in project. But the problem is how to get project and start working. Please guide me. I know it's a tricky/abstract question, but I don't know from where to get web projects or other skill related project and create a client base and start delivering.

You want to start a company that will do programming projects for other companies and people (especially entrepreneurs). Your challenge right now is finding companies and people who need your services.

It would make sense for you to find other companies that do programming projects for companies & people, and find out what kind of advertising and sales they do.

You may need to hire sales people. Focus on sales people who have connections to companies/people who would need your services.  Those might include law firms, accounting firms, and other "service" businesses that rely on software but who don't employ their own programmers.
