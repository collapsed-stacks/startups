<p>hello and happy new year!</p>

<p>I am in talks with a potential business partner in creating a game/software company. He has spent the last 2 years in his part time fleshing out the spec for the game/app he wants to create. He is getting ready to sell his current digial media company to start this new one. I work full time and am very happy where I am making great money and plan to work part-time on the new business until there is funding or high probable path outlined to success. I am an experienced engineering lead with 10+ years. He has given an initial offer of 10% equity which is vested after completion of development phases which he estimated over a 5-6 year period.</p>

<p>I plan on countering him with a standard 4 year vesting schedule and also a higher percentage, as my research shows that 10% would be too lwo for a dev startup where I'm the only engineer (it's just me and him). Considering I have experience with hiring and managing development teams, as well as obviously developing software I feel my value to be higher even though this is basically 'his baby'.</p>

<p>I've done lots of reading on here and see freqwuently some posts pointing to the calculator at foundrs.com. I'm wondering: <strong>has anyone here with real experience in the startup world reviewed or looked at this calculator</strong>? Can you comment on its accuracy based on your experience?</p>

<p>For what it's worth, the calc puts me either at 80/20 or 67/33 split in his favor depending how the questions are answered (there's still some grey that needs to be clarified). I'm wondering if I should hard counter at 20 or 30%... but I'm not sure if that's really accurate. Again considering that I am the dev and it's a software company.. although he is taking much more risk since he would not be taking a new gig while I'd be still full time employed. Keep in mind: I am truly only looking for what is fair, and at the end of the day, this project isn't about the money. I have a real passion for the proposed app and I feel excited at the chance to bring it to the world.</p>

<p>Thanks for any feedback!</p>

<p>The numbers in the calculator are mostly arbitrary. You'll find some here agreeing with it, others not.</p>

<p>Speaking personally, I resonate more with <a href="https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/1885/how-much-equity-should-a-partner-with-a-short-term-commitment-be-entitled-to/1886#1886">Joel's approach</a> to dividing founder equity. Two key points in it ring very true to my own ears (paraphrasing):</p>

<ol>
<li>If you are not committed full time on the project, then you are not a founder. Simple as that. If this is indeed your case then 10% is actually generous. (Do get paid, of course.)</li>
<li>If you are a founder, then you are in the same boat as the other founders and get the same share. Because founders <em>will</em> argue with one another at some point and the startup <em>will</em> go to hell if there's an "it was <em>my</em> idea" or what have you person around who feels entitled to have more say.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'd add a third point, which he doesn't quite insist on enough in my opinion:</p>

<ul>
<li>It doesn't matter if the idea originator chewed on the project for months or years. If they've nothing to show for it (aka actual pre-orders from future paying customers; not a prototype or sketches; even less a business plan) then this time is <a href="https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/7772/how-much-is-an-idea-worth">worth zero equity</a> - an IOU at most.</li>
</ul>

<p>Related useful reading as an aside for the founder agreement:</p>

<p><a href="https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/9060/tech-startup-ask-shareholders-to-commit-to-project-to-prevent-losing-equity/9062#9062">Tech startup - Ask shareholders to commit to project to prevent losing equity?</a></p>
