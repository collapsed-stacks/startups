<p>I have received numerous emails over the past several years from various investors interested in purchasing my company.  It's obvious they are trolling for deals, but I am wondering if anyone in this site has seen similar types of inquiries and if these are some sort of a scam?</p>

<p>Here is a typical email I receive.  They all have a similar theme...</p>

<ol>
<li>Seeking software companies with revenues $>1M (typically >5M)</li>
<li>Author of the letter claims he will move to our location and step in to run the business.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>I hope this email finds you well. I'm a Chicago-based investor looking
  to acquire one profitable and growing software company with $5-10mm of
  subscription or recurring revenue and I came across {your company}
  as a potential opportunity.</p>
  
  <p>To give you a little background, I started {name withheld} Partners,
  supported by a group of highly accomplished investors, to buy and
  operate one performing business with great potential. I personally
  would relocate near your headquarters and step into the day-to-day
  executive operating role, allowing owners, like yourself, to walk away
  from the business and realize an attractive financial payoff. This
  approach has worked a number of times and we’d be happy to share those
  success stories with you.</p>
  
  <p>We are focused on building on the foundation you’ve already put in
  place. We keep all the existing employees, maintain the existing
  {your company} name and grow the business to the next level as
  responsible stewards of the legacy you’ve developed.   If you’re
  seriously thinking about selling your business and looking for an
  optimal outcome, I'd like to set up some time to introduce myself and
  answer questions for you.   I look forward to hopefully speaking with
  you soon.</p>

<p>Mainly Scam. I would ignore this.</p>

<p>Investors are trying to maximize their profits. In general they do this by a good selection instead of a huge portfolio (too many different startups)</p>

<p>On the other side there are (too?) many events and opportunities to present your startup/company in front of investors. So in general investors do not have to do "cold prospecting/cold calling" or even mass mailings. </p>

<p>Lets assume I'm wrong with this hypothesis.</p>

<p>Investor&lt;>company relationships are based on trust, contracts, direct interaction and transparency. In the best case you become friends and partners. Because you increase the value of the company and the investor likes your idea and progress.</p>

<p>In this case a complete stranger found your company. And fell in love with your idea, progress and team. He will contact you again. On a better way, with better arguments. (In my opinion this could happen, but not with this email guy :-) )</p>

<p>tl;dr; It's scam. a real investor would use proper ways to get in contact. I get these mails multiple times a week...</p>
