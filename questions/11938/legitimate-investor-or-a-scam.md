I have received numerous emails over the past several years from various investors interested in purchasing my company.  It's obvious they are trolling for deals, but I am wondering if anyone in this site has seen similar types of inquiries and if these are some sort of a scam?

Here is a typical email I receive.  They all have a similar theme...

 1. Seeking software companies with revenues $>1M (typically >5M)
 2. Author of the letter claims he will move to our location and step in to run the business.

> I hope this email finds you well. I'm a Chicago-based investor looking

> as a potential opportunity.

Mainly Scam. I would ignore this.

Investors are trying to maximize their profits. In general they do this by a good selection instead of a huge portfolio (too many different startups)

On the other side there are (too?) many events and opportunities to present your startup/company in front of investors. So in general investors do not have to do "cold prospecting/cold calling" or even mass mailings. 

Lets assume I'm wrong with this hypothesis.

Investor<>company relationships are based on trust, contracts, direct interaction and transparency. In the best case you become friends and partners. Because you increase the value of the company and the investor likes your idea and progress.

In this case a complete stranger found your company. And fell in love with your idea, progress and team. He will contact you again. On a better way, with better arguments. (In my opinion this could happen, but not with this email guy :-) )

tl;dr; It's scam. a real investor would use proper ways to get in contact. I get these mails multiple times a week...
