I am working on a comprehensive campaign for the launch of our official Version 1 of a software application we are building for an international market.
Some of the items include adwords, social media, press releases etc.

What are the key things I should be sharing about the product to get interest that eventually leads to download and usage?

We are going really broad to reach as many people as possible. Should I just be picking the top 2 or 3 benefits and punting those?

Any input here would be great.

There's no one size fits all answer.

A cheap, simple product driven by emotional buys might need a short landing page with two or three key benefits raised.

At the other end of the spectrum, a very expensive, very complex product might need tons of sales copy to sell at all -- the site itself, case studies, white papers, newsletters, ecourses, guest blogs, and what have you.

What the two always have in common is you shouldn't be pulling sales arguments out of thin air. Interview a few happy clients to get the sales arguments straight from the horse's mouth.

While writing your sales copy:

- Clients buy benefits, solutions, and answers. Not features, credentials, or slogans. (The latter help but aren't key.)
- Mind your headlines. They make the difference between your sales copy being read or not.
- the goal of the first setence is to get the user to read the second one. And so forth until the end of the sales document.
- Raise common sales objections if any -- e.g. include a FAQ.
- Don't forget a call to action.

Complete aside: don't miss producthunt.com if the productis moreor less final. And [crowd funding](https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/4098/types-of-incentives-for-powerful-crowdfunding/4104#4104) if it still needs a bit of work.
