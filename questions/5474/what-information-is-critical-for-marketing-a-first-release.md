<p>I am working on a comprehensive campaign for the launch of our official Version 1 of a software application we are building for an international market.
Some of the items include adwords, social media, press releases etc.</p>

<p>What are the key things I should be sharing about the product to get interest that eventually leads to download and usage?</p>

<p>We are going really broad to reach as many people as possible. Should I just be picking the top 2 or 3 benefits and punting those?</p>

<p>Any input here would be great.</p>

<p>There's no one size fits all answer.</p>

<p>A cheap, simple product driven by emotional buys might need a short landing page with two or three key benefits raised.</p>

<p>At the other end of the spectrum, a very expensive, very complex product might need tons of sales copy to sell at all -- the site itself, case studies, white papers, newsletters, ecourses, guest blogs, and what have you.</p>

<p>What the two always have in common is you shouldn't be pulling sales arguments out of thin air. Interview a few happy clients to get the sales arguments straight from the horse's mouth.</p>

<p>While writing your sales copy:</p>

<ul>
<li>Clients buy benefits, solutions, and answers. Not features, credentials, or slogans. (The latter help but aren't key.)</li>
<li>Mind your headlines. They make the difference between your sales copy being read or not.</li>
<li>the goal of the first setence is to get the user to read the second one. And so forth until the end of the sales document.</li>
<li>Raise common sales objections if any -- e.g. include a FAQ.</li>
<li>Don't forget a call to action.</li>
</ul>

<p>Complete aside: don't miss producthunt.com if the productis moreor less final. And <a href="https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/4098/types-of-incentives-for-powerful-crowdfunding/4104#4104">crowd funding</a> if it still needs a bit of work.</p>
