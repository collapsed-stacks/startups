<p>I have one application developed in Spring Framework and this application deals with large amount of data.So it would be better if I will give a dedicated application or separate instance to each customer.</p>

<p>I want to give them a separate URL for their organisation e.g. 
If company abc is there, then may be I can give them something like <a href="http://www.abc.appname.com...and" rel="nofollow">http://www.abc.appname.com...and</a> it will like dedicated to that client. </p>

<p>How can I do it? What are the different ways to achieve it so that each client can have its own server load etc.</p>
