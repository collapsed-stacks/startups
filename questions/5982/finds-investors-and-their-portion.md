<p>It sounds like you are going to have a passive investor fund your idea? In that case, you will need to work out the terms directly with the investor. Sounds like they will either be an early stage angel investor or a co-founder. In either case, <a href="http://www.foundrs.com" rel="nofollow">here is a really helpful tool</a> to help you approach the decision of the equity split.</p>

<p>As far as where to find them? There are generally four sources. In order of timing (earliest first) they are as follows.</p>

<ol>
<li>The entrepreneur himself.</li>
<li>Friends, family and associates of the entrepreneur.</li>
<li>Angel investors.</li>
<li>Venture capitalists.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are online communities and local clubs/organizations in major metro areas for Angels, VCs and entrepreneurs to meet.</p>
