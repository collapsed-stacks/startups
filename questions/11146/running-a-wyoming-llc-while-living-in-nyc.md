I have a WY LLC and will start running it as an online business. This LLC has no physical presence in NY, and even inventory and registered offices are outside NY. However, I live in NY.

In this case, would anyone know if I am required to register this LLC in NY? Many thanks for any insight given.

Yes, you are required to [register in New York](http://www.dos.ny.gov/corps/buscorp.html#appauth) and to pay New York income taxes. You must also [collect New York sales tax](https://www.tax.ny.gov/bus/st/register.htm).

Be careful because the New York Dept of Tax and Finance is well-funded and extremely aggressive relative to other states. Their investigators are known to travel outside of NY and to surveil suspects.

If you want to avoid New York taxes while remaining a resident of New York, you would have to set up an office in a more-friendly neighboring state (though probably not New Jersey), and commute to that office whenever you want to work for the business.
