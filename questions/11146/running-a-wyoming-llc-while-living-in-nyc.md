<p>I have a WY LLC and will start running it as an online business. This LLC has no physical presence in NY, and even inventory and registered offices are outside NY. However, I live in NY.</p>

<p>In this case, would anyone know if I am required to register this LLC in NY? Many thanks for any insight given.</p>

<p>Yes, you are required to <a href="http://www.dos.ny.gov/corps/buscorp.html#appauth" rel="nofollow">register in New York</a> and to pay New York income taxes. You must also <a href="https://www.tax.ny.gov/bus/st/register.htm" rel="nofollow">collect New York sales tax</a>.</p>

<p>Be careful because the New York Dept of Tax and Finance is well-funded and extremely aggressive relative to other states. Their investigators are known to travel outside of NY and to surveil suspects.</p>

<p>If you want to avoid New York taxes while remaining a resident of New York, you would have to set up an office in a more-friendly neighboring state (though probably not New Jersey), and commute to that office whenever you want to work for the business.</p>
