Is there something like waiting list for ideas of software startups where people could vote for them. In this way, ideas are validated by future customers.

**UPD:**
I am interested in ProductHunt-like platform. Kickstarter and Indiegogo require lots of preparation and very detailed project description where you already know how you will implement it.

<p>If anything has value, there is a marketplace for it, right?</p>

<p>In his article "<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/ideas.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Ideas for Startups</a>", Paul Graham gives a theory for why there is no "idea" marketplace. He has a very good explanation: perhaps ideas have little value if any.</p>

<p>One of the problemas with ideas is that it is very hard to judge a good idea using common sense. I, for one, would pass on AirBNB: what a dumb idea, renting your house to a complete stranger or staying at some random stranger's home, who would do that?</p>

<p>Another problem is that few people are short of ideas. In fact, I think the problem of having too many ideas is much more common.</p>

<p>Ideas are not very important, execution is. That is why the crowdfunding websites listed in the other answer are not selling ideas: they are selling the promise of execution.</p>
