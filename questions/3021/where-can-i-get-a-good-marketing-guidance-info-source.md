<p>I'm working in the marketing department of a 10 year old company that has me in constant interaction with their customers.</p>

<p>I often reach situations where I just don't know what to do.</p>

<p>What is a good site or forum that I can use like stackexchange that is solely for marketing? </p>

<p>So far I've tried Stackexchange of course, Quora, and a forum I found online called FreshMarketingForum</p>

<p>I need a solid source of marketing knowledge, do you guys know any?</p>
