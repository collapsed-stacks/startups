I'm working in the marketing department of a 10 year old company that has me in constant interaction with their customers.

I often reach situations where I just don't know what to do.

What is a good site or forum that I can use like stackexchange that is solely for marketing? 

So far I've tried Stackexchange of course, Quora, and a forum I found online called FreshMarketingForum

I need a solid source of marketing knowledge, do you guys know any?
