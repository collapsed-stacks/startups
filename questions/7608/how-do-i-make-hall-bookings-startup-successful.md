I see that people in my city book halls for marriages. I want to start an online website where people could see prices of halls for different days and see when is a certain hall free and when not and be able to book a hall on a certain day. How do I make this process automated? Thanks.

This actually is a really good idea. Nevertheless, you should validate it. First talk to the owners of marriage hall and ask what their problems are. Then think of how you would go about solving them through technology. Do the same for people who are looking to get married or have recently gotten married. Ask them what problem they're facing / faced. Then think of how you would go about solving their problem.

Do not assume that building a website for booking marriage halls would automatically be successful. A business has to solve a problem and your job is to find that problem and solve that problem through the use of technology.

Combine both of these solutions on a nice website and you've got yourself a great startup.

As for the process of making it automated, it's actually really simple. Get hall owners on board. Give them a place (perhaps an app) where they can enter dates when their hall is free. The onus of updating the dates will be on them. Display these dates on your website along with the pictures and prices of the venue etc. People book and you notify the owner that their hall is booked for a certain date. Viola, you've gotten yourself a pretty automated system.
