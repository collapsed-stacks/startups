Looking for suggestions on how to find new startups. I have tried looking at a number of sources, for example, [AngelList][1] - but there's a massive amount of orgs listed that are really do not appear to be startups; meaning that many just appear to be new businesses.

What is the best single source for finding real new startups?

<p>You can check out other websites, alternatives to AngelList, that also cover the news from startup world - such as <a href="http://superbcrew.com/">SuperbCrew</a> (focuses on interviews with founders, CEOs or team-members of new startups or startups that will launch soon, but there are also news, founder stories, reviews etc...) or <a href="http://www.new-startups.com/">NewStartups</a> - something similar as the previous website, maybe with little less focus on interviews than SuperbCrew.</p>

<p>I think <a href="http://betalist.com">BetaList</a>, <a href="http://crunchbase.com/">CrunchBase</a>, <a href="http://mashable.com/category/startups/">Mashable Startups</a>, <a href="http://startups.co.uk/">Startups.co.uk</a> might also be interesting to you. BetaList and CrunchBase are more like AngelList, and Mashable Startups and Techcrunch mostly cover news and reviews of startups. Startups.co.uk is also worth visiting, they have a good know-how section, and a lot of useful stuff for beginner entrepreneurs.</p>

<p>You can find a nice database of Startups on <strong>the <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/">CrunchBase</a></strong> that is a part of the well known <a href="http://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</a> magazine.</p>

<p>The big advantage is that it not only contains the list of startups but it also contains information about the founders, the employees, the investments and the "news" for each company. It is definitely a good start point for everybody looking to discover the wold of Startups.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.producthunt.com/" rel="nofollow">Product Hunt</a> is the best site that I have found for discovering new startups. I've found that the crowdsourcing works better than any of the startup blogs. I've discovered about 75-80 new interesting startups through Product Hunt so far.</p>

<p>This might seem obvious, but <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/" rel="nofollow">Kickstarter</a>, <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/" rel="nofollow">Indiegogo</a> etc. could be an answer.
I know they are focused on crowdfunding, but some of the listed projects/startups don't get their capital.</p>

<p>Try <a href="https://startupdigger.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Startup Digger</a>. It aggregates new products from various resources such as PH, Betalist, Hacker News and so on.</p>
