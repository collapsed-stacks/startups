<p>I wanted to know the best method to licensing an product. Should i complete it on my own. I'm new to this "Kind of" and understand how it works and the process and steps i should take. But i am being told i should go to a broker. What. Is the advantages to having a broker? I heard some companies only work through brokers is this true?</p>

<p>Personally i won't mind doing it myself as a broker can get pretty expensive upfront.</p>

<p>Even with your further explanations, your question is still unclear, but I'll make some assumptions.</p>

<p>I assume this is a patent license because I can't think of any other type of license that is relevant to an auto part.  I also assume that you are seeking to get a license from someone else (as opposed to giving someone else a license).</p>

<p>If that is the case, then the person granting the license will draft the license agreement so you don't need someone to do that for you.</p>

<p>You will need someone to help you review the license and perhaps negotiate some of the terms.  I've never heard of a "license broker," but in the U.S., at least, it is illegal for a non-attorney to practice law, so you need an attorney to help you.</p>

<p>Patent licenses are very complicated so doing it yourself is a very bad idea.</p>
