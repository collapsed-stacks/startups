<p>I want to pitch a software idea to a prospective team member. Before that, I want to send an NDA to be signed. They mentioned my "template" is "too vague and does not clearly delineate our respective rights and responsibilities."</p>

<p>That being said, from the templates/suggestions I've found, I am to include these 12 basic items. For each item, I've summarized the verbiage of the agreement. </p>

<p>Questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Which of these items can be altered/removed? If altered, how should I alter to be less vague and clearly protect both parties?</p></li>
<li><p>Which items should be added?</p></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<ol>
<li>Confidential Information.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>States my intent to disclose my confidential info of idea x to
  recipient, then describes what "info" entails: materials, business
  plans, marketing, etc...</p>
</blockquote>

<ol start="2">
<li>Recipientsâ€™ Obligations.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>States a) that recipient agrees to said info is confidential, and
  shouldn't disclose it without written consent or specific need to
  know. And b) the info disclosed by Me in tangible form to recipient
  honor the same standards</p>
</blockquote>

<ol start="3">
<li>Term.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>Obligations of recipient shall be effect for 3 years and shall not be
  affected by bankruptcy, receivership, assignment, etc...</p>
</blockquote>

<ol start="4">
<li>No License.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>States that nothing contained within agreement shall be construed as
  granting rights by license to the confidential info, and describes the
  info may pertain to prospective or unannounced products. Recipient
  agrees to not use info as basis to develop competing/similar product.</p>
</blockquote>

<ol start="5">
<li>No Publicity.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>Basically, Recipient will not disclose their participation in project or
  anything related</p>
</blockquote>

<ol start="6">
<li>Governing Law and Equitable Relief.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>Agreement will be governed in accordance with my state's law and USA
  and consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of state courts and US fed
  courts for any dispute... and talks about in case of breach of
  contract... owner may obtain legal remedies</p>
</blockquote>

<ol start="7">
<li>Final Agreement.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>This agreement terminates/supersedes all prior understandings of
  subject matter... this agreement can only be modified by further
  writing duly accepted by both parties</p>
</blockquote>

<ol start="8">
<li>No Assignment.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>Recipient cannot assign this agreement to anyone else without my
  permission</p>
</blockquote>

<ol start="9">
<li>Severability.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>Basically states... that if any part of my agreement is unenforceable,
  all other aspects of agreement will remain in full force as though
  that unenforceable item was never included</p>
</blockquote>

<ol start="10">
<li>Notices.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>Talks about how this contract should be in writing/signed</p>
</blockquote>

<ol start="11">
<li>No Implied Waiver.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm giving the template's verbiage verbatim because I don't really understand it: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Either party's failure to insist in any one or more instances upon
  strict performance by the other party of any of the terms of this
  Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any continuing or
  subsequent failure to perform or delay in performance of any term
  hereof."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think this means:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If I don't bitch about something one time doesn't give them the right
  to continue to breach the contract?</p>
</blockquote>

<ol start="12">
<li>Headings.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>The article's headings shouldn't imply any intent and are only there
  for convenience/organization</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then space for signatures of both parties</p>

<p>Most people do not have the time or the resources to examine every NDA under the sun and I have never seen an NDA that was not vague.</p>

<ul>
<li>If you do not trust the person you are dealing with, then do not deal with them.</li>
<li>If the party does not agree to your requests, then find someone else to work with. </li>
<li>If no one agrees to your terms, it is likely not your terms that are the issue, but that people do not trust you.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm not a lawyer, and this doesn't constitute legal advice. But I have signed a lot of NDAs in the past.</p>

<p>What you have outlined there seems reasonable, and it's all template/boiler-plate stuff, which is fine.</p>

<p>There are some areas I would suggest you are very specific, which you haven't mentioned:</p>

<ul>
<li>Identify the parties signing the NDA, clearly using any legal entity
names in full (Widgets Inc. of 123 Westdrive, Westtown, CA...).</li>
<li>Be clear whether this is a one-way (you to them) or two-way (covers
both parties sharing info) agreement.</li>
<li>Be very clear about the purpose of the exchange of information, to
tighten up the scope. For example, "Sharing technology, market
research, pricing and go-to-market strategy for a the proposed
product XYZ".</li>
</ul>

<p>The last point, in particular, should tighten things up giving you more protection but also ensuring the NDA isn't overly broad and restrictive.</p>
