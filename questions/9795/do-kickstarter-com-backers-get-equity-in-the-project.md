<p>I have not found anywhere that Kickstarter backers get any equity or percentage of profit or anything.  Is this true?</p>

<p>Backers get nothing beyond the deliverable and the perks they paid into. (Or at least, not unless those who behind the crowdfunding feel <em>very</em> generous - if they're even <em>allowed</em> to.)</p>

<p>There even was something of a controversy about this very topic recently:</p>
