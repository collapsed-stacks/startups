I have not found anywhere that Kickstarter backers get any equity or percentage of profit or anything.  Is this true?

Backers get nothing beyond the deliverable and the perks they paid into. (Or at least, not unless those who behind the crowdfunding feel _very_ generous - if they're even _allowed_ to.)

There even was something of a controversy about this very topic recently:
