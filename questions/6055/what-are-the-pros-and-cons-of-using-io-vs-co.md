<p>I'm thinking of buying a domain name for my technology startup. I want to buy a .io or a .co domain name. What are the pros and cons of each? .co seems to be cheaper with most registars, but .io seems more common. </p>

<p>Just assume: there isn't any way that I can get  the .com and no, I'm not going to do a variation on the name or change it just so I can get the .com.</p>

<p>Go with the .io, for a couple reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>".co" and ".com" are really easy to confuse for the average user. Guess which one is more likely to get the traffic?</li>
<li>An ".io" ending will be easier to distinguish than a ".co" ending if you can't have the ".com" TLD, if only for the reason specified in point #1.</li>
</ol>

<p>I would stay away from both especially the <code>.co</code></p>

<p>It is almost guaranteed that if you have a successful <code>.co</code> or even <code>.io</code> the current <code>.com</code> owner is going to put the site up just to profit from the confusion.</p>

<p>You can find some meaningless <code>.com</code> or perhaps you can go with one of the generic domains such as: <code>.club .photo .center</code> or something along those lines if that would fit your business category.</p>

<p>Remember, <code>.com</code> is THE KING so your priority should be finding suitable <code>.com</code> domain.</p>

<p>Go for .com, use suffix, .io became synonymous of fail start-ups, now is the preferred cc of tech geek squatters, most of them got off the hook on time dumping their .io's in the market for a fair price,.. It's being blocked by a lot of it servers due to spam, and just recently the British gov. Cracked down a red of child pornography that involved over 1400 pages of child pornography, lots of casinos, it's sketchy...</p>
