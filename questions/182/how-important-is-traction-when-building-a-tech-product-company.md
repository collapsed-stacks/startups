<p>When creating a tech company, customer's usage of the product(s)/service(s) and their feedback sometimes can be difficult to gather. How important is traction when building a tech product/company? Is it the main thing an investor may look for?</p>

<p>Your question, first off, is a bit ambiguous, but I think you are trying to weigh the importance of gathering data on your users against other valuable metrics.</p>

<p>As I've had much experience with investors and closing deals (and signing contracts!), the number one thing an investor focuses on is the team. Every single factor of business success can always be extracted and put into perspective by looking at the team.</p>

<p>That said, the traction of your team is similar to the traction of a vehicle. No matter how good the engine, the brakes, the model -- if you don't have any traction, your car won't go anywhere.</p>

<p>I think traction is a necessary component, like many other components, needed to successfully drive the business from point A to point B. Your metrics and user statistics are what you hold on to for dear life - there's a reason it's called traction.</p>
