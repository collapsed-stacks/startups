<p>After reading through <a href="http://www.ap.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ap.org/</a>, Reuters, BBC guidelines, etc the only part I understand is News Pictures or videos have a good chance of being paid. News headlines could be paid as well. <br />
One must seek permission before using content. The alternative to the permission seeking is request a quote, most likely pay a subscription fee and get all the latest updates through their respective news suites.</p>

<p>This is where my question comes in, If one reads an article on e.g. AP and Reuters and creates a completely unique article keeping all the info in the article as-is, could the newly created article be sourced or Credited as AP &amp; Reuters or no source mentioned at all?</p>

<p>Would that be legal?<br /> 
Would that adhere to basic journalism Ethics/Guidelines/Principles.</p>

<p>Each news provider will have their own terms and conditions. </p>

<p>Think of the fury many news providers have gone thru fighting Google News who they say make profits without sharing. Some countries have found work-rounds - for example Spain is (or was) to charge Google a yearly fee that would be distributed to various news writers. France had another solution (I cannot recall exactly).</p>

<p>Thus... It is highly unlikely that AP, Reuters, BBC will pay their staff to write news content so that you or others can take the text, the profits, the credit without sharing the last two with them.</p>

<p>A possibility might exist where you provide their page unaltered (including their adverts) in addition to your own paid for adverts - but this would be a clause in their T&amp;C.</p>
