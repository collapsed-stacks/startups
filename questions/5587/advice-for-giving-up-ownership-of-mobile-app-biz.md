I developed an iOS app which is currently for sale on the App Store. I've made a little bit of money on it but it needs updates and in app purchases developed before publishing reviews in trade magazines would be worth it. I freelance in film production (the app is for film pros). I don't feel like writing code or running a business anymore but I think the app has potential and I don't want to let it die. Does anyone have any advice on this? One thought I had was trying to find someone to give majority ownership to and consulting for them. Is there anything I should know before transferring ownership?

It depends on what it's worth to you, figure time, money and effort plus idea and you're still at zero unless you show value (revenue:cold hard cash baby). Your value can be pitched by sales #'s, etc. Talk to brokers and if you're not good in sales, if it's worth it to you again, hire someone who will get you what u deserve from it
