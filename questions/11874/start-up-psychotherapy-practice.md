<p>Me and my colleague are planning on starting a counseling practice.  However, we are confused about the best legal structure to use to minimize risk and support our launch.  We would like to use one name and one website, but she has been told by her accountant that we should not have a joint business because it is too complicated.  Could one of us have the LLC and somehow, without being an "employee", the other one actually work under the practice, or be named on the website?  How would we handle finances, i.e. could I, if I were the owner, bill under the LLC, and then she just bill under her own name?  Or, is there a way for us to share a name and website, but not be legally bound?  We bought a domain name and have started working on the website, but it seems like there are some legal hurdles.  It is unclear to us whether we absolutely have to meet with an attorney, and if so, for what purpose.  Any and all guidance would be quite helpful!</p>
