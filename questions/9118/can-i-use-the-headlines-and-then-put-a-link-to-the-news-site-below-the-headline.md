<blockquote>

<p>It depends on the legal policies and the <code>terms and conditions</code> of the respective websites.</p>

<p>Specifically speaking, they would be happy to have a reference link to their site from a third party, which'd help boost their traffic and also their search ranking (depending on the traffic inflow which you can provide).</p>

<p>However, you might again want to be absolutely sure about the legal policies of all those sites before you build the aggregator.</p>

<p>If you put the source name in the link and each time put a link to the source, yes there is no problems.</p>

<p><strong>BUT you have to the source allow you to embed content from its site</strong></p>

<p>Yes, this question is best raised in the legal exchange (and I am not a lawyer) but keep in mind answers will vary across juristiction/state/country.</p>

<p>Google News works roughly speaking like you describe (headline, sometimes first paragraph of story, and a link) and some publishers have fought it. In Spain, the country created a fund for the likes of Google to pay into because its recognised that Google profit from the news service. France found a similar (but different method which I cannot recall in detail).</p>

<p>In other areas/regions the "fair use" would win the order of the day, so long as you are not claiming/implying that you have any special relationship with the source of any articles you are linking to.</p>

<p>Some publishers might take offense if you used stories to lead the reader on a predominantly one sided view, and were implying that the source of the stories had arrived at the same conclusion (because you might decide to exclude stories from the same publishers that could imply something you don't support). Think race, politics, religion for example. Think Trump, Gun Ownership, Islamaphobia, Holocaust, Genocide. Some could selectively report articles to build support for extremism and some publishers would not feel comfort in such company.</p>

<p>Two points you need consider. If you crawl for stories then your crawler should be familiar with a webservers robots.txt file (<a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6062608?hl=en" rel="nofollow">https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6062608?hl=en</a>) and you should also be familiar with the terms and condtions of your source.  Just because a site has T&amp;C does not imply they are legal - but you should familiarise yourself with them. Some conditions within T&amp;C could be considered unenforcible by a court if deemed overly harsh or intrusive.</p>
