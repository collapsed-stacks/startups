## Why do many startups register very similar domain names to existing businesses?

The `.co` and `.ly` TLDs became popular because they allowed registering domain names for which `.com` was taken. Other startups insert "get", "try", "on" or other prefix in order to get the .com.

This practice is obviously quite widespread, despite the [advice to avoid it](https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/1283/domain-with-the-name-myproduct-com-already-taken), and [existing risks](https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/5303/risks-to-purchase-domain-before-its-tm-registration-under-existing-similar-mark). What are its legal ramifications under US trademark/copyright law? Does it matter if the preexisting company operates in the same industry?

Why do so many startups do this? Are the risks exaggerated?

I believe you will want to refer to the Anti-Cybersquatting Piracy Act (ACPA) of 1999 for current legislation **[[LINK](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CRPT-106srpt140/html/CRPT-106srpt140.htm)]**. It is an addendum to the Lantham Act S.43(d) 15 U.S.C S.1125(d).

It seems to put into law the basic premises to equip plaintiffs with a matter of recourse to "bad faith" dealings involving domain names.
