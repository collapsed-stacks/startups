## Why do many startups register very similar domain names to existing businesses?

<p>The <code>.co</code> and <code>.ly</code> TLDs became popular because they allowed registering domain names for which <code>.com</code> was taken. Other startups insert "get", "try", "on" or other prefix in order to get the .com.</p>

<p>This practice is obviously quite widespread, despite the <a href="https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/1283/domain-with-the-name-myproduct-com-already-taken">advice to avoid it</a>, and <a href="https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/5303/risks-to-purchase-domain-before-its-tm-registration-under-existing-similar-mark">existing risks</a>. What are its legal ramifications under US trademark/copyright law? Does it matter if the preexisting company operates in the same industry?</p>

<p>Why do so many startups do this? Are the risks exaggerated?</p>

<p>I believe you will want to refer to the Anti-Cybersquatting Piracy Act (ACPA) of 1999 for current legislation <strong>[<a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CRPT-106srpt140/html/CRPT-106srpt140.htm" rel="nofollow">LINK</a>]</strong>. It is an addendum to the Lantham Act S.43(d) 15 U.S.C S.1125(d).</p>

<p>It seems to put into law the basic premises to equip plaintiffs with a matter of recourse to "bad faith" dealings involving domain names.</p>
