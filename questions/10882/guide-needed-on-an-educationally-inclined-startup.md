<p>Read the details of this next generation sensation startup. It is aimed at helping students pass their exams (the ones taken in my country) like Prepscholar. I want to have a website to that effect and an exquisite and featured app.</p>

<p>I want the website to allow the following</p>

<ul>
<li>the students to login and take video lectures, </li>
<li>a Q and A section like Quora or Stack Exchange. </li>
<li>a class-simulation like CodeAcademy, Lynda.com or Coursera. </li>
<li>to be able to sell college help stuff (e-books and stationery)</li>
<li>the users to have badges just like Stackexchange. </li>
<li>the best functionality. </li>
</ul>

<p>How  do I achieve this without breaking the bank?</p>

<p>What do I need to know to go into this business (programming languages, technical know-how word on marble, managerial and business advice). How do I increase my business (to prepscholar standards) leaving it fully automated while studying at college?</p>

<p>This is a long question. I dont mind reading an e-book (if it warrants that!) Thanks for your anticipated response.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately what you describe will require <strong>a lot more</strong> than reading an ebook. Or quite a bit of money to pay people who know how to do all these things.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>video lectures</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Producing high-quality video requires expertise in set design, film-making, audio engineering, video editing, and of course, content.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Q and A section like Quora or Stack Exchange</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An interactive website needs to be written in a server-side programming language. Stack Exchange was written in C#. Quora was written in Python. Other options are PHP, Perl, Ruby, Java, Node.js, and anything else that runs on a server.</p>

<p>You will also need client-side interactivity for which you will need JavaScript and probably an appropriate framework.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>i want to be able to sell college help stuffs(e-books and stationeries)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>E-commerce requires additional sets of expertise that generally mirror what you need to know to run a successful brick-and-mortar retail store. You need marketing, accounting, logistics, etc. Each of these is something in which someone can get a college degree.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>how do i achieve this without breaking the bank.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dedicate at least 10 years of your (full-time) life to learning everything necessary. Or get a good source of financing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>how do i increase my business leaving it fully automated while studying at college?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can hire people to run it for you. A business this complex won't run itself.</p>

<hr>

<p>You might be better off focusing on one <strong>small</strong> thing. Read up on the idea of a <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-minimum-viable-product" rel="nofollow">Minimal Viable Product</a> and see if you can focus on just that to start.</p>
