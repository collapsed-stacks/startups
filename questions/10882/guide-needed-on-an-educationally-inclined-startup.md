Read the details of this next generation sensation startup. It is aimed at helping students pass their exams (the ones taken in my country) like Prepscholar. I want to have a website to that effect and an exquisite and featured app.

I want the website to allow the following

 - the students to login and take video lectures, 
 - a Q and A section like Quora or Stack Exchange. 
 - a class-simulation like CodeAcademy, Lynda.com or Coursera. 
 - to be able to sell college help stuff (e-books and stationery)
 - the users to have badges just like Stackexchange. 
 - the best functionality. 

How  do I achieve this without breaking the bank?

What do I need to know to go into this business (programming languages, technical know-how word on marble, managerial and business advice). How do I increase my business (to prepscholar standards) leaving it fully automated while studying at college?

This is a long question. I dont mind reading an e-book (if it warrants that!) Thanks for your anticipated response.

>  i dont mind reading an e-book(if it warrants that!)

Unfortunately what you describe will require **a lot more** than reading an ebook. Or quite a bit of money to pay people who know how to do all these things.

> video lectures

Producing high-quality video requires expertise in set design, film-making, audio engineering, video editing, and of course, content.

> Q and A section like Quora or Stack Exchange

An interactive website needs to be written in a server-side programming language. Stack Exchange was written in C#. Quora was written in Python. Other options are PHP, Perl, Ruby, Java, Node.js, and anything else that runs on a server.

You will also need client-side interactivity for which you will need JavaScript and probably an appropriate framework.

> i want to be able to sell college help stuffs(e-books and stationeries)

E-commerce requires additional sets of expertise that generally mirror what you need to know to run a successful brick-and-mortar retail store. You need marketing, accounting, logistics, etc. Each of these is something in which someone can get a college degree.

> how do i achieve this without breaking the bank.

Dedicate at least 10 years of your (full-time) life to learning everything necessary. Or get a good source of financing.

> how do i increase my business leaving it fully automated while studying at college?

You can hire people to run it for you. A business this complex won't run itself.

You might be better off focusing on one **small** thing. Read up on the idea of a [Minimal Viable Product](https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-minimum-viable-product) and see if you can focus on just that to start.
