Are there any templates that startups can use for Venture capital presentations? I am looking into presenting my Software to VCs, I want my presentation to be in line with today's startups.

For a very good structure and template to present to VCs have a look at Dave McClure's [How to Pitch a VC (or Angel)](http://theupstart.co/2761/dave-mcclure-how-to-pitch-a-vc-or-angel-investor/). He suggests the following 10 sections -

>1. Elevator Pitch
>2. The Problem
>3. Your Solution
>4. Market Size
>5. Business Model
>6. Proprietary Tech
>7. Competition
>8. Marketing Plan
>9. Team/Hires
>10. Money/Milestones

In addition, I found the following [link](http://nextviewventures.com/blog/free-startup-pitch-decks-template/) which contains two kinds of templates. One which follows a more conversation style (for private pitches of 1on1 meeting) and another which is a more show style (for demo days or large audience).
