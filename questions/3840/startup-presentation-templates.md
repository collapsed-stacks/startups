<p>Are there any templates that startups can use for Venture capital presentations? I am looking into presenting my Software to VCs, I want my presentation to be in line with today's startups.</p>

<p>For a very good structure and template to present to VCs have a look at Dave McClure's <a href="http://theupstart.co/2761/dave-mcclure-how-to-pitch-a-vc-or-angel-investor/" rel="nofollow">How to Pitch a VC (or Angel)</a>. He suggests the following 10 sections -</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>Elevator Pitch</li>
  <li>The Problem</li>
  <li>Your Solution</li>
  <li>Market Size</li>
  <li>Business Model</li>
  <li>Proprietary Tech</li>
  <li>Competition</li>
  <li>Marketing Plan</li>
  <li>Team/Hires</li>
  <li>Money/Milestones</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>In addition, I found the following <a href="http://nextviewventures.com/blog/free-startup-pitch-decks-template/" rel="nofollow">link</a> which contains two kinds of templates. One which follows a more conversation style (for private pitches of 1on1 meeting) and another which is a more show style (for demo days or large audience).</p>
