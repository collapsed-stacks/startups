<p>What is actually startup? Is it just building a company or more than that? If those are startups how companies like Google lost the startup tag? Is it just a intuitive idea on which a startup is based? </p>

<p>There is no extract definition for what is startup.</p>

<p>According to Wikipedia,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A startup company (startup or start-up) is an entrepreneurial venture
  which is typically a newly emerged, fast-growing business that aims to
  meet a marketplace need by developing or offering an innovative
  product, process or service. A startup is usually a company such as a
  small business, a partnership or an organization designed to rapidly
  develop scalable business model.[1] Startup companies often deploy
  technologies such as Internet, e-commerce, computers,
  telecommunications, or robotics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to Neil Blumenthal, co-founder and CEO of Warby Parker,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A startup is a company working to solve a problem where the solution
  is not obvious and success is not guaranteed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to Investopedia,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A startup is a young company that is just beginning to develop.
  Startups are usually small and initially financed and operated by a
  handful of founders or one individual. These companies offer a product
  or service that is not currently being offered elsewhere in the
  market, or that the founders believe is being offered in an inferior
  manner.</p>
