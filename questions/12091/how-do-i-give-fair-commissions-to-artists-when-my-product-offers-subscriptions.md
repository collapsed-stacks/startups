<p>I apologize if this the wrong place for this question in advance!</p>

<p>I run a site that has around 2000 video-based lessons, taught by some 50 instructors. For most of the life of the site (9 yrs) these lessons were only offered as direct purchases. </p>

<p>Now however, I'm implementing subscriptions (to all lessons), and I'm really struggling to find a fair way to assign commissions to the instructors. Surely this is a well known topic in business, but I'm a software engineer and don't know much about these things.</p>

<p>Is there a place/book I can go to learn about my options?</p>

<p>What about this?:</p>

<ul>
<li>Determining the total monthly revenue from subscribers.</li>
<li>Counting the total number of lessons watched by subscribers.</li>
<li>For each instructor, determining the percentage of the monthly lesson views attributed to them.</li>
<li>Giving them that percentage of revenue (minus your fees or overhead, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>If lessons are of greatly different lengths, you may want to count minutes watched instead of just lesson views.</p>
