I apologize if this the wrong place for this question in advance!

I run a site that has around 2000 video-based lessons, taught by some 50 instructors. For most of the life of the site (9 yrs) these lessons were only offered as direct purchases. 

Now however, I'm implementing subscriptions (to all lessons), and I'm really struggling to find a fair way to assign commissions to the instructors. Surely this is a well known topic in business, but I'm a software engineer and don't know much about these things.

Is there a place/book I can go to learn about my options?

What about this?:

 - Determining the total monthly revenue from subscribers.
 - Counting the total number of lessons watched by subscribers.
 - For each instructor, determining the percentage of the monthly lesson views attributed to them.
 - Giving them that percentage of revenue (minus your fees or overhead, etc.)

If lessons are of greatly different lengths, you may want to count minutes watched instead of just lesson views.
