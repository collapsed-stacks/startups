<p>When looking at the figures of the valuation of the users, I am surprised of the high differences between the valuation of a whatsapp user (roughly 50$) against, say a viber user (roughly 3$, but I am not sure that these valuations took place at the same time).</p>

<p>How come these differences were so high ? These applications seem to gather the same data from the users, after all...</p>

<p>Methinks you're not aware that you're comparing apples to oranges. When it comes to acquisitions, the only thing that counts is how big a check the buyer is willing to write. The rest - call it assets, fundamentals, whatever - is nothing short of cosmetic. It matters, of course, but the key is to understand that the same company can have <em>very</em> different valuations depending on the buyer.</p>

<p>In this case, Rakuten is a conglomerate with over 40 business lines. It's into just about everything online that you can think of: retail, travel agent, bank loans, brokerage, etc. By buying Viber, it's expanding in yet another business. Presumably, it's doing so with the aim of using augmented chat as a commercial platform for its other lines of business.</p>

<p>Facebook, in contrast, paid for a company that could have been part of its downfall:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Chat is an essential part of social media platforms. Particularly on mobile, where chat apps are the ones that get opened most. It's where a lot of future hotness is going to happen. Expect a slew of developments in the coming years on chat-related apps as companies battle to effectively replace SMS. Apple gave a <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2016/06/13/apple-unveils-new-messages-app-features-in-ios-10/" rel="nofollow">taste of what's coming</a> in iOS 10.</p></li>
<li><p>Facebook's user base is <a href="http://qz.com/209542/mark-zuckerberg-is-30-facebooks-users-are-aging-too/" rel="nofollow">starting to age</a>. That's usually not a good sign when you're a social media portal. When you lose the younger audience, you're well on your way to becoming the next MySpace. Plus, it had just <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2013/11/13/snapchat-spurned-3-billion-acquisition-offer-from-facebook/" rel="nofollow">failed to purchase Snapchat</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Put another way, on the one hand side you've a conglomerate that is investing in a new distribution channel for its other business lines, and on the other you've a company that is preemptively buying competitors to remain the relevant social media.</p>

<p>When social networking and messaging startups are being evaluated, the most important factors or variables which comes into place are the monthly active users and also the networking effect.</p>

<p>Now, considering the numbers of both Whatsapp and Viber:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Viber : <strong>754 million registered users</strong> </p>
  
  <p>Whatsapp : <strong>1000 million monthly active users</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Users need to be very active on the product for the company to exploit the networking effect, and whatsapp numbers speaks for itelf.</p>

<p>Networking effect is a very viral and a highly influencing effect in the domain of chat and social networks. So, with such a huge monthly active users numbers, Whatsapp pretty much towers over Viber, whose total registered users number is lesser than Whatsapp's monthly active users stat.</p>

<p>In addition, Whatsapp is now backed by a company which has the lion share of the market in the social networks domain, which is a very influential backing, and also highly boosts the valuation.</p>

<p>The new oil is data. Valuations (and actual sale) of businesses like <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/13/linkedin-bought-by-microsoft-for-262bn-in-cash" rel="nofollow">LinkedIn</a> for $26.2 bn are because of the data that can be gleaned from the members.</p>

<p>Speaking for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/feb/19/facebook-buys-whatsapp-16bn-deal" rel="nofollow">WhatsApp which was sold for $19bn</a> you have a large volume of interesting data ... some suggestions, which I link into Facebook data - which they will.</p>

<p>Viper only has 249 million active users, which gives a much poorer connetivity. But then again valuation is about perception.</p>

<p>Here are a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_virtual_communities_with_more_than_100_million_active_users" rel="nofollow">list of the larger virtual communities</a> suggesting Facebook has 1.65 billion users and WhatsApp has 1 billion active users. There will be a high degree of overlap in these user groups.</p>

<ul>
<li>You know what individuals are connected to each other and the degree of connectivity. The technology used is commonly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database" rel="nofollow">graph databases</a></li>
<li>You can determine a lot about individuals from Facebook - most of which are optional, or can be lied about - place they live, went to school, age, likes, dislikes, political stance, places visited, key family members, key friends, faith/political/social issues.</li>
<li>Additionally the actual messages that are sent/received (both WhatsApp and Facebook) can be understood by a subset of machine learning called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_mining" rel="nofollow">Text Mining</a> that allows sentiment, likes, dislikes, and some understanding of context to be had of messages. So From a string of messages between two people over a year, I can determine birthdays, anniversary, children, patterns of life. Anything that is said in Facebook or WhatsApp can be text mined for inforamtion.</li>
<li>You can also tell who are in followers and who are the influencers in a group of people</li>
<li>Knowing the influencers, and the information you have gleaned from them about their profile, their connections and text mining, you can then understand you to market better to them.</li>
<li>Once you market a product or service to the influencers and succeed in a sale, then they will influence their direct connections into purchasing the same product or service.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Data is the new oil.</strong> <strong>Data is all about understanding your market and selling better.</strong></p>
