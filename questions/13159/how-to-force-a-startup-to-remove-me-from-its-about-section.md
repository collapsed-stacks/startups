I worked with startup that stopped paying me and so after a lot of hand wringing, I stopped working for them.  They still have me listed on their website as an employee even though I do not work for them.

I have asked them to remove me from their site but they haven't, (I first asked in July 2016).

I would rather not spend a lot of money on lawyers for something so trivial but I do not want my name listed on their site.  Is there anyway I can force them to de-list me from the site (based in the UK)?

First off, cool down and stop fretting so much about it. Picture your name getting mentioned in passing, over the course of a conversation they're listening to in the future. Would you rather it conjure up an endless stream of expletive-laden warnings against working with you, or vaguely annoyed indifference that isn't worth mentioning because you've probably changed since?

Second, no one but you cares if you're listed on their website for longer than you should. You can always tell whoever asks that you're no longer part of the company and they haven't updated their website yet. They're simply doing what most companies do. They'll remove you next time they've a good reason to update their about page - for instance when they replace you.

With this in mind, if you still want to make a point of getting your name off of the site, politely ask them again. Then try again. Keep things polite and professional throughout. Then send a last call letter, in which you raise the prospect of having your attorney send the next letter. And if all else fails, have your attorney send a latter.

(If you're based in Europe you might also be able to [ask Google to dereference the page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_be_forgotten).)
