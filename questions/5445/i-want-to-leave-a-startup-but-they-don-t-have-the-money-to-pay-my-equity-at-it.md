## I want to leave a "startup" but they don't have the money to pay my equity at its legal base value. Sell it cheaper, or hold?

<p>I have some equity in a startup that was founded a year ago, because I was working in it as CTO. I now want to leave, and they are interested in me leaving all equity for the small amount I initially paid. The reasons they cite is that having someone that's not working, didn't put a lot of money but have equity is bad in front of an investor. I want to sell the equity at the value the society pact says it has. They say they don't have money to buy it, and that it's fair that I just leave for the small amount.</p>

<p>Do I hold equity unless they buy it at that price? Will they really look bad in front of investors if they state they used that equity to pay an employee?</p>

<p>Thank you very much, for this answer, and for the useful past answer.</p>

<p>Here are the two main risks you take by refusing to sell the stock:</p>

<ul>
<li>The company goes bankrupt and you get zero.</li>
<li>New or existing investors do a hostile dilution to make your position worthless.</li>
</ul>

<p>So don't be too greedy if you're truly convinced they'll fail.</p>

<p>Have you considered making them an offer whereby they pay you in two steps?</p>

<ol>
<li>They pay you whatever you can get away with now, e.g. the amount you initially paid.</li>
<li>They sign you an IOU for the balance, to be paid later, e.g. after receiving their investment, or a year or two down the road.</li>
</ol>

<p>That way if the startup fails you get the money you put in back. And if they succeed you get somewhere between what you'd have earned by working for a salary and the current "fair value". If they're adamant and refuse to pay you the latter, the salary argument might be a good one to put a floor underneath which you won't budge.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Tricky question. If it's a lot of stock and the employee is no longer there or involved, it can reek of "we couldn't work as a team with one of our cofounders". Cofounders splitting up isn't unheard of though. It also introduces the notion that you get away with a chunk of the company without contributing anything -- their incentive to dilute your position will be very high.</p>

<p>Of an IOU, in comparison, you can say "we promised to pay a friend who helped us."</p>
