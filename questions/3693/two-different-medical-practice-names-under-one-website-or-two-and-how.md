<p>I feel that I am in charge of the final choice, kind of like a consultant. I am researching to see the best course of action. </p>

<p>I am creating a website for a doctor. He has a practice that he owns, and Last week he just bought another practice. The practice that he bought is operating under a different name obviously, since it was owned before by another doctor. So I dont think it would be a good idea to change the newly bought practices name since that name is already familiar to patients in that area and customer base. So here is the problem:</p>

<p>Lets call the 1st practice the doctor owns a hypothetical name like “EyeMiami5″.</p>

<p>The second practice that he just bought was hypothetically called “GlassesBrickle”.</p>

<p>Now what should I do (Choices) :</p>

<p>1.) Use EyeMiami5.com as the main website, and have an option for locations on the menu bar which shows “EyeMiami5″, and “GlassesBrickle”.</p>

<p>2.) Rename the actual business “GlassesBrickle” To “EyeMiami5″ and have one website with locations but no possible confusion… Which would make no sense because I feel it would cost a loss for the business at the new location.</p>

<p>3.) Have two separate websites with two separate names? I dont think I want to go this route because its a lot more work that would only result in duplicate content and confusion in Google search since its operated under the same Doctor Name. And The bought business has a complicated business name, and Long complicated URL.</p>

<p>4.) Keep the GlassesBrickle Business name for the practice but delete the domain.
Have EyeMiami5 be the main website for both, and SEO optimize the site so it pops up for both businesses. And just have like an opening slide or something say “Dr XXX – The Man Behind EyeMiami5 &amp; GlassesBrickle”. </p>

<p>and have the deleted GlassesBrickle domain redirect to the new site for the rare chance someone types the long GlassesBrickle address in the URL box.</p>

<p>----I have no idea at this point whats best, if you have any opinions please tell me what you think the best way to go is and why. If you have another idea please let me know, and if its possible provide evidence of your idea already in action with any other business.</p>

<p>Thank you for any help.</p>

<p>It's unwieldy to give a precise answer as the question stands. So a few questions to ask yourself:</p>

<ol>
<li>What are the costs and upside of keeping both sites active?</li>
<li>How much will a rebrand of this new business cost you?</li>
<li>In particular, will this new business lose clients by rebranding?</li>
<li>How much traffic is this new business' site getting?</li>
<li>Is this traffic comprised of useful, qualified leads, or is it purely random?</li>
<li>If the former, can you redirect this appropriate traffic to equivalent pages on the new site?</li>
</ol>

<p>If it makes sense to merge the two, do so. If not, do not.</p>

<p>My first thought is to discuss this with the owner and ask him what the plans are. What I am missing in your story is a direction for the future and if that is missing I would keep the site of bought practice online with minimal efeffort. It is not your responsibility to decide what route to take. It is your responsibility to advice and to give good advice you have to listen what the owner really wants with the new bought busines </p>
