<p>I saw a cool design template like a WordPress theme <strong>not</strong> a website and I just couldn't buy it, So is it illegal for me to create a website designed in the same way but using my own custom css,html and javascript.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>If the theme is indeed WordPress, the theme is covered under the <a href="https://wordpress.org/about/license/" rel="nofollow">WordPress license.</a> You may <strong>NOT</strong> use their graphics. Those are not covered and are considered creative works that are copyrightable.</p>

<p>You should still leave credit to the contributor within the css style comment header.</p>
