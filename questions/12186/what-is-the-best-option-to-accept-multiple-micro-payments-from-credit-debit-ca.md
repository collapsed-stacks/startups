<p>I'm looking into accepting multiple payments through a mobile app but these payments will be extremely small in nature. Anything from 1 USD all the way down to 5 cents. </p>

<p>I'm looking for which payment option would be best for these kinds of requirements. </p>

<p>Options I've looked at thus far charge a percentage and a set transaction fee, starting from 0.10 cents all the way to 0.30 cents. </p>

<p>Are there any services with free transaction fees with a monthly charge or has anyone else encountered this problem before? </p>

<p>Basically, what is the best solution to accept micro (5 cents to 1 USD) payments through a mobile application? </p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>I don't know about payment services and there might well be one fitting your description.</p>

<p>To solve your problem however, there might be another way (which is used by many apps, so I conclude your problem might not have a different solution, example: gold in candy crush, etc.). </p>

<p>Let customers buy credit instead of paying for every transaction at a time. You could say the first 5 dollars are due only if used up completely as a bootstrapping thingy. Then make the minimum credit purchase 5 or 10 dollars and the 0,1 dollars (or only cents?) fee won't hurt as much.</p>
