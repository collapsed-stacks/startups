<p>I have been working on this project for two months. With very minimal research. I am happy with what i have achieved and will continue to pursue further.</p>

<p>But late last week, I came across a company who is registered and have their MVP out and rolling. They have similar concept. They also have got some funding. </p>

<p>Now the product i am working on, only me and my friend knows. And the company already has their MVP out. Which means they should have already started with main-release prep. </p>

<p>Should I put my hand forward for collaboration(share) or should I stand against(competitors) the company?</p>

<p>Clearly, the company has the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-mover_advantage" rel="nofollow noreferrer">first-mover advantage</a>. And that plays a huge role and gives a significant edge when it comes to competition.</p>

<p>If your product has anything which does something significantly better than that other product, you'll always be playing catch-up with that company, and it wouldn't do any good to you or your product in any way.  So, collaboration is the most sensible way forward in your scenario.</p>
