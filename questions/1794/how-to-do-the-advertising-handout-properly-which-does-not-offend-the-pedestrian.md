An advertising handout is a small advertising paper or handbill or leaflet given freely or distributed free to the pedestrians.

Ok, this is what advertising handout people currently do. They stand in the public place like near station or in front of school, then they try to give the handout to everyone who walks through them. Normally, most people don't know what the handout advertises about (it could advertise a restaurant or a fitness club or a church) until they read the handout.

I believe that 95% of people who received the handout in the above situation will either throw away the handout or have never bored to read it. 65% will feel be offended cos someone disturbed them. Many people throw away the handout on the streets / stations.. and make the public places dirty. 

I believe that way of doing the handout is quite random and does not target the potential customers very well. Take me for example, I received like 50 handouts in station in 3 years period, but I have never visited any business advertised on the handout. I only read some handouts for a few seconds, and throw away the rest of them.

Then I tried to come up a different way to do the handout that does not offend the pedestrians. That is I will print what is my business about in a rather big paper (maybe 4 times bigger than A4), then I hold that paper in front of me and stand in front of station. When people walk through me, they will read the big text on my big paper and they would know what my advertising about. If they are interested, then they will come to me and ask for info or pick a free small handout leaflet from me. 

I believe that way of doing the handout is more effective cos it does not offend the pedestrians. However, that way is not really effective in reality. Actually, I tested that method in real world situation and found that I have too few people come to me. For example, 1/2 hour stood in front of station and there was only 1 person approached to me but she didn't even bore to take my handout leaflet.

I asked myself that why my new solution failed to attract people to take my handout? Maybe people couldn't properly read the text on my big paper? or for some reason I don't know?

So my question is that:

How to do the advertising handout properly that meet the following requirements:
    
- does not offend the pedestrians
- save resource (waste least handouts)
- only give the handout the one who actually interested in my business
- keep the public places clean because people will not throw away my handouts on the streets.
- 100% legal, that means the security people (in the station or in front of schools) will not have any good reason to stop me from advertising my business.


I am thinking about a new solution but not sure it is ok. That is I will record a voice message talking about what my business is about into a tape, then carry a cassette reader that can read that tape loudly and stand in public places. I then turn the cassette reader on and people can listen to what my business about and they can come to me to take the handouts if they are interested. But I am not sure if the security people will stop me cos I made the noise. But I could leave the volume small enough to attract only people who walk through me and not attract people who stand far away from me. 

**Have you tried this solution? does it work?** I saw many advertisers in developing countries doing like that.

I've no experience delivering leaflets in a street, but I can offer some fairly educated thoughts on advertising in general.

First off, I'd gather that your tests (where you showed an A4 ad) failed not because the idea was bad, but because your ad looked like dog food. So let's start with sorting that part out before discussing lead qualification and steering would-be interested passers by into a state of pre-commitment.

## Most small business advertising sucks

Here's why: if you open a random print publication, you'll see untold scores of *brand* advertisements that seek to do nothing except tie a slogan to a household name company. Apple -- Think Different. Nike -- Just do it. You get the point.

Notice anything? **There is no call to action.** Therefor, for a small business owner with a low advertising budget, **brand advertising is a complete and utter waste of money**.

And yet, having no insights on what actually works, they proceed head down into that dead-end, waste money a few times, and end up concluding that advertising is useless.

It's not.

## Small business advertising that actually works

**The purpose of a good advertisement is to get *qualified* leads to do a desirable action** -- for instance, to get more information about your small business.

In its shortest form, what counts is the headline, benefits, and a clear call to action.

The headline is the single most important part. You've a split second to take your reader by the throat and glue him to your copy. If it is not immediately compelling, it's game over.

I should add that the entire thing should be *focused* (and this is another mistake) on a single aspect of your business, and on getting your audience to do *a single action*.

Here's terrible and probably OK side by side to illustrate:

<pre>
<strong>
                                    GET A FREE REPORT
Joe's auto parts                   ON SNOW TIRE SAFETY</strong>

- Tires                             Brands and designs
- Batteries                          you can count on
- Breaks                           to drive your family
- Oil & filters                      with confidence!
- Accessories

 Call 222-2222
                                     Joe's auto parts                                    

</pre>
    
The one to the left basically yields: "*Meh* -- so what?"

Done properly, and to the right audience, the one to the right would basically scream: "I want to know MOAR! Tell me RIGHT NOW!"

At any rate, my point is, get this right before you even consider distributing ads on the street.

## On the street: qualify and commit your leads

I think you're on the right track with your A4 idea. Try a T-Shirt instead or in addition -- one in a color bright enough to attract the eyes.

Hammer your key value proposition onto it in large bold type. This means a one-phrase sentence that says what you're about. It's about what benefits you deliver do to who.

It should be catchy and in plain english; 10-12 words max.

For a legal firm specialized in traffic violations, it could be something like:

<pre><strong>
          WE BUST
          TRAFFIC
          TICKETS

</strong></pre>

On both sides. No logo, firm name or anything of the sort. Just one clear-cut message.

This will get some attention but it won't be enough. People don't really look at other people in the street; they focus on the person they're talking to whether in person or on the phone, or daydream some as they move to wherever they're heading.

You basically want to *interact with passers by* to get their attention.

Further, you need to do this with the intent of generating some kind of "Yes" statement -- even if it's one that they don't say out loud. Keep this *extremely short*, because you're going to be repeating it about a gazillion times per hour until you decide your brain needs some rest.

If you're a fitness club, for instance, try: "Hi! Like sports?"

Smile as you say it.

Intrigued stare that is wondering what you're about? Check. Attention grabbed.

Stared at your T-Shirt and not shaking head in disapproval or looking annoyed? Check. Qualified lead.

Now hand out that irresistibly good ad of yours, and they will not only take it but also probably read it...

Holy crap, I love this question! I too have never bothered to read or act on a leaflet... but how else are the people going to discover your product?

So you *could* stand in the cold and hand out leaflets to uninterested passers-by... but this is the digital age! Online advertising is so easy and accessible now, it doesn't take a lot of effort, time or money to get going.

If you're set on paper advertising (which it sounds like you are), I do like your idea of a large poster - it's like a personal billboard which would cost the fraction of the price of handouts.

I'd recommend placing your leaflets in local coffee houses - they'll often do it for free provided your business or product isn't direct competition. This saves you time because customers help themselves and also saves you money because they'll only take one if they're interested. Plus, local businesses want to be seen supporting local business. I've tried this in the past and it's been a pretty successul way to gauge interest and 
To be honest, It sounds like you're not a fan of being handed leaflets, so is it a good idea to promote your business through handing out leaflets?

Please, please, please don't record your voice and play it aloud in public places. It doesn't sound like a good way to promote your business and no-one could guarantee your safety.

Let us know which method you find most successful! It'd be interesting to find out which was most effective.
