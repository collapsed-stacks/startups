I'm thinking about using Google Apps for business. The question rise if it's a bad decision to use sensitive material (such as finance etc) and store it on their servers.

I'm not sure if I should use locally on a server here. But it requires a large amount of work to set it up securely.
What is the downside of using Google Apps for business? What do I have to think about when storing company data on Google?

I like the idea of it to be stored in a cloud so that my coworkers can work on the same document and be able for me to get the data whenever I need it. On my cell, home or whatever.

What should I do?
