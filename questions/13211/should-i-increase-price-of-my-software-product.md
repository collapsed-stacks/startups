<p>I am selling an accounting software from 5 years for all businesses at the price of 4000/- rs for life time (no any yearly amc or renewal).</p>

<p>My competitors are selling accounting software at more prices like 9000, 12000, 15000, 20000.</p>

<p>Note:- all my competitors have less functionalities or facilities them my software. This comparison ratio is they have 50 to 60 % less features then me.</p>

<p>They are costing yearly 1500 to 2000 renewal or amc charges. But I am not. My software doesn't need any amc or service because of perfection and no bugs.</p>

<p>After GST in india they all increased price to 15% to 40% or 100%.</p>

<p>So what should I do? I am thinking of increasing price from 4000 rs.(current) to 7000 rs. (after increment). So am I right? </p>

<p>What should I do? Which thing I should keep in mind?</p>

<p>99% of my customers are loving my software.</p>

<p>You could do a small research with your costumer base. Ask what they are willing to pay for your software. </p>

<p>In my opinion your prices could be higher. Even higher as your competitor. Because your costumers pay for lifetime access to your software. One time payment beats recurrent payments.</p>
