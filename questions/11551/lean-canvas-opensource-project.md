<p>I am modelling lean canvas for the project of opensource mobile applications which are connected to the backend. This backend is being sold as a service but you are free to customize the mobile applications and connect it to your own backend. We have opensourced the applications to draw the attention to the project itself and we make money from the customers who don't have their own development team.</p>

<p>My question is: should I model "developers" as a customer segment in the lean canvas as we are not making money of them? But the value they bring is the attention of the businesses around.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
