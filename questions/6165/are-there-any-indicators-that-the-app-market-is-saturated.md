The term "Startup" appears to be synonymous with "Apps", are there any publications describing the outlook of the so called "App" market? What's the overall sentiment surrounding businesses that are "App" oriented in such market?

I take it app means mobile apps and business is business that builds them  

You have a couple different types of apps  

 - stand alone  
games and  utilities   
business that build will continue to grow and these business should do OK     
the problem you have there is individuals can now write apps and market them   
the companies that market these apps (store) for piece of the action are the winners   

 - business extension    
mobile app for Amazon or my bank   
these will be more done in house or by the firm that does all their computing development   
in this area I see the specialty app business hurt as app development is getting main stream   

The App market as a whole is not saturated in my opinion.  App devices and software are only getting better.  The game market has been around for a while and it shows no sign of saturation.   Same for financial and desktop software.

App market is in its growth stage. Everyday lot of apps are getting in to market. Lot of companies(many E-commerce companies) are going App only. So I don't see any saturated App market.<br/>
Apart from that if you have a great IDEA which can run only on App the sentiment related to market should not bother you.
