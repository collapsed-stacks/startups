Explaining better, I wonder if a normal person, maybe an employee, can start a campaign on its own without actually being registered as a commercial activity.

Sure, why not? If you look around at e.g. https://gofundme.com or https://www.kickstarter.com/ you will see a lot of individuals. All crowdfounding platforms have a FAQ section which you should consult (or use the contact form) if you have doubts if the crowdfunding platform you are targeting has any limitations.

There's also a new kind of crowdfunding mechanism called "Initial Coin Offerings" or ICO.  I would definitely take a look into these before deciding on your crowdfunding platform.  There have been 100's of millions invested into ICO's this year alone, it is growing like crazy.  Main value is that the investment is freely traded from day one, investors like it more because it reduces risk for them (investment is much more liquid).
