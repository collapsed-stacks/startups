<p>I have a team of people, including myself, who are currently building/marketing an app for Android. What would you recommend doing in order to release the app? For example, should we form an LLC and release the app as a product of the company, should we trademark our app's name/logo, etc. All feedback is appreciated. Thanks!</p>

<p>Necessary: none.</p>

<p>Desirable: forming a company. It keeps things clean between you and your colleagues.</p>

<p>Operational: getting an accountant. Not legal per se, but you've no time to waste on this.</p>

<p>Wasteful until you've a proven market: registering trademarks.</p>

<p>Very wasteful in most cases: <a href="https://startups.stackexchange.com/a/3616/1824">filing patents</a>.</p>

<p>If you leave a link to your website/blog/product in your profile, it's like advertisement. Use all the channels you can get for free without spamming.</p>

<p>Don't forget to register all domain names you need. If you want to keep the trademark anyway for other products you can register it now in all relevant countries.</p>
