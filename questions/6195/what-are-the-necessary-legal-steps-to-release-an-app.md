I have a team of people, including myself, who are currently building/marketing an app for Android. What would you recommend doing in order to release the app? For example, should we form an LLC and release the app as a product of the company, should we trademark our app's name/logo, etc. All feedback is appreciated. Thanks!

Necessary: none.

Desirable: forming a company. It keeps things clean between you and your colleagues.

Operational: getting an accountant. Not legal per se, but you've no time to waste on this.

Wasteful until you've a proven market: registering trademarks.

Very wasteful in most cases: [filing patents](https://startups.stackexchange.com/a/3616/1824).

If you leave a link to your website/blog/product in your profile, it's like advertisement. Use all the channels you can get for free without spamming.

Don't forget to register all domain names you need. If you want to keep the trademark anyway for other products you can register it now in all relevant countries.
