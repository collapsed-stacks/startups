I am trying to get a startup on and I have planned out all of development and design. <br />
However, my skills are limited to UX Development and integration and I need back-end development and as a new startup my finances are limited and I cannot afford a programmer.

Is there any website where you can trade a skill set for another ?<br />
In other words, someone can trade UX for Dev or vice-versa.

I am not aware of such - but you have done well to acknowledge a weakness and to seek a solution. Some folk ignore their weaknesses and it eventually catches up on them.

I would suggest you broaden your skillset or take on a partner.

Me? I have good backend skills, moderate UX skills and less than attractive admin skills and I have depended on a friend and a good accountant to keep me on the right side of tax laws, including three audits, for more than 20years. It's not easy to find the right person but successful businesses are built in part on creative solutions and compromise. 

There are benefits to enhancing your skillset - despite your best plans, in the event your idea does not achieve the success you would hope for, you will, in the process have made yourself a better candidate to help deliver someone elses goals.

Best of luck

How about a co-founder with the skill set you don't have.

https://www.cofounderslab.com/

I have seen quoted (not sure if it is true (would love a citation if somebody has one)) that most successful start ups have two co-founders.
