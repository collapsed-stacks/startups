<p>I have a startup company based in the US with couple of small projects I did for 2 medium size companies. I have a website where we present our services with an amazing feedback from clients.</p>

<p>My questions is, how do sales people know how to contact a company? Whom do I contact in that company? Do I send them on LinkedIn? or do I call them at the office? Whom do I call, the highest manager? or the director? Who is the one taking decisions?</p>

<p>Any help is appreciated. </p>

<p>Following up on Denis' comments, your question is too broad. Perhaps if you mentioned the service / product you provide or the industry you are targeting, we could help to a greater extent. If you don't plan to hire a professional sales person, you really have another entire career to learn from scratch. Sales people really are a breed unto themselves.</p>

<p>However, there are two things I would recommend without knowing anything else about your company.</p>

<p>1) A shortcut to becoming a professional salesperson! I highly recommend that you read this excellent book, <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Bag_the_Elephant.html?id=Lwl9Pgx7vHwC&amp;source=kp_cover" rel="nofollow">Bag the Elephant</a>. It will provide you with a tremendous amount of information on how to identify which companies are your prime targets and also how to go after them.</p>

<p>2) Make the most of your past successes! If your past clients have good name recognition, use a quality press release / news wire service and tell the world about the great work you did for those companies (using your testimonials). I have had great success with <a href="https://www.send2press.com/" rel="nofollow">Send2Press</a> as an example. You should definitely spend a lot of time learning how to write a press release or pay the service to write it for you. Again, writing a good press release is almost a completely separate skill / career. These days it's just as much about optimizing keywords as marketing spin.</p>

<p>Good luck! </p>
