I am thinking of starting up a new job board / networking site, what would be the best platform to build it on? I also need a template business plan, where can I find one?

You can google the template business plan and pick one, however for the job board/networking site, you should probably have it custom made. Barring that, is you have some technical knowledge, you could probably use WordPress to create what you need. (at least for the most part).

However, some things to take notice:

 - There are a lot of platforms like this already. What makes yours unique?
 - Where and how do you plan on getting your user base?
 - Does(will) your platform at least reach the standards that the other big ones do?(UX/UI, design, content etc.)

Be aware that you are getting into an area that already has some very big players, and if you don't bring something unique to the table, you will most likely fail to get off the ground.
