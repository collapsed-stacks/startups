When it comes to ingesting & securing intellectual property (IP) within a startup, what workflow works best for startups that short-term creates a defensible, clear position for all parties, but doesn't result in unnecessary friction.

A few ways to clarify all expectations for employees and employers is to have a detailed portion of the contract with respect to intellectual property.

If the individuals working for the company are expected to produce IP for the employer and surrender all rights to said company than that should be explicitly spelled out in the initial contract as well as mentioned during the interview process.

As long as expectations are made amply clear at the beginning of the business relationship friction should be avoided in the long run.
