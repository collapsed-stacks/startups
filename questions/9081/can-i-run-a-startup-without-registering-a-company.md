<p>I want to create a small business which is going to sell digital goods on the web. Do I necessarily have to register a company? The tax policy in my country is not reliable, that's why I'm asking.</p>

<p>Some points from a previous answer I gave which you should at very least consider... Read points 1,2,3 and possibly 6 and 7.

<p>You have not said which country you are in, and 'digital products' is not clear however based on my experience within Germany and UK, you can get do business for up to six months and do the paperwork retrospectively. Its not the recommended method and you could raise a few questions from the tax authorities if your revenue is overly successful. </p>

<p>Starting a business is, in many countries, inexpensive (from the low hundreds to a thousand or so bucks). The risks of going into business without creating an entity will hold you personally liable despite your best intentions.</p>

<p>One inexpensive option to consider is

<p>I've only read about it, I have no part or contribution to it, nor do I have any experience of it. The decision you make should not be based on my recommendation.</p>
