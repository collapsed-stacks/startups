I have been working on a simple application that I will offer for free with built in advertising. I am based in the USA and want this app to work for Argentina and the USA. 

Do I have to create a company in both countries to distribute the app via Apple's AppStore? Google's Playstore?

Thanks for any and all information leading to an answer to this question.

No.

When you get to sharing/uploading your app in the Apple or Android store, you get to select where your app is distributed. You can select worldwide or specific to one or more countries. 

You can sell to anyone anywhere (so long as there are no sanctions or other legal issues).

Side note:
Bigger companies like Alphabet/Google create "sub-companies" to reduce liability and/or avail of tax advantages plus many other reasons. 

 - Liability: If your app disrupts or creates unintended negative
   effects, the company would be held accountable. Thus if all of
   Googles many businesses fell under one umbrella, and one of them
   screwed up, the law could penalise them based on their entire profits (which
   would have accrued via all the different businesses). If they
   had separate entities and one of them screwed up, then the penalty
   would more likely fall against that one entity leaving the rest of
   the businesses untouched.

 - Tax advantages: Many countries have favourable taxes offered to kids
   clothes for example. If you did kids clothes and adult clothes, you
   might want to split into two and maximise your tax benefits on your
   production of childrens clothes.

 - You also need to have an entity (company) if you employ employees -
   so if you have employees in two countries, each country's laws will
   apply and thus two companies would be required.
