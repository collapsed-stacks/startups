I've got a number of websites with Adsense ads and I'm keen to maximise the potential of them, but my ad units area is looking a bit of a mess with inconsistent naming etc. How am I supposed to organise the ads?

Organise by websites, then by pages, then by ad type (skycraper, leaderboard, etc.).

Tried multiple ways to organise that and it has been the best for me.

All depends if you have mobile applications / mobile website version too. 

You should organise at a top level by separating applications and website, then as the first answer, split by website. But I'll add that in "by website" you should regroup the mobile and desktop version too.

<p>My company recently wanted to do exactly what you are asking for so I will give you the results of my research.</p>

<p>The first thing you will need to take into consideration is on average, how many monthly page views are you receiving?</p>

<p>Double Click by Google is an Advert Management application which is free if you serve less that 90 million monthly ad impressions (ad impressions is a fancy name for ad views)</p>

<p>What it will allow you to do is assign your ad inventory (this is basically managing the space you have available for adverts on your website), create orders (this will be the ad-sense advert that you want to track), and generate the code you need to add to your website in order to track ad impressions and ad clicks.</p>

<p>Here is an image to show the UI for tracking your advert.</p>

<p>It's very easy to setup and I would suggest looking at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KpGSaQkiog" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this video</a> to guide you through the initial steps of setting it up.</p>

<p>I did comparisons over other ad management applications such as Broadstreet, OpenX and Revive, but after analyzing the features and also costs for the services, Double Click comes out on top. However I would suggest looking into the products listed as you might find they better suite your requirements.</p>

<p>It has some brilliant features such as automated report generation so if you have stakeholders who would like to review how many ad impressions your website is receive, you can easily set this up. You can also create accounts with read-only access so they can view them remotely.</p>

<p>If you find yourself struggling with it at all, feel free to drop me a message and I would be more then happy to guide you through the process to get you up and running.</p>
