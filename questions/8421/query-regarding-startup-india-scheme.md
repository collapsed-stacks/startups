I am from India and planning to register a new company, but on 16th January 2016 Prime Minister launched Startup India Scheme, under which the Government has provided many relaxations.<br />
 An app will be launched on 1st April 2016 for registration of startup companies.

Now my doubt is: <br />
Would I receive the benefits of the scheme if I register my company before 1st April OR should I wait for next financial year?
