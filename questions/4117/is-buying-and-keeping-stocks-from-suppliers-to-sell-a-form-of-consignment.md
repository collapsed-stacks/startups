<p>If I pay to buy an amount of stocks from a wholesaler, keep the stocks and sell it to my customers, do you call this method of selling <em>consignment</em>?</p>

<p>I used to think of this as consignment until I read recently that in consignment I wouldn't have to pay the supplier first, which in my case, I had.</p>

<p>The answer is in the question.</p>

<p>As you've correctly learned, in consignment you do not pay the supplier first, which in your case you have.</p>

<p>The OS X dictionary offers:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>agreement to pay a supplier of goods after the goods are sold: new and used children's clothing on consignment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So no, what you're doing is not selling on consignment.</p>
