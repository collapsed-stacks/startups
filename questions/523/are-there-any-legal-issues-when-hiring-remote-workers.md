<p>What legal issues will a US-based company faced when hiring non-US employees to work remotely from their own country? </p>

<p>Also, what does the process of hiring a foreign remote worker look like from a legal standpoint? Do you simply sign an employment agreement the same way you do with a US-based employee, or is there more to it?</p>

<p>The best option is to deal with a foreign company that provides services to your US based company. All you need from that foreign company is an invoice as a proof of services that they're billing you for. It's also good to have a proof that services were actually provided. If it's a software or design then it can be a good proof on its own. If there's no such asset (in case of SEO or other services), then email trails or documents exchanged could act as a proof.</p>

<p>Paying taxes and applicable fees is responsibility of the foreign company. You should not be liable for that.</p>

<p>It's also possible to work with individuals that same way, but certain foreign restrictions may apply to them as far as receiving payments from US company.</p>

<p>You hire them as consultants, not employees and that's it. Ask your accountant what paperwork he needs signed from them so that you're ok on your end (in my experience, it is very little).</p>

<p>In Norway at least, hiring remote workers is the same as hiring a consultant that manages his/her own company, but bills you by the hour. This means you won't have to pay for insurance etc. They handle their own income taxes and so on.</p>

<p>I have used Odesk before, and they seem to adress your question here: <a href="https://www.odesk.com/info/odeskpayroll_client/new/" rel="nofollow">https://www.odesk.com/info/odeskpayroll_client/new/</a> </p>

<p>There are numerous websites available for posting remote jobs but its hard to find reliable people for your project.  I used twice for my web <a href="https://www.officessupport.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.officessupport.com</a> but you'll want to research some jobs first. This site was directly suggested by my employer.</p>
