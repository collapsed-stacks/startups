<p>You don't need to report anything in France, but you might be liable for <a href="http://europa.eu/youreurope/business/vat-customs/cross-border/index_en.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">collecting VAT</a> at the EU level. Further reading on the topic with a few relevant links:</p>

<p>Assuming you'd like to do everything by the book, confirm the specifics with your client - their accountant who will know the gory details and walk you through what you need to do.</p>
