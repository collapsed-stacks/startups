I live in the USA. I'm starting to do Freelance work with a french company. I have a LLC. 

 - What should I be aware of?
 - I know I'll be reporting my taxes in the US, should I ALSO report taxes in France?

Thanks!

You don't need to report anything in France, but you might be liable for [collecting VAT](http://europa.eu/youreurope/business/vat-customs/cross-border/index_en.htm) at the EU level. Further reading on the topic with a few relevant links:

Assuming you'd like to do everything by the book, confirm the specifics with your client - their accountant who will know the gory details and walk you through what you need to do.
