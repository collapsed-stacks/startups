As an exercise, I am currently working on performing Market Research for a Hoover.  When trying to identify the potential Market Size, particularly across search platforms, would I solely only factor in those who are actively looking for Hoovers or would I also include those who are searching for things where I feel a Hoover would be of interest.  For example, would I factor in those who are performing searches such as 'How to clean a carpet' and 'How to get rid of dirt in Carpet' etc.  

In the context of Pay Per Click and SEO, I realise these search queries could be useful but would I include such searches as part of my Market Research in determining the estimated amount of people who may benefit from a Hoover?

What is wrong with traditional market size reports? 

Just search for vacuum cleaner market size. Couple of examples below. Some are free others are paid for.

SEO will help identify what people are looking for, but might work better to direct traffic to your website rather then understanding the size of the market. Something to consider, are you looking at the global or a local market?

I would suggest using the term "vacuum cleaner" rather then "Hoover"...
