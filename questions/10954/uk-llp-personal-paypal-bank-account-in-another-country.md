<p>I registered LLP in UK due to ease/low cost of getting started, trouble is that there is no way I can get bank account there.</p>

<p>I want to sell SaaS and accept payments via paypal(monthly subscriptions, mostly from US costumers) <strong>I already have paypal business account on my own name</strong> in another European country that I would use for this.</p>

<p>Could this work? I don't use that paypal / bank account for anything else and when business gets bigger I'd try to get proper UK bank account.</p>

<p>Setting up a bank account and a PP account in the UK with a UK business is trivial once you have a UK company with a UK based address. And the same for other countries.</p>

<p>What counts is to be able to to prove with actual paperwork that your business exists and operates at that address.</p>

<p>Two things that may have gone wrong in your case:</p>

<ul>
<li>You don't have a proper physical address anywhere? (Change registrar if so.)</li>
<li>You're trying to dodge taxes? (You shouldn't. As in, <a href="https://startups.stackexchange.com/a/1665/1824">really shouldn't</a>.)</li>
</ul>
