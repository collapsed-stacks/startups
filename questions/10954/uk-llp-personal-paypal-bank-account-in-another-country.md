I registered LLP in UK due to ease/low cost of getting started, trouble is that there is no way I can get bank account there.

I want to sell SaaS and accept payments via paypal(monthly subscriptions, mostly from US costumers) **I already have paypal business account on my own name** in another European country that I would use for this.

Could this work? I don't use that paypal / bank account for anything else and when business gets bigger I'd try to get proper UK bank account.

Setting up a bank account and a PP account in the UK with a UK business is trivial once you have a UK company with a UK based address. And the same for other countries.

What counts is to be able to to prove with actual paperwork that your business exists and operates at that address.

Two things that may have gone wrong in your case:

- You don't have a proper physical address anywhere? (Change registrar if so.)
- You're trying to dodge taxes? (You shouldn't. As in, [really shouldn't](https://startups.stackexchange.com/a/1665/1824).)
