<p>I am working on a design for a denim utility vest that I would like to get off the ground, but for that I need a source for the required type of denim. I'm fairly new to denim but I think that 15 oz should be about right for a vest designed to be both comfortable in a warm climate and durable, with a lot of pocket real estate. Where might I source quality 15-ish oz (ideally black) denim by the yard? </p>
