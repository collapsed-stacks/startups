edX has a [partnership with Amazon](https://www.edx.org/AWS-activate) whereby students who earns a verified certificate in one of their two Entrepreneurship classes become eligible for $1000 in Amazon Web Services credits.

The terms for eligibility are quite clear, except in one regards - if two founders of a start-up both qualify for the credits, could the credit be applied to the same team account# on AWS? Or can an account# be credited only once?

Yes the credit can be applied to the same account. Please see the following from their FAQ :

> If we have a team account for AWS, how could we apply the $1,000 credit to a team account?

> When you apply on AWS make sure to use your teamâ€™s Account #. Whatever Account # you provide to edX is the one that will be associated with the credit.
