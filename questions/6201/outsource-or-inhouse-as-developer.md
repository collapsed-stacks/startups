Our StartUp has two advantages:

- We are web developers and are able to develop our product by our own
- We have some connections and we know we could outsource our project

But we have one big problem: We lack of time and still are bound to other projects.

Now, we are from Germany and we would have to pay high wages to get someone with the potential to do our tasks. But this guy will sit next to us and we would have full control over him. Problem is, we only need him for the time of development, after that, we would have no task for him.

We also build up some contacts to partners outside of Germany, which are able to develop way cheaper, then we could do. (Think of it as: If I develop one hour on this project, i will loose one hour on an other, paid project. Which is about twice the amount, i would pay to our partner)

What would you suggest in such a situation? We have the capabilities, but also have way cheaper alternatives. We also only have few experience with outsourcing, but still are into the topic of web development, so we can distinguish between good and bad quality.

We thought about some kind of mixture, but we are really stuck on this topic.

<p>I think outsourcing works, if you know what to outsource. Let me explain --</p>

<ul>
<li>If you are product co. and you have non essential tasks like building automated UI tests, since you dont want to recruit test engineers right away. It makes sense even to outsource your legacy product maintenance, since you want to go full speed with new version.</li>
<li>If you are into services and you want to scale then outsourcing works. But threading there would need some extra work initially till you have good understanding with outsourced individual/team/co.
Most troubles come when things are put blindly without deep monitoring(code reviews, status updates, demos etc...)</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is a <a href="http://smallbiztrends.com/2013/03/why-when-what-how-outsource.html" rel="nofollow">link</a> which talks similar concept of what to outsource etc..
Doing everything by yourself makes sense till you do not have steady flow of customer requests, once you have steady flow and you think you can scale your company higher, I would prefer to start hiring or outsourcing work. If you have already worked with an outsourced partner he can come real handy here.</p>

<p>On the topic of outsourcing, I'd be extremely wary and careful as to who and where you outsource. You mention having contacts outside of Germany, I'd be very careful with that particular scenario. </p>

<p>There are plenty of cases in which people in Asia do in fact steal your idea, likeness, etc for their benefit on recent example can be found below</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-08-27/heard-of-china-s-fake-rolexes-now-there-s-a-fake-goldman-sachs" rel="nofollow">Fake Goldman Sachs China - Bloomberg</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Now onto the other scenario in which you mention hiring - temporarily - someone to pretty much build it all to then send that person off the minute the work is done. While I understand the intentions make business sense, I'd recommend being up front and honest regarding the task, expectations, and end-result.</p>

<p>This person may or may not be interested in your arrangement, if they are not, it is likely because they will want some type of equity IF your product/project appears to be to he/she as a potentially lucrative financial draw.</p>

<p>Your other option which I believe is mentioned, could be to actually approach an application design and development company such as the ones below (FYI I'm not affiliated with any)</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://fueled.com" rel="nofollow">Fueled</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.como.com" rel="nofollow">Como</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.appmachine.com" rel="nofollow">App Machine</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Good luck on your venture.</p>

It sounds to me like you guys need an additional founder who can be focused on the business aspects of what you do.

The good news is that the world has many more of those then people who are able to develop products online well. 

So be very selective, try to find someone who is ambitious, has good ideas, and who is a giver or matcher and not a taker, and then give these problems to him or her.
