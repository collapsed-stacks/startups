<p>I work in a government parastatal, it collects revenue on behalf of the government and recently they have rolled out a new integrated system; "Integrated Customs Management System" but apparently they need a new name for the system, "a competitive name"  and also a tagline..</p>

<p>any suggestions.
the system is for collecting customs revenue contrary to domestic taxes.
but it also has interfaces for input of data by almost all necessary government agents, multinationals and partners etc.</p>

<p>also, what is the difference between the system name ad the tagline?</p>

<p>what i have:
**</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Name:    Kenyan Customs Management System (KCS)</p>
  
  <p>Tagline: Trade Facilitation &amp; Global Security</p>
</blockquote>

<p>**</p>

<p>or 
**</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Name: Kenyan Customs Electronic Data Interchage System (KCES)</p>
  
  <p>Tagline: Trade Facilitation &amp; Border Security</p>
</blockquote>

<p>**</p>
