I used to work for a software company that dominates a niche market.

This market is one in which consumers demand the same product because they need to share data with each other in a trusted format. Kind of like a PDF, but for a particular kind of financial model.

Basically everyone builds their own models in Excel, etc., but shares with each other in this other format.

I could possibly build a better product, but there's no point because I would not be successful without the sales and marketing ability to promote widespread adoption when there is already a capable and trusted product on the market. It just would never happen.

But it's not a complicated product, and if I could offer it for free, and -- here's the killer question -- What if I could import/export this company's file formats? Or directly push data into the back end?

Is it legal to do that in any way?

If I can import and export their files, I think I have a shot.

Would I inevitably face eternal lawsuits for having worked there in the first place and starting this kind of company? (I quit a while ago to work at another software company).

I don't know where the line is drawn. For example, Open Office and Google Docs can open Microsoft's DOCX, DOC file formats and others. I'm not a lawyer, but I'm sure if Microsoft said no one else could open their files that wouldn't fly.

Talk to a lawyer  

The format has legal protection or not.  Have they filed a patent on the format.  

Even before PDF was an open spec a third party could still open or create PDF.

Postsript is a format that was (and maybe still is) legally protected. There have been formats with legal protection but very rare.  Look up patents on Postscript.

<p>First thing is, it completely depends on the country you life in, if such a thing is illegal. The only real answer on that part is: "Got to the lawyer of your choice"</p>

<p>But there are maybe other things you may need to consider. For example some (most?) employers introduce some kind of "You are not allowed to do the same as we do for 4 Years"-section within the employment contract. This will definitely end in some kind of conflict.</p>

<p>About the format, well there are proprietary formats out there. And .doc and all other office file formats are protected, but Microsoft more or less released a free of charge licence/promise/what ever it is (If you want do delve deeper into that: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_format" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia on proprietary formats</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Open_Specification_Promise" rel="nofollow">MS Open Specification Promise</a>). Have you ever read the general terms of your former company offerings?</p>

<p>I think, a more essential question you have to ask yourself: How do i distinguish from the other company? Is there a way to improve efficiency (Doing things right => results in lower prices for customers) or improve effectiveness (Do the right things => results in satisfaction of your customer) so the customers will leave your competitor? Do you have have access to the customers, and if so how to reach them?</p>

<p>I just try to tell you: The possibility of creating a product is nice, but it has no use, if you can't reach your market.</p>
