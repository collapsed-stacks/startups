Ok, I submitted my idea a few times to YCombinator and all of the times I received this info in their email after they reviewed my idea:

    

> Thank you for applying to Y Combinator; however, your startup was not
> selected to interview for the upcoming Y Combinator batch....

My question is that how many people in the world submitted their ideas to YCombinator & how many percent was selected. Out of the selected ideas, how many were actually receive the checks from YCombinator?

What they said implies that my idea may be very good, but others' are much better and thus they will pick the best ones. In my opinion, that (the way that YCombinator selects startups) is not the best way to find the best startups. How YCOmbinator is so sure that the idea of the StartupA is better than StartupB? Maybe there r 5000 applications and only 30 got selected.

SO I want to find a startup incubator that can sponsor for 60-80% of the good ideas. 10% of these ideas can receive money from that incubator and the rest of these ideas can only receive their advice. By doing that, the incubator can have more chances to find successful startups since there are more ideas were put into action.

So my question is:

**is there any startup incubator that is more flexible than YCombinator?**

<p><strong>Here's the whole email you received, which provides information related to your questions:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thank you for applying to Y Combinator; however, your startup was not
  selected to interview for the upcoming Y Combinator batch. We
  carefully reviewed thousands of applications and since there's a limit
  on the number of startups we can interview in person, we had to turn
  away a lot of promising groups. It's alarming how often the last group
  to make it over the interview threshold ends up getting accepted to
  YC. That means there are surely other good groups that fall just below
  the threshold.</p>
  
  <p>Unfortunately we can't give you individual feedback about your
  application. This page explains why: <a href="http://ycombinator.com/whynot/" rel="nofollow">http://ycombinator.com/whynot/</a></p>
  
  <p>We sincerely hope and encourage you to reapply for the next batch.
  Applying multiple times in no way counts against you and a
  surprisingly large number of companies are funded after applying more
  than once.</p>
  
  <p>We're trying to get better at this, but it's practically certain that
  groups we rejected will go on to create successful startups. If you
  do, we'd appreciate it if you'd send us an email telling us about it;
  we want to learn from our mistakes.</p>
  
  <p>-- YC</p>

<p>In my opinion, it's not possible to answer this question in part because "flexible" is meaningless to me. </p>

<p>Sounds as if you're asking for free advice, which to my knowledge is always available, all you have to do is ask. For that matter, YC is in fact already sharing a lot of free advice; for example, see "<a href="http://startupclass.samaltman.com/lists/about/" rel="nofollow">How to Start a Startup</a>"</p>

  <p><strong>How Y Combinator is so sure that the idea of the Startup-A is better

</blockquote>

<p>They're not, though they have a process, and historically speaking it appears to work. The core of the process is that they invest in people, not ideas.</p>

Well, YC has 13-15k application per batch, and 40-60 companies that got in.

Its hard, but my question is - how are trying to succeed if do not manage to hack this way and beat only 15k competing companies? Cuz while running your business you gonna compete with 15k*100000 different issues that can beat down on your knees. Every.Single.Moment.

If you think that YC give you cash for the privilege to "recieve your idea" - you are wrong. 

You better find a job
