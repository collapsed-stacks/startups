<p>In a situation where one startup is performing work for another, is it a good idea to use Venmo for the transaction? The founders would use their personal accounts and then withdraw/deposit money with the business bank account.</p>

<p>This seems like an easy solution for online payments that aren't recurring. The advantages are the lack of fees and not having to meet in person or mail a check. Are there any disadvantages beyond the slight hassle transferring money between business and personal accounts? I don't think this would be a long term solution anyway.</p>

<p>You should <strong>not</strong> mix personal and business accounts.</p>

<p>First, it makes your taxes more complicated especially if you are ever audited.  In audit, the IRS will be going over your accounts with a fine toothed comb so best to keep your personal accounts out of it.</p>

<p>Second, you can lose the limited liability protections provided by your company.  One of the benefits of having a company is that the owners' personal assets are not in danger when the company is sued.  If someone sues your company for $1 billion, then your company goes bankrupt but you get to keep your house.  If you are mixing accounts, then you might lose your house too.</p>

<p>It looks like Venmo doesn't yet have business accounts, so you should mail a check or use a PayPal (or some alternative) business account and just pay the processing fees.</p>
