<p>I'm in the US and am investigating available remedies for customers that do not pay for services offered.  My business model allows users to try a service and pay for it only if they are successful using it.  I set it up this way to attract more users so that they will worrying about paying for a service if it does not work for them and want to keep it this way for now.  I know I am taking a big risk by allowing this to happen and want to plan for the few customers that may not pay.</p>

<p>I am planning on sending customers with amounts past due for more than 30 days a letter that states my company has a policy for customers that are past due.  I want to state I will report amounts past due if they remain unpaid for more than 90 days to Trans Union, Equifax, and Experian and resend that letter again if unpaid after 60 days, then final letter at 90 days and actually report.</p>

<p>I went to each credit reporting website and requested information from each but did not find a simple form to fill out to submit an unpaid amount.  Has anyone actually done this?</p>

<p>Lastly, if a customer does not pay after 180 days, I do not think it would be worthwhile to continue trying to collect and am not planning on suing them.  I will probably forgive this amount but feel that the customer should not have used the services for free.  I would like to report a 1099-C to the IRS because the customer did not pay and then they will have to report the value of the service as income.  I am not sure if this is allowable because my business is not a lender and financial institutions are <strong>required</strong> to file <a href="http://www.irs.gov/instructions/i1099ac/ar02.html#d0e280" rel="nofollow">IRS Form 1099-C</a>, but the site does not say if other institutions are <strong>allowed</strong> to file.  Anyone know if non-financial institutions are allowed to file this form?</p>

<p>I understand this is more of a legal questions and I do have a counsel retained, but they are only familiar suing customers to recover past debts and not with these methods.</p>

<p>1099-C is a cancellation of debt. This is used when a loan is not being repaid and is being written off (either fully or partially, most commonly in cases of foreclosures or short sales in real estate).</p>

<p>You provided services with allowing customers not to pay for them, and then you're trying to charge them and treat the customers that refuse to pay as if they took a loan from you. You then go on and and report the discharge of the loan by filing the 1099-C.</p>

<p>However, there was no loan. No customer promised any payment to you - you allowed them to use your service without paying.</p>

<p>If you're a cash-based taxpayer - you didn't recognize any income at all, so there's nothing to discharge. If you're an accrual-based taxpayer, you only recognize income when you invoice the customers, but customer not paying your invoice is not necessarily in your debt. He didn't agree to the charge to begin with, so you can't claim debt until there's a judgement in your favor.</p>

<p>In any case, you cannot report a debt discharge to the IRS unless there's <em>no chance</em> of collecting the debt. If you don't even try to sue the people who you claim owe you money, I don't think you can satisfy that requirement.</p>

<p>Bottom line, as I said in the comment - talk to a lawyer that can explain this to you. If your current lawyer doesn't understand what a debt discharge is and how it is reported - then you should fire that lawyer and find another one.</p>

<p>Do not engage in such a predatory practice without an <strong>excellent</strong>, nothing less, legal counsel.</p>
