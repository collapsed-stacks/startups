I am sorry but I could not find an answer to my question nowhere. We have a reserach project with Hololens(Microsoft) and Samsung Gear VR(which are virtual reality headset). But the thing is after developing an app to them we want to sell product(Hololens or Gear VR) and app together. Should I apply to Microsoft or Samsung to be a partner to sell my product? Do I need any licence to sell? or Can I sell it directly without permission? In short what should I do to sell my app and their product together?

Check your contracts with them. They probably rule out selling directly without permission.

For the rest, basically ask them. It's the only way you'll know for sure.
