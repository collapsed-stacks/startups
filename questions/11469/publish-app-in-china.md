if I want to publish app in China (complete free, without any in-app purchases), are there any legal issues?

I read that you need resident ID card (person) or local branch office (company) to publish apps in China, is it right?

<p>Because the Chinese government maintains iron-fisted control over Internet service throughout the country, there are some real requirements you have to meet in order to get your app published.</p>

There are more than 200 Android app store in China and Google play is only a small fish. For iOS, almost the same like other countries.

ID card is required by third-party Application Market, company info is optional or not strict.
About Android APP:as you known, Google is not accessible in China without VPN, so Google Play is not recommended.
But there are other third-party Application Market(Xiaomi, Baidu, Tencent, Qihu360 all have their own Market).For example, Xiaomi Application Store, here is its [tutorial](https://dev.mi.com/doc/p=129/index.html).
