I can think of a few things that a logo can have an impact..

A logo can help:

- People remember your business (preferably in a positive way).
- In the marketing side, because that is were it all starts; like the design of contact cards, etc.
- Increase your sales if placed in the right places.
- Clients decide if you are a better company than the others, depending on the logo

Conclusion: A logo is very important because ultimately it will help you generate more money for your company.
