<p>I can think of a few things that a logo can have an impact..</p>

<p>A logo can help:</p>

<ul>
<li>People remember your business (preferably in a positive way).</li>
<li>In the marketing side, because that is were it all starts; like the design of contact cards, etc.</li>
<li>Increase your sales if placed in the right places.</li>
<li>Clients decide if you are a better company than the others, depending on the logo</li>
</ul>

<p>Conclusion: A logo is very important because ultimately it will help you generate more money for your company. </p>
