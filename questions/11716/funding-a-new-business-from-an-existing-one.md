<p>I am looking at setting up a new business. 
I currently have a UK Limited company with an amount sat in the bank (lets say Â£10k) That I would like to use to fund this new (unrelated) startup, which will also be a Uk LTD company.
The money will be paid back to the first company as quickly as possible. </p>

<p>What is the most tax efficient way to use funds sat in one business to fund a another startup business? 
Some sort of "Loan" agreement?</p>

<p>This is a UK based question.</p>

<p>You need qualified advice. My suggestion is this. </p>

<p>You're never many days or many miles from someone running a seminar on R &amp; D Tax Credits. Find one that's convenient, and sign up.</p>

<p>Whatever the content of the presentation, your question is, "What other approaches should I consider to optimise tax efficient investment in a new venture?"</p>

<p>Use the occasion to get an idea of different approaches, and the dynamics of each. If you don't hear about anything other than tax credits, book another seminar with a different speaker.</p>

<p>Just like pursuing product/market fit, the best and fastest learning often comes from guessing at an answer, and using that to engage with the market.</p>

<p>I am not an accountant however,</p>

<p>A loan between company A and Company B should have no further implications on tax (Beyond the fact that they are already associated companies through your presence in both) because loans do not effect profits.</p>

<p>There are probably complicated ways of doing it but many of the tax relief schemes I know of for small businesses cannot be claimed by 'connected' people.</p>
