In cooperation with 2 small theatres I've made Mac app [Subtitles for theatre][1]. Now I'm looking for ways how to deliver the app to more theatre professionals - mainly theatre directors and dramaturgists.

Where would you suggest to get relevant influencers or PR? What approach would you apply?

You could hire an inexpensive freelance PR person to write a press release for you. They would need to talk with you about the app and find the "sizzle" (the thing that would make it newsworthy).

Once it's written, you or the PR person could distribute it to various sources. You could research whom to submit it to, like entertainment blogs & magazines. The PR person should also be able to recommend some sources. And remember that it's free to email press releases to Associated Press.
