<p>In cooperation with 2 small theatres I've made Mac app <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=1098298120&amp;mt=12" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Subtitles for theatre</a>. Now I'm looking for ways how to deliver the app to more theatre professionals - mainly theatre directors and dramaturgists.</p>

<p>Where would you suggest to get relevant influencers or PR? What approach would you apply?</p>

<p>You could hire an inexpensive freelance PR person to write a press release for you. They would need to talk with you about the app and find the "sizzle" (the thing that would make it newsworthy).</p>

<p>Once it's written, you or the PR person could distribute it to various sources. You could research whom to submit it to, like entertainment blogs &amp; magazines. The PR person should also be able to recommend some sources. And remember that it's free to email press releases to Associated Press.</p>
