I am from California. I want to use my home as a classroom to tutor students. I am not sure what laws I should look for. 

For example, do I need to have a license for private group tutoring? Moreover, does my home need to have any special license? If yes, would it be excepted if the group of students is less than certain number of people?

It would be nice if there is a website which say talk about that. Suggestion and information are very welcome. Thanks

This will depend completely on your local town/city/county ordinances and laws. (I'm assuming California is not wacky enough to have state-wide zoning laws, but you can never predict California).

> It would be nice if there is a website

Your local town/city/county will probably have a website that includes your local ordinances, zoning laws, etc. Try that. Alternatively, just go down to your city hall / county office and ask the business licensing desk / zoning official. These people deal with home-based businesses and zoning as their jobs and will be able to give you a lot of information.

If that's not enough (or if you get push-back from the local authorities), you could also ask a local attorney for the most reliable information.

<p>There are places on the internet you can go to get pithy legal questions answered like this. For a small fee. You can Google: <code>ask a lawyer</code> and look at the organic search results to find them.</p>

<p>For example, I just did that <a href="https://www.rocketlawyer.com/legal-advice.rl" rel="nofollow">and up popped this site</a>.</p>
