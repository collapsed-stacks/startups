<p>I'm moving to US and I need to move my company from UK to California.</p>

<p>Here some informations of my company:</p>

<ul>
<li>Total Gross incomes ~$150k/Y, post costs :  ~$110k/Y</li>
<li>Total turn around NET ~$70k/Y (last year UK tax return)</li>
<li>1 director (that is also employee in another company)</li>
<li>working from home (any claimable tax benefit would be useful, especially on rent/mortgage)</li>
</ul>

<p>Any suggestion would be really welcome!
Thanks</p>

<p>Limited liability protection in the US is very well defined as long as the actions are done on behalf of the company and the actions are not criminal.</p>

<p>A previous comment suggested using a sole proprietorship, which is simple to make, but it is not a legal entity and there is no liability protection.</p>

<p>If you want your company to be a separate legal entity and shield your personal assets from any liability that arises from the company, then form either an LLC or a Corporation.  This needs to be filed in a state and its usually easiest in the state where you are located depending on your needs.</p>

<p>See the article from the <a href="https://www.sba.gov/blogs/should-my-company-be-llc-s-corp-or-both" rel="nofollow">US Small Business Association</a> on the differences between the LLC and Corp structure (along with info on an S-corp that simplifies your tax returns)</p>
