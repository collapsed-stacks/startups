I'm moving to US and I need to move my company from UK to California.

Here some informations of my company:

- Total Gross incomes ~$150k/Y, post costs :  ~$110k/Y
- Total turn around NET ~$70k/Y (last year UK tax return)
- 1 director (that is also employee in another company)
- working from home (any claimable tax benefit would be useful, especially on rent/mortgage)

Any suggestion would be really welcome!
Thanks

Limited liability protection in the US is very well defined as long as the actions are done on behalf of the company and the actions are not criminal.

A previous comment suggested using a sole proprietorship, which is simple to make, but it is not a legal entity and there is no liability protection.

If you want your company to be a separate legal entity and shield your personal assets from any liability that arises from the company, then form either an LLC or a Corporation.  This needs to be filed in a state and its usually easiest in the state where you are located depending on your needs.

See the article from the [US Small Business Association](https://www.sba.gov/blogs/should-my-company-be-llc-s-corp-or-both) on the differences between the LLC and Corp structure (along with info on an S-corp that simplifies your tax returns)
