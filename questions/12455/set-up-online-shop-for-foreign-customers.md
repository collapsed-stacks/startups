I'm looking to start an online storefront that will sell household, over the counter products like toothbrushes, toiletries, etc. to customers in foreign markets where there may be shortages of these items.
I would sell with wholesale or single item options.

Besides the obvious of setting up a storefront is there anything else that I would need to consider or do?

Shipping restrictions, tax, and legality.

Shipping Restriction - Check with your shipping partner which country they cant/wont ship to.

Tax - Some country have entry tax for foreign items. Make sure your customers are aware of that

Legality - Some countries ban the most trivial of things, make sure you check those and impose a rule accordingly. (Ex: Singapore bans chewing gum)

The best way would be to register as a marketplace seller instead of having a own website. International shipping would always require customs clearance and this might be a problem to get clearance for certain products. 
A clear approach would be to take orders using your store front and fulfill them using the local merchant. 
You should also consider the currency conversion rates if customers want to pay in local currency.
