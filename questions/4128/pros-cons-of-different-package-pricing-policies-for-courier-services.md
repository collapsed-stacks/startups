I am starting a courier service, which for now will be ground-based and at the state level. The service will handle delivery of documents to boxes as large as two-feet-squared (2'x2'x2').

Trying to understand how and why we should charge for courier services. For example, should we charge by the package's dimensions, weight, or a combination of both? 

I see some companies use:

 - **Linear Measurement.** For example, airlines allow free baggage of size `l+w+h <= 158cm`
 - **Dimensional Weight.** For example, [USPS has flat rate boxes][1] that used fixed dimensions and disregard the actual weight of the piece up to 70 pounds.

What are the advantages and disadvantages of these different methods?
