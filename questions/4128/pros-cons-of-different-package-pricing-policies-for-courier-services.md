<p>I am starting a courier service, which for now will be ground-based and at the state level. The service will handle delivery of documents to boxes as large as two-feet-squared (2'x2'x2').</p>

<p>Trying to understand how and why we should charge for courier services. For example, should we charge by the package's dimensions, weight, or a combination of both? </p>

<p>I see some companies use:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Linear Measurement.</strong> For example, airlines allow free baggage of size <code>l+w+h &lt;= 158cm</code></li>
<li><strong>Dimensional Weight.</strong> For example, <a href="http://postcalc.usps.com/PopUps/PMMediumFRBox.htm" rel="nofollow">USPS has flat rate boxes</a> that used fixed dimensions and disregard the actual weight of the piece up to 70 pounds.</li>
</ul>

<p>What are the advantages and disadvantages of these different methods?</p>
