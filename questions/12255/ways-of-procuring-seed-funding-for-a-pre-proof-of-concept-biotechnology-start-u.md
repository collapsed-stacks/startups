I have been working on an idea for a biotech project, and I am exploreing how I can find enough funds to build a early proof of concept. I am placed in Paris. 
Being a biotech idea, it would require some lab space and by my estimate upto 50,000 euros in the first year. 

Some routes I am thinking about include :

1. Business plan competitions
2. Biotechnology Incubators like La Paillasse, Genopole etc. 
3. Finding a lab and a PI which will allow me to do a PhD on the subject, as I start-up simultaneously. 
4. Crowd funding

I want to discuss the Pros and Cons of the approaches, and see if there are any other routes available.
