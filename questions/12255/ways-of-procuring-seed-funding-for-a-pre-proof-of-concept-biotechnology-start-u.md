<p>I have been working on an idea for a biotech project, and I am exploreing how I can find enough funds to build a early proof of concept. I am placed in Paris. 
Being a biotech idea, it would require some lab space and by my estimate upto 50,000 euros in the first year. </p>

<p>Some routes I am thinking about include :</p>

<ol>
<li>Business plan competitions</li>
<li>Biotechnology Incubators like La Paillasse, Genopole etc. </li>
<li>Finding a lab and a PI which will allow me to do a PhD on the subject, as I start-up simultaneously. </li>
<li>Crowd funding</li>
</ol>

<p>I want to discuss the Pros and Cons of the approaches, and see if there are any other routes available.</p>
