## How can one use terms consisting of generic words that have been trademarked?

Here's the best example I can find:

One-A-Day Vitamin D

In this case the company, Bayer, has trademarked the "One-A-Day" portion as a brand:

http://www.oneaday.com/

As a hypothetical scenario, let's say I also sell Vitamin D under my own brand.  Let's say I want to create an ad that say something like:

"Quality Vitamin D, Take One a Day"

or

"Quality Vitamin D, Take One a Day for Normal Results, Two a Day recommended."

Does this collide with Bayer's trademark/s?

How can one use these generic terms without running into issues.  After all, most doctors tell their patients "take one a day for two weeks" when issuing prescriptions.

This is an example. I am not selling vitamins but I find this example aligns closely with the situation I am looking at.

<p>Trademark law is tricky, and takes a law degree, and a lot of experience to get it down. Its also a portion of the law where both sides have won.</p>

<p>Since I'm no law expert, I defer to <a href="https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/metaschool/fisher/domain/tm.htm" rel="nofollow">harvard law school</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A trademark is a word, symbol, or phrase, used to identify a particular manufacturer or seller's products and distinguish them from the products of another.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>then further down about trademark infringement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To be more specific, the use of a trademark in connection with the sale of a good constitutes infringement if it is likely to cause consumer confusion as to the source of those goods or as to the sponsorship or approval of such goods</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So moral of the story, if people are likely to confuse the two products, then yes it is infringement. In your story, the doctor saying "Take one a day" is not likely to make you confuse the vitamins, and thus does not constitute infringement. </p>

<p>The example of the ad is a little more tricky, but I would still hold that it doesn't constitute infringement. It is an example of what is called fair use:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fair use occurs when a descriptive mark is used in good faith for its primary, rather than secondary, meaning, and no consumer confusion is likely to result. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This means that you are in fact talking about the product itself, not making a marketing statement. they use an example of kellogg's:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>a cereal manufacturer may be able to describe its cereal as consisting of "all bran," without infringing upon Kelloggs' rights in the mark "All Bran." Such a use is purely descriptive, and does not invoke the secondary meaning of the mark.</p>
</blockquote>
