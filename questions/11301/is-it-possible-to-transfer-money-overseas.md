<p>You have a few options, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>PayPal: The sender and the receiver, both, much has PayPal accounts (the fee for each transaction is 2.9% plus $0.30 USD of the amount you receive). </li>
<li>Western Union Money Transfer (According to Western Union's website, Western Union charges a $5 fee for a standard EFT/ACH delivery and a $22 fee for expedited wire transfer delivery, as of September 2014. There is no fee to send a check to the payment recipient.)</li>
<li>You can visit your bank and check the procedure to transfer money to a particular country. It's a time consuming process though. The paper work not so much but usually takes about 7-10 working days (depending on the country) </li>
</ul>

<p>Personally, I prefer PayPal due to it's least hassle way of working. </p>

<p>In addition to the options Chiragh, raised check out <a href="https://transferwise.com" rel="nofollow">Transferwise</a>, by the creators behind Skype.</p>

<p>It basically is a peer to peer wire transfer of sorts that takes out the bank as a middleman. There might be a few other similar options out there.</p>
