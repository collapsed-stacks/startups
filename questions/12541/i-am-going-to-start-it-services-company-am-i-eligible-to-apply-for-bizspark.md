<p>Yes, with the information provided you can apply for Bizspark.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>if you are a software startup (not a consulting firm), less than 3
  years, making less than 1M$ in annual revenues, you WILL be accepted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, take note that you need to be registered company.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>BizSpark does not accept IT companies moving in consultant/service business. They will only accept your company if you can show them your existing products/plan/prototype</p>
