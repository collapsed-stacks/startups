Looking forward to your responses.

Thanks.

Yes, with the information provided you can apply for Bizspark.

> if you are a software startup (not a consulting firm), less than 3
> years, making less than 1M$ in annual revenues, you WILL be accepted.

Also, take note that you need to be registered company.

Hope this helps.

BizSpark does not accept IT companies moving in consultant/service business. They will only accept your company if you can show them your existing products/plan/prototype
