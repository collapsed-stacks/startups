<p>I am developer with some experience and a few ideas for startup that I would like to develop into some proper products. The problem mostly I face is that I am not good at the sense of design and sales and marketing and stuff like that. So I would like to build a team to complete the project(s) so I can see the physical shape of my product. </p>

<p>The problem to be precise is that I am developer doing a full time job and I do not have enough money upfront to hire expert people for my team but I am looking for some people who can work on the terms of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweat_equity" rel="nofollow">sweat equity</a>. </p>

<p>I think you're thinking too far ahead in this venture. If you're a developer, build your product first. It doesn't need to look good, it doesn't need to be perfect, but it should be a decent prototype. It should be something that you can show off to people and they will see what your vision is and how they can improve it.</p>

<p>I'm a developer by trade and back in college I made a pretty cool app. I developed the whole thing, backend/frontend, put it on the app store, and was done with it. The problem was I am not at all a designer, and it looked awful. I reached out on craigslist and reddit to ask for designers. I offered 20% of the app sales for someone handle all the design work and make it look pretty. I found a great guy who made a killer design and it was just a great end result overall. I think the key here is to go as far as you can without a any help, and only pull in people when you need them. These days you hear "Hey, listen to my start-up idea" every other block. If you focus and create your product, it shows that you are already willing to put in the "sweat" so someone else is much more likely to join you as they see your passion. </p>

<p>Finding great people who are willing to work for sweat equity (stock) is very hard. As the joke goes: great, works for free, pick one.</p>

<p>The key is usually to find people who are passionate about your space and your product. From there, find who is really good. Sweat equity only serves to provide some amount of fairness to what is most likely an insane risk. People who are not passionate about your space just want a paycheck, which you can't provide.</p>
