I'm technically good, and I have amassed some impressive networks on Linkedin and Twitter which I am refining. However, how can I effectively utilize these kinds of services to approach people to 
 

 1. Build working partnerships and   
 2. Find truly engaged followers and customers? 

It feels counter-intuitive to approach people online like 'cold calling' but even without the voice on the end of the phone, yet somehow online networking seems to be the flavour of the moment.

How does one build trust and value going down this route?

Put theory to practice!
 
First test, share content that begets engagement. For example,Twitter allows you to post polls, that can be a simple first step to test engagement from followers. Start a conversation with followers by tweeting them, or commenting on their tweets. Twitter also offers insight that can help you better understand your network. Post relevant content on both platforms, particularly on LinkedIn which allows users to share blogs, articles, etc. Think inbound marketing. Not only will this help identify engaged followers, but also attract new ones i.e. the "truly engaged customers" you refer to. 

I've received DM's on both platforms from people interested in my services, or asking me to take interest in theirs. I can tell you the latter didn't work so well for them. I do however, believe you can finesse this interaction by applying simple psychology. If your goal is to foster a partnership with an individual on LinkedIn or Twitter, then say so, and explain why you believe this person has value. A simple compliment on the quality of their content, or the impressive work experience they've had will often be enough to break the ice and allow you start a conversation.

Final point make sure you track this data(no brainer but still). Hope this gets you thinking creatively and helps you reach your goal!
