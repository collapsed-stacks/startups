Is there a category name for a company like Dollar Shave Club or Warby Parker? Where they deliver an incumbent product at a better price with a de-emphasis of traditional distribution models. 

Similar to "marketplace" for Ebay, Reverb, etcâ€¦

At its core, DSC is a subscription-based business. But more specifically, it could be categorized under the subscription box model.
