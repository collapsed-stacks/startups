<p>I'm thinking of applying for bizspark for my new startup. However, I've already been in a previous start up (which failed and has disbanded) which was in previously in the bizspark program 4-5 years ago.</p>

<p>Is it possible (and not frowned upon) to apply for bizspark again?</p>

<p>I should note that I'm working with a different team for these two startups and they are completely different products.</p>

<p>Since BizSpark accounts are linked to <em>Businesses</em>, 
You may utilize BizSpark for different <em>Businesses</em>. </p>

<p>You may also need to sign up with a different business email, business name..etc to distinguish those businesses.</p>

<p>One <em>company</em> can work on multiple ideas, and that all at once, or in groups, or sequentially as the management thinks best.</p>

<p>A company can join BizSpark once. And then stay in the program for either 3 years or until a revenue of Â½ / 1 million dollars per year is reached.</p>

<p>Hope that helps.</p>
