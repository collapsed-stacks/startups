I'm thinking of applying for bizspark for my new startup. However, I've already been in a previous start up (which failed and has disbanded) which was in previously in the bizspark program 4-5 years ago.

Is it possible (and not frowned upon) to apply for bizspark again?

I should note that I'm working with a different team for these two startups and they are completely different products.

Since BizSpark accounts are linked to *Businesses*, 
You may utilize BizSpark for different *Businesses*. 

You may also need to sign up with a different business email, business name..etc to distinguish those businesses.

One *company* can work on multiple ideas, and that all at once, or in groups, or sequentially as the management thinks best.

A company can join BizSpark once. And then stay in the program for either 3 years or until a revenue of Â½ / 1 million dollars per year is reached.


Hope that helps.
