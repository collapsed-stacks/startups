<p>I would recommend some sort of field sale.
The reason for this, is the opportunity to get in touch with your customers. The chance to talk and listen to your costumers, can be very valuable for any startup. </p>

<p>Let them know who you are and how reach you. This will build a stronger relationship and give you some very valuable direct feedback.</p>

<p>Blogs and social media is also very good and can give you other sorts of information about your customers. It could be a good idea to think data about your customers in to a strategy here. e.g.</p>

<ul>
<li>Media habits - What social medias do they etc.</li>
<li>Geographic location</li>
<li>Age</li>
<li>Gender</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are many great and free tools to help you monitor your online presence. You can learn more about that from this blog <a href="https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/306/integrated-platforms-for-social-email-marketing">post</a>.
Hope that helps a bit.</p>
