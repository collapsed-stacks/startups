<p>I'm an independent contractor working for a startup. I've been given the option to purchase some stock of the company at current pre-funding value. How do I represent this on my US taxes?</p>

<p>I am not trading work for equity: I have been given the specific option to purchase these shares.</p>

<p>Since you are an independent contractor, you cannot have been granted "statutory options".  Your options are instead considered to be "non-statutory".</p>

<p>From what you have said, it is also likely that your option does <em>not</em> have a "readily determinable value"&mdash;for example, it is neither traded on an established market nor can you make a risk-free gain from its immediate exercise (as might have been the case if the underlying stock was currently trading for more than the strike price on an established market).</p>

<p>As such, you do not have any income tax liability for the options until either:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>they are exercised and the resulting stock becomes substantially vested (i.e. is not subject to any restrictions under which you might be required to give it back)&mdash;you then recognise taxable income of the difference between the option's strike price and the stock's then fair market value; or</p></li>
<li><p>you transfer the option&mdash;you then recognise taxable income of the value thereby received <em>and</em> if transferred in a non-arm's length transaction, you subsequently recognise further taxable income (of the difference between the option's strike price plus the received value and the stock's then fair market value).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>See the <a href="http://www.irs.gov/publications/p525/ar02.html#en_US_2013_publink1000229198">Stock Options</a> section of IRS Publication 525 ("Taxable and Nontaxable Income") for more information.</p>

<p>For IRS purposes, you do NOT have an event when you purchase stock. You will need to keep the amount that you paid, however, for tax purposes.</p>

<p>The taxable event occurs when you SELL the stock.</p>

<p>If, as unlikely as it may be, the company you work for pays a dividend, then that is a tax event also.</p>
