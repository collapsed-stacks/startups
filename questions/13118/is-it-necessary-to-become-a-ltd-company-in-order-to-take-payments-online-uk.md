To self host an invoice/payments system (the only way I can get one to work as I want - branding/security/customisation reasons), one would need an SSL certificate. I am told that it needs to be the OV sort, which means the organisation's name and address needs to be validated, and I understand it needs to be a ltd company.

The sole trader company only has a small turnover, and I don't want my personal address appearing online. I'd like clients to be able to pay their invoices online, and it needs to be self hosted in order to work as required. This also helps with automating admin activities like chasing payments.

A Ltd company offers other advantages regarding Apple Developer accounts for app development also (the same issue - personal name used unless its a Ltd company).

However, with such a small turnover, the expense and complication of becoming ltd is restrictive. Is there another way around this?

It's not _necessary_, in that you can operate as a [sole trader](https://www.gov.uk/set-up-sole-trader) as you've already discovered, but it's highly recommended.

Ltd stands for limited company, as in limited _liability_. If a disgruntled customer sues you as a sole trader or an individual, your house and other assets are on the line. If a disgruntled customer sues your limited company, the worst that can happen is your company's assets get wiped and you shut the business down, thereby protecting _your_ house and other assets.
