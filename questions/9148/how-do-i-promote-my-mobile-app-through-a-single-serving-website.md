<p>I have an app that i created with a friend. It's a simple joke app that consists of a single button, and a few funny voices. That's it!</p>

<p>Our "marketing plan" was to create an interactive <a href="http://howifeelaboutthat.com" rel="nofollow">web version</a>, with links to our app in the appstore, and try to promote it through clever posting on facebook/reddit comments. The more people who like it, the more upvotes, the more traffic to the site, the more downloads. Unfortunately, this strategy seems to be failing...</p>

<p>I've since reached out to the creator of <a href="http://instantrimshot.com" rel="nofollow">Instant Rimshot</a> (the sort-of inspiration for our idea) who told me that he got his big break when a major blogger mentioned his site in an article. Unfortunately, i have <em>no</em> idea how to expand my network to include bloggers, without looking like a desperate spammer...</p>

<p>Our code is great, the design is pretty, the voices are funny...but the right people don't know it exists. Any ideas?</p>

<p>Bloggers usually have credibility because they can't be bought. So yes, you will likely become a desperate spammer and not an over-night sensation. </p>

<p>Ideas:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You can keep trying to reach out to the people you do know, try to make new friends, etc. to try to expand your "organic reach" to promote your app.</p></li>
<li><p>You can try more novel approaches (balloons?  whatever...) and hope that gains traction. </p></li>
<li><p>Probably a better approach, but less intuitive, is to <em>build another app</em>. It's amazing what you will likely learn during that process. You will have to rethink a lot of things. Having more than one app makes it easier to reach a larger audience in general. In fact, build a couple more and then look back and it's like you will have some great insights into what you can do to improve your current app, its marketing, its appeal, etc. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>It's likely the creator of Instant Rimshot had more than one idea that didn't work - regardless, that's how most stories go. You hear about the wins and not the losses. Keep at it!</p>
