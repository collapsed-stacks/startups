I have an app that i created with a friend. It's a simple joke app that consists of a single button, and a few funny voices. That's it!

Our "marketing plan" was to create an interactive [web version](http://howifeelaboutthat.com), with links to our app in the appstore, and try to promote it through clever posting on facebook/reddit comments. The more people who like it, the more upvotes, the more traffic to the site, the more downloads. Unfortunately, this strategy seems to be failing...

I've since reached out to the creator of [Instant Rimshot](http://instantrimshot.com) (the sort-of inspiration for our idea) who told me that he got his big break when a major blogger mentioned his site in an article. Unfortunately, i have *no* idea how to expand my network to include bloggers, without looking like a desperate spammer...

Our code is great, the design is pretty, the voices are funny...but the right people don't know it exists. Any ideas?

Bloggers usually have credibility because they can't be bought. So yes, you will likely become a desperate spammer and not an over-night sensation. 

Ideas:

1. You can keep trying to reach out to the people you do know, try to make new friends, etc. to try to expand your "organic reach" to promote your app.

2. You can try more novel approaches (balloons?  whatever...) and hope that gains traction. 

3. Probably a better approach, but less intuitive, is to *build another app*. It's amazing what you will likely learn during that process. You will have to rethink a lot of things. Having more than one app makes it easier to reach a larger audience in general. In fact, build a couple more and then look back and it's like you will have some great insights into what you can do to improve your current app, its marketing, its appeal, etc. 

It's likely the creator of Instant Rimshot had more than one idea that didn't work - regardless, that's how most stories go. You hear about the wins and not the losses. Keep at it!
