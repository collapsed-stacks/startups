I am acting as CTO for a start-up with a good business idea, but I want to bring in a 3rd party for App development, rather than bring in contract/permanent staff.

Although I am an IT manager, I don't know how to find or attract a small development houses short of trawling through hundreds of (mostly poorly written) websites and contacting all of them.

Has anyone else had experience in identifying a Dev house and engaging with them?  Are there any sites around where I could post a high-level outline to attract interest?

As i understood you, you search for service providers, not employees.

If so, you could do different things:

- Freelancer Sites: First thing is of course to search on certain sites, which are dedicated for this topic, like freelancer.com. Of course you also have to accept higher rates of better rated members
- Recommendations: Ask people you know, if they could recommend someone, whos able to fulfill your needs.
- Search products: What I did a few times, is to search for products, like e-Mail templates, Upload Scripts etc. at for example theme forest. If you like what you see, just ask for an offering. You already have a proof of their skills and they may are interested.

If you want to, I of course could recommend some studios. Just write a comment. But the ways above should deliver one or two good alternatives already.

First of all, I suggest you to choose the country, where you intend to find the developers for this project.
    Globally, each country has pros and contras. In the USA, the UK and all around West Europe you will find professional and expensive developers. From the other side: Asia is much more cheaper and at the same time difficult to work with (a lot of multicultural problems, language difficulties and miscommunication, low quality work).
      So, East Europe could be a good balance of price and quality: Poland, Romania, Ukraine provide such service at an affordable price.

Based on my personal experience, the most effective way is to visit the contenders personally before the final decision. 

Here are some relevant step-by-step advises how to choose the 3 party app developers:
