I read a few years ago about that model, that a company bought laptops for their employees. And the employees own this laptops after 3 years, while they pay for them from their salary.

But they do not pay the whole price, just (I do not know exactly) 75% of the price. And after the three years it is their laptop.
On the other hand the company has the full tax depreciation.

So it is a win win - developers have their own dream laptops and the company almost doesn't pay anything for it.

I am looking for a working model of this ... or a better specification.
