This is an exact quote from a lawyer friend of mine, "The USA is the easiest place to file a lawsuit."  I saw a few other threads about where is the easiest place to set up a startup that were too generic, so this thread is much more specific.

In terms of this question to be much more specific, what country(ies) are:
1.  Difficult to file lawsuits against businesses
2.  Low cost of living for startups
3.  Encourage startups through favorable taxation

I can't imagine more than three countries total exist; from my research, I've found some countries that have one or two items on that list - like Singapore is more difficult to file a lawsuit than the US, but has a very high cost for startups.

The three seem contradictory with each other. It's a bit like that old joke about consulting: competent, available, cheap; pick two.

Related question in passing, which will hopefully make you revisit your search:
