If a non-technical person comes up with a software-based startup idea, is there any way for them to contribute meaningfully, especially in the founding stage?

To make things more concrete, let's say there are three founders for such a startup:

* a logistics person
* a designer
* a software developer

Could that combination work out at all for a software startup?

Is there any success story where technical people do not form the majority of the founders?

Sure. There's no shortage of stuff that you can do to take work off of your two co-founders:

- Administrative work
- Testing the software, giving feedback/ideas
- Finding testers
- Preparing/running the UI/UX tests
- Finding clients
- Finding indirect sales channels
- Finding angel investors
- Organizing the logistics if any
- Creating the landing page to build a list
- Animating the mailing list once it's around
- Being active online to grow the list
- etc.

Apple had three founders:

- Steve Jobs: CEO, Marketing & Sales
- Steve Wozniak: Engineering
- Ronald Wayne: Administrative / Design / "Adult Supervision"

<p>The combination what you have mentioned definitely works. Yes, there are many success stories where tech-companies are started by non-tech people. I agree to the list stated by @Denis de Bernardy, regarding the roles a person can take.</p>

</ol>

<p>Now, here are some of the points from my end.</p>

<ol>
<li>Success of the company depends not only on the skills and the people but various factors like passion, the field/problem that you are planning to solve, your stratergy etc.</li>
<li>There are success stories not only by Non-Technical persons, but by the people who have not even completed their education properly. So, it all depends on how strong and dedicated you are and how you adapt yourself and your idea to the situations</li>
<li>Start-up by Tech People only, doesn't guarantee success because they may be only focussed on technology. Hence many tech-founders will be looking for non-tech co-founder to manager many other things of the company</li>
<li>Being a non-tech doesn't mean that you shouldn't learn Technology. Technology, doesn't mean coding. Technology means, you keeping yourself up-to date about the latest trends. What worked, what hasn't clicked. What essential features make the application make or break etc etc</li>
<li>Very imp. Your business shouldn't solely depend on the Tech-Founder of the team. That's dangerous, because the moment the Tech-Person changes his mind and plans to walk-out, then business will be in trouble. Other founders too, should have equal knowledge about what they want to build and what should be their road-map</li>
<li>Very Essential thing: You should have the skill of Getting-Things-Done. If you have that, then you can hire the best talent and get your plans executed, or even you can outsource and test the water [Eventhough I won't recommend this most of the times]</li>
</ol>

<p>Hope this helps you a bit. My wishes for your venture/attempt. Good Luck :-)</p>
