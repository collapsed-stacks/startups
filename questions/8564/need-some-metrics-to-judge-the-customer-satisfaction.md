Not sure if this is the right place to ask this question but I am looking to have a comment card printed out for my new store. I want to have a comment card where i can easily judge how my business is doing in the eyes of the customer. For now i am adding following metrics:-

 - **Atmosphere**
 - **Value for money**
 - **Quality of products**
 - **variety of products**
 - **friendly service**

[all of these will have values - bad - normal - good - excellent]

I am not sure this covers all of bases. And want to make sure i didn't miss anything. 

**Nature of business**: it would be a shop for ladies, gents clothes + accessories, etc.

You could consider adapting Google's HEART metrics: 



> **Happiness**: measures of user attitudes, often collected via survey. For example: satisfaction, perceived ease of use, and net-promoter
> score.
> 
> **Engagement**: level of user involvement, typically measured via behavioral proxies such as frequency, intensity, or depth of
> interaction over some time period. Examples might include the number
> of visits per user per week or the number of photos uploaded per user
> per day.
> 
> **Adoption**: new users of a product or feature. For example: the number of accounts created in the last seven days or the percentage of
> Gmail users who use labels.
> 
> **Retention**: the rate at which existing users are returning. For example: how many of the active users from a given time period are
> still present in some later time period? You may be more interested in
> failure to retain, commonly known as “churn.”
> 
> **Task success**: this includes traditional behavioral metrics of user experience, such as efficiency (e.g. time to complete a task),
> effectiveness (e.g. percent of tasks completed), and error rate. This
> category is most applicable to areas of your product that are very
> task-focused, such as search or an upload flow.

<p>The <a href="https://www.cobloom.com/blog/saas-metrics" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Net Promoter Score (NPS)</a> is most commonly used for quantifying customer satisfaction, and it could work as a comment card just as easily as it does in an online context.</p>

<p>The NPS uses a simple survey question:</p>

<p><em>"How likely are you to recommend 
[your company product] to a friend or a colleague?"</em></p>

<p>Respondents are then asked to choose a corresponding score, on a scale from 0 ("Not at all likely") to 10 ("Extremely likely"):</p>

<p>Your Net Promoter Score is then calculated by subtracting the percentage of Detractors from the percentage of Promoters. A positive score suggests more people willing to recommend your business than those trying to dissuade others from visiting you - you're receiving a net promotion - and vice versa.</p>

<p>For example, if you handed out 10 comment cards to your shoppers, and 50% of respondents were promoters, and 10% were detractors, your NPS would be 40:</p>

<p>As far as benchmarks go in retail, according to <a href="https://npsbenchmarks.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">NPSBenchmarks</a>, consumer brands manage a meagre average NPS of just 43.</p>
