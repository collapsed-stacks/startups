<p>We have a SaaS business model with options to pay a monthly or annually subscription fee. Also in the beginning as a attraction for sponsors we will be offering a lifetime membership for anyone who gives over a certain amount. How would we go about determining the monthly, annual and lifetime subscription rates for a online service with no current user base? What factors should we take into account?  </p>

<p>Personally I would factor in the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Costs such as start up costs, salary, customer acquisition costs and etc..</li>
<li>Close competitor's prices</li>
<li>Since you are starting a business, you should understand your market and with that information you should have a feel of what customers are willing to pay.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are other factors as well but with those 3 I think you should be able to come up with a profitable margin.</p>
