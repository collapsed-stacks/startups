<p>My question sounds sinister but that wasn't my intention. </p>

<p>I'm working on a service that a user subscribes monthly or annually. That same user takes payments from their customers.</p>

<p>I've been looking at Stripe which caters for both of these requirements. The issue is the charge per transaction. It would force the client to up their prices or sacrifice 2.4%+flat fee of their revenue. </p>

<p>I could take the brunt of the charge use the monthly fee to pay for it, but the problem is when the users fees exceed the monthly subscription fee.</p>

<p>What services / models can I use that don't affect the end users experience or my bottom line?</p>
