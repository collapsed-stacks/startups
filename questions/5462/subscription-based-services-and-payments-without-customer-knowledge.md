## Subscription based services and payments without customer knowledge

My question sounds sinister but that wasn't my intention. 

I'm working on a service that a user subscribes monthly or annually. That same user takes payments from their customers.

I've been looking at Stripe which caters for both of these requirements. The issue is the charge per transaction. It would force the client to up their prices or sacrifice 2.4%+flat fee of their revenue. 

I could take the brunt of the charge use the monthly fee to pay for it, but the problem is when the users fees exceed the monthly subscription fee.

What services / models can I use that don't affect the end users experience or my bottom line?
