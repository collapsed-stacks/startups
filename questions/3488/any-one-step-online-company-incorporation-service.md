<p>I saw a lot of online incorporation services, like :
<a href="https://valcu.co/" rel="nofollow">https://valcu.co/</a>
<a href="http://startupr.com/" rel="nofollow">http://startupr.com/</a>
and
<a href="https://www.clerky.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.clerky.com/</a></p>

<p>They seem pretty seamless and quite cheap, but none of them seem to provide bank account opening and virtual address in the US.</p>

<p>I live in Hong Kong (I'm not a US citizen), I would like to open a Delaware corporation (requirement from my investor)</p>

<p>Any online tool would do, as long as it's painless.</p>

<p>Any of you had experience doing this ?</p>

<p>EDIT :</p>

<p>After deeper research I found out that remote opening of a US bank account is impossible for non-US citizens. You have to go there at least once.</p>

<p>But, the good news is a US company doesn't <strong>have</strong> to have a US bank account !</p>

<p>So I will simply open a US company with a HK bank account. In my case it should do.</p>

<p>Opening a bank account in US is a separate process and has other additional requirements thus it is typically not included. May be it is better if you can try and work with a local law firm in Hong Kong that has experience in it.</p>
