I saw a lot of online incorporation services, like :
https://valcu.co/
http://startupr.com/
and
https://www.clerky.com/

They seem pretty seamless and quite cheap, but none of them seem to provide bank account opening and virtual address in the US.

I live in Hong Kong (I'm not a US citizen), I would like to open a Delaware corporation (requirement from my investor)

Any online tool would do, as long as it's painless.

Any of you had experience doing this ?


EDIT :

After deeper research I found out that remote opening of a US bank account is impossible for non-US citizens. You have to go there at least once.

But, the good news is a US company doesn't **have** to have a US bank account !

So I will simply open a US company with a HK bank account. In my case it should do.

Opening a bank account in US is a separate process and has other additional requirements thus it is typically not included. May be it is better if you can try and work with a local law firm in Hong Kong that has experience in it.
