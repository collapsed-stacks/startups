I am helping a friend with the promotion of his start-up, and I have never done this before therefore I would like to know where and how to start. 

The goal of the company is to collect all kinds of materials (plastic, metal, glass, etc.) from the people in a relatively big city and recycle. The materials will be later processed and sold. 

The purpose of the promotion is to reach the locals and make them sort the products by categories and instead of throwing them in the same bag with the organic products, give it to us. My friend's company would come and pick up the garbage for free, and he would even offer bags and containers for free!

Now my part... I followed multiple advice on different websites, and I helped with the website and the facebook page, but apparently, people don't react to the posts which show call-to-action (e.g., Recycle with us!). In a previous post, someone told me that Facebook is not the best way to promote it and now I can see that. I have created some infographics and videos with the whole process and paid for sponsored posts on Facebook. 

Some people reacted with likes, but only one person registered to the program. 

I personally don't know what else to do to convince new people. I know things take time, but one "real" reaction in two months is an unfortunate scenario. 

I think it would be much easier if the company would sell products and then have like offers and stuff, but how can we get people to sort the garbage and then choose this company for recycling? 

Can anyone help me with any advice or does anyone have any experience with this? We are opened to a lot of ideas.

You're an offline business doing offline work. You can throw in a website as an online FYI if you really feel like it, but don't expect anyone to follow you. The only venue that actually matters to reach out to your user base is offline.

Your main options probably are offline things like:

1. Sending an information letter to literally every postbox in the city. (A/B test in a few areas before doing a broader campaign.)
2. Offline advertisement - be in billboards or other - around venues that soak in lots of local traffic, like large shopping centers or movie theaters.
3. Distributing flyers in the street.
4. Organizing or participating in local events.
5. (Because you're into recycling specifically) Advocacy groups like your local green party branch.

"Online" options include things like:

- Advertising on radio networks - local ones, but also regional or national ones that allow you to target your target area only.
- Advertising on local TV networks - but this is a lot more expensive. (Regional and national networks likewise work too provided it's targeted.)

AdWords and Facebook ads are basically a non-starter: it might be a sampling error, but I've yet to meet anyone who is actively googling how to recycle their waste. I do know many who do, but it's primarily because the municipality embraced recycling and has multiple bins to that effect. Methinks work on local public opinion and municipalities.
