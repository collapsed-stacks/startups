We regularly need to capture basic contact info (name email, phone) during events. This needs to be quick to maximize the number of people we can speak to (sometimes over 500/day).

Currently we are writing it on paper but its a hard task to digitize the information later.

I would love suggestions for an Android app that can capture this info easily. It should work offline and be able to export, sync the info later.

<p>A simple, and cheap, way to do it would be to create a form with something like <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/forms/about/" rel="nofollow">Google Forms</a> and have it post the data into a workbook. The forms render pretty well in a mobile browser from which point you can either input the data yourself or ask the other person to do it.</p>

<p>When you're done the data is easily exported into a .csv so you can work with it in a different environment.</p>

With the help of event networking applications you can gather your users information really easily. Some cost the event organizer some don't.

[This one](http://getchain.com/) is used widely in Middle East & East Europe

[This one](http://www.bizzabo.com/) is used more in Ca & Vegas

A few more [here](https://pathable.com/), [here](http://www.jujama.com/) and [here](http://zerista.com/).

Sometimes an analog solution is worth considering. If quantity of names is the most important part of the collection, consider asking for business cards, putting them in a bowl with a drawing for a gift card or something. Then get one of those business card scanners and it will OCR the cards into a spreadsheet for  you.

Granted, business cards are becoming less popular these days. As a digital alternative, ask people to tweet you or follow you on twitter.
