Let's say you have a generic photo sharing app. You hire 5 employees to badger all of their contacts to spam your app across their school and work mail distribution lists.

Let's say each employee has 100 good friends with access to 10,000 reader mailing lists. That's 5 million impressions right there.

Let's say that 80% of the receivers never open the mail and 80% of the rest bounce and never register for your shitty app. That's 200,000 users with practically no investment.

Sounds realistic?

If there is one piece of advice to keep in mind about predictions like these it is this...

The only thing you can know for certain about your predictions is that they will be wrong... And that is ok.

Predictions should be used as goals to reach.

If these goals seem like something that you and your team can reasonably accomplish, then set out a detailed plan of how you get there and take action.

Personally I think that those numbers are a little high but without detailed information about your sales team and their connections it is very difficult to say. Nothing is ever as easy as it seems though.

Good luck to you!

I believe your numbers are too high:

- People who are willing to spam their friends for money (your employees) will probably not have many good friends left. The meaning of "good friends" here being the one you defined: "friends who are willing to forward spam".
- In turn, these 100 friends (if they find 100) who are willing to forward spam, will probably already have been blocked from these mailing lists.

Another thing: there will probably be a lot of overlap, with some of the 100 coming from the same backgrounds (same universities etc) and thus tending to be on the same mailing lists, and the final readers being registered on several related mailing lists.
