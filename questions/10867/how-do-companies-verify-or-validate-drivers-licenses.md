<p>How do companies like Intellicheck or Jumio validate drivers licenses? Is there a service from government offices like the DMV that they can check against? Are they simply just visually inspecting the IDs without government validation?</p>

<p>There is a government program called E-Verify (<a href="https://www.uscis.gov/e-verify" rel="nofollow">here's the link</a>) that helps employers verify the identities and work eligibility of potential employees. </p>

<p>All identification cards issued in the United States must now meet the Real ID standards (<a href="https://www.dhs.gov/real-id-enforcement-brief" rel="nofollow">link to Homeland Security page on this</a>).  No doubt there are other methods, but these are two ways that I know of. </p>

<p>Yes. At least some State governments seem to provide online services that allow to check a license based on its digits:</p>
