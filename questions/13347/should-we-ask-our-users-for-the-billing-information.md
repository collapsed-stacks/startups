<p>Should we ask for the user's billing information at the checkout page from the legal perspective?</p>

<p>Currently, we're using the  following fields:</p>

<ul>
<li>First Name</li>
<li>Last Name</li>
<li>Country</li>
<li>Address line 1 and Address line 2</li>
<li>City, Province, and Zip Code</li>
</ul>
