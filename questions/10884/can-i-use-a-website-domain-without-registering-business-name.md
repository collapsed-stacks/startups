<p>In Canada, you may register a business name through your province. This is required to legally operate a business that excludes (or combines) the founder's name. If you only use your legal name as the business name, no registration is required. </p>

<p>I want to start a website designing business that uses a domain name other than my legal name. Although the business will run under my name, <strong>can I use a domain name that isn't my name?</strong></p>

<p>For an example:</p>

<p>John Doe runs the company, "John Doe", however, he uses the domain, "Awesome.ca".</p>

<p>If this is legal, in which way would one provide proof that the acting business name is "John Doe" (no other paperwork/registration is required to start a business)? Note that I do not hire employees, do not import foreign goods, and am not required to emit HST. </p>

<p><strong>True.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Yes.</strong> Domains are not strictly for business purposes and a domain does not have to correspond to a business name, even though the practice is common. While some top-level domains may have specific requirements (eg. <code>.ca</code> requires one to be a Canadian resident or Canadian legal entity), there is no requirement that you own a business that corresponds to a domain name. If there was such a requirement, only one person with any unique name would be able to be in business at at time -- and that would just be silly.</p>

<p>The only circumstance that would prevent you from owning a domain is when someone owns a legal trademark that matches a domain. (Even then, you could own a trademark for the same name if you're in a different line of business, but that's far beyond what you're asking.)</p>

<blockquote>

<p><strong>You don't have to provide proof.</strong> It would be nice and useful to your customers, however, if you disclose who you are, where you're from, and how you run your business.</p>

<p>For <code>.ca</code> domains specifically, <a href="https://cira.ca/" rel="nofollow">CIRA</a> (the operator of the <code>.ca</code> domain) has the personal details on each registration.</p>

<p><em>Aside: Make sure you have good reasons to act as a sole proprietor rather than structuring your business as a liability-protected entity. Even though the simplicity may seem attractive, you are taking on a lot of personal liability doing business that way.</em></p>

<p>Yes, you may. You don't usually register a 'business,' per se. What you register is a company. A company, in simple terms is an artificial juridical person.</p>

<p>Now your company may have different products and services. Your design-wing of the company may be called something very different from your company name. Just the way that Apple Inc owns <a href="https://www.icloud.com" rel="nofollow">https://www.icloud.com</a> (iCloud) and uses it for business etc.</p>

<p>I hope that helps!</p>
