<p>We have developed an initial product for our next company in the tech sector, but I am unsure of when to incorporate.</p>

<p>I already own a company in the tech sector and am using this company to bootstrap the new one.</p>

<p>Some details:</p>

<ul>
<li>All the current expenses are being managed by my original company.</li>
<li>Contractor agreements are signed by the existing corporation. </li>
<li>New founder agreements are signed with the new company name. </li>
<li>The original corporation is a California S-corp. </li>
<li>The new corporation will be a Delaware C-corp.  </li>
<li>There is no revenue in the new company yet.</li>
<li>The existing company is cash-flow positive, but funding the new company
with the same accounts.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am waiting primarily because of the money and risk. The existing company can fund the expenses of the new company while in an early phase. If I were to move a big chunk of cash (EBIT) from one company to the other, I would have to pay tax on it as an investment, reducing cash flow everywhere.</p>

<p>What have other people done in regards to bootstrapping like this?</p>

<p>I've been down this road.
I personally would wait to incorporate the new company until it's clear it's got momentum. That's what I did, however, the newer startup didn't work out so it did save the costs of an incorporation and there were tax benefits.</p>

<p>IMHO, forget the overhead- just create momentum first. </p>

<p>My view, (and I think it's shared with most people who have been in business for a while) is that, at the startup phase, the whole world and a sock puppet are not out to get you or steal your idea. Clearly worded written agreements are enough to protect you at this point.</p>

<p>The exception might be if you accept investment or need to make partners happy, but still, if the amounts are small, and it was me, I'd even just use a personal name for the first little while.</p>

<p><strong>Side note:</strong> If you have a side business then, at the time of this writing, Aug 2014, most incubators will give you a hard time. They are highly suspicious of people who have a side business due to divided commitments.</p>

<p><strong>As soon as possible.</strong> Generally, getting your company set up legaly is one of the best ways to start safely. Also, it isn't that expensive to incorporate a company.</p>
