<p>An investor I met from events called and wanted to have a brainstorming meeting. (Not sure what this is also)</p>

<p>Our product is changing directions constantly, we do not have a slide deck, we are not seeking investment at the moment and do not want to go through the "getting ready for investors" process which is ridiculously time consuming. </p>

<p>How to have a productive meeting while not actively searching for investment and not look incompetent because of having higher priorities than getting ready to pitch?</p>

<p>I would recommend not taking the investor meeting for a few reasons:</p>

<p>-It sounds like you <strong>don't have much to show</strong>. You might impress with your team but presumably you would do that later anyway when you can show a vision, product, and hopefully some traction. </p>

<p>-Any prep you do would <strong>take time away</strong> from the more important goals of market research, choosing an idea, and early development.</p>

<p>-Investors generally <strong>get more interested when a startup declines to meet</strong>. It signals you don't need them and bring more to the table than they do. It's not entirely rational but a common reaction.</p>

<p>-Some investors will ask for meetings to <strong>troll for ideas and information</strong>. The risk in your situation is lower because you haven't decided on an idea but anything you say can be used against you. I don't mean to be paranoid and generally favor being open, but recommend doing so when you have hit the ground running and can run faster than potential competitors.</p>

<p>Two alternate views are 1) that you ask for advice when you want money and want money when you want advice; 2) it's good to build relationships before you ask for money. I think these have merit but that the downsides above generally outweigh the potential positives. </p>

<p>The bottom line is that when you have a strong team, product, and especially traction, you have the best chance to raise money.</p>

<p>A valid (in good faith!) assumption would be the investor just wants to start building a long term relationship with you. If he is serious, this is just his first step in the process of assessing his future investment. </p>

<p>You can do (without jeopardizing your current priorities) two simple things:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>kindly <strong>ask for an agenda</strong> of the meeting, preferably with some questions that he wants answered. Then you prepare some sharp answers.</p></li>
<li><p>you can informally <strong>present your long term vision</strong> (if he is a valuable potential partner, he will provide feedback) and maybe give a <strong>brief status</strong> of your current work (including an expected delivery/go-to-market scenario) which will lay the foundation of a future discussion about investment. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>A genuine partner will appreciate you are prioritizing your efforts towards your product and does not require special treatment. You are making him a favor when you are saving time for a meeting.  </p>
