I am currently in the planning stages of an online investment company. I currently live in New Zealand, a highly regulated country (for financial institutions). I was just wondering, which is the best (and cheapest) country to register my company and what costs would be associated? Is there an easy way to go about registering this kind of business?

The answer would depend on a number of factors, including the business model of the business you are trying to start. By that I mean, who are the clients and markets that you are trying to target. I would suggest that if the main premise is targeting NZ customers you would probably be best of to be based there and ensure that you comply with the local regulations.

Another consideration would be the startup ecosystem for investment startups (fintech) that would make the country appealing. Things to consider would be the size of the market for similar startups, number of VC willing to invest in that market and their risk appetite and knowledge of finteh startups. In addition, you would strongly need to consider future talent acquisition for your startup when choosing a geographical location.

With all the above in mind, some of the big global financial hubs are natural choices. They include London, New York, Singapore, Hong Kong and potentially even Shanghai. 

I have recently relocated to London to also pursue my passion of founding an investment startup and did a lot of research prior to moving here from Sydney, Australia. It is currently the biggest fintech centre in the world measured by number of new fintech startups so has a lot of potential, but again it would depend on your target market and business model.

I hope this helps.
