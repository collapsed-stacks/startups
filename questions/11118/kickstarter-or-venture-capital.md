<p>I'm starting a software project which will include hardware part later on as I progress.</p>

<p>I need some startup fund to cover additional programmers, hardware engineers and marketing need. (I'm a software dev, know nothing about hardware.)</p>

<p>Should I go with Kickstarter or VC? And why?</p>

<p>Both have merits.</p>

<p>Having angels and VCs around means you get some support in various forms in addition to money, at the cost of some - and potentially a lot of - oversight. Angels and very early stage VCs (and family/friends) are, frankly, the only ones who will fund a project at the idea stage. </p>

<p>A Kickstarter's main merit is that you're accountable to no one but your backers/clients. You can't just organize a Kickstarter though: a project's likelihood to get funded materially increases if it's in an advanced enough state that you can <em>show</em> the deliverable that your backers will get. When it's still in ideation, reputation counts <em>a lot</em>. A few tips if you try it regardless:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/4098/types-of-incentives-for-powerful-crowdfunding/">Types of incentives for powerful crowdfunding</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/5329/bootstrap-marketing-activities-before-crowdfunding/">Bootstrap Marketing Activities Before Crowdfunding</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>In practice, ideally find a cofounder or two (e.g. business, then hardware) and bootstrap the project on your own dime. There's no better backer for a project than paying users, and you should really focus on identifying (and closing) the latter before starting resource intensive developments, as they'll give you priceless insights on what your market <em>actually</em> values.</p>
