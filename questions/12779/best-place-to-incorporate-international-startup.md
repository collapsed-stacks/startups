My business partner and I are looking for a good place to incorporate our startup. We are interested in remaining flexible with regard to where we work. We don't have an office yet and will not need a physical location to do business (it's an internet business).

Ideally, the incorporation would have the following qualities:

 - No corporate taxes
 - Minimal reporting requirements
 - No physical location required
 - Ability to easily open bank accounts that support credit/debit cards
 - Ability to do business in mainstream international markets
 - Low cost / time to setup and maintain
 - Discretion and protection of officers

I have started looking into the following options:

 - Singapore
 - Hong Kong
 - British Virgin Islands
 - Belize
 - Ras Al Khaimah (RAK)

The last option (RAK -- http://formarak.com/) seems to be very attractive. Can someone comment on these options, things to consider, and other alternatives?

Also check out Panama (flat rate tax without needing to file anything, but you'll be looked at as if you're incorporated in Nigeria) and Malta (small tax after some paperwork on top of a mandatory yearly audit, but with the benefit of being EU-/Eurozone-based in an English-speaking country).

There's a huge _but_, however. Namely, it's only sane to do if you and your partners are all perpetual travelers and not US citizens (which pay taxes in when living abroad)... If you don't tick both boxes, the only sane places to incorporate are one of the founders' country of residence.

Don't forget the ease of getting a merchant account and its associated costs in your calculations. Research it before picking a country, else you might discover that you need to pay thousands of bucks per month and carry a huge balance to be able to process credit cards.
