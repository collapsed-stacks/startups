<p>Im developing a Web+iOS app called <strong>Newtonian</strong>,yet I am very confused in which direction I should proceed in.First of all,I need some back-end devs up with me to develop the app,yet I have no contacts.Also,besides hiring the right people,Newtonian also needs lots of professional equipment(think Radon Gas detectors,Seismometers),etc.What should I do?</p>

<p>You should go ahead if one or more are true:</p>

<ul>
<li>you have a problem and the only viable way to solve it is founding a startup</li>
<li>you got some paying customers willing to pay enough, pay NOW and wait while you develop the product</li>
<li>you have the time, capital and the will to gamble 1000:1 on your idea</li>
</ul>
