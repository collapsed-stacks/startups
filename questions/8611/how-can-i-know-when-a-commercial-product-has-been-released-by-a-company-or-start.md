<p>I want to get information about a company (a s.p.a. which develops optimization solutions, specialized in research and development of engineering software) and also about one of the products it has developed and sells (a multi-objective optimization and design environment) and I want to find out which is the first release date, at least the year when this company proposed its product for the first time. </p>

<p>(Just to be clear: what I'm looking for is a database like those provided by Whois for people who are looking for informations about name domains, through which it's possible to know when the domain was registered. I'm looking for a similar database with regard to startups and companies)</p>

<p><em>- is there any <strong>database</strong> available online which provides <strong>information</strong> about the <strong>companies</strong> and / or the products they sell, providing also the dates of launch?</em> </p>

<p>Groups don't have to declare that they're about to start a company or launch a product.  It's all about what they CHOOSE to disclose.</p>

<p>Crunchbase is one of many databases that aggregate company information.  If you change the filter to companies founded after 2015, you can get some information about new startups [that have disclosed information about their plans]:</p>

<p>Here's another company that follows high-potential startups:</p>
