I want to get information about a company (a s.p.a. which develops optimization solutions, specialized in research and development of engineering software) and also about one of the products it has developed and sells (a multi-objective optimization and design environment) and I want to find out which is the first release date, at least the year when this company proposed its product for the first time. 

(Just to be clear: what I'm looking for is a database like those provided by Whois for people who are looking for informations about name domains, through which it's possible to know when the domain was registered. I'm looking for a similar database with regard to startups and companies)

*- is there any **database** available online which provides **information** about the **companies** and / or the products they sell, providing also the dates of launch?*

Groups don't have to declare that they're about to start a company or launch a product.  It's all about what they CHOOSE to disclose.

Crunchbase is one of many databases that aggregate company information.  If you change the filter to companies founded after 2015, you can get some information about new startups [that have disclosed information about their plans]:

Here's another company that follows high-potential startups:
