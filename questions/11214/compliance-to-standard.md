I am writing a document management application.  

There is an interchangeability standard called [CMIS][1]   

Compliance with the standard would double my work.  It would add little if any value.   

How can I measure market sensitivity to implementing the standard.  Most of the big play implement that standard.  One only implements the minimum on of their products but they were one of the 4 companies that came together to initiate the standard the are pretty much required to implement in name.

Use search keyword analysis to measure market sensitivity. For example, when consumers care about HIPAA compliance, they search for 

 - hipaa compliant email
 - hipaa compliant cloud storage
 - hipaa compliant video conferencing 

What percentage of the total market searches for "hipaa compliant video conferencing" vs those that simply search for "video conferencing"? 

Does anyone search for "cmis compliant document management?" If not, then it's unlikely you will gain any advantage in initial traction. As you said, little to no benefit. It seems like it may be best saved for a later iteration of the project.
