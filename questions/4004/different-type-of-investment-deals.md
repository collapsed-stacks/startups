<ol>
<li><p>$100k at $5 million pre-money.</p>

<p>Your company is worth $5M you take $100k now your company is worth $5.1M</p>

<ul>
<li>Investor owns 1.96% ($100k at $5.1M valuation)</li>
<li>You own 98.04% </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>$100k at a $5 million cap.</p>

<p>You &amp; the investor don't know the value of the company. So the investment doesn't have a % specified yet and the % will be specified on your next round of investment.</p>

<p>You get $100k(seed) from investor A at a valuation X which will be determined later.
If you work meh for 10 months and get series A from investor B $200k at a valuation of $3M.</p>

<ul>
<li>Investor A will own 3.33% ($100k at $3M valuation)</li>
<li>Investor B will own 6.66% ($200k at $3M valuation)</li>
<li>You will own 90%</li>
</ul>

<p>If you work really well and get series A from investor B $1M at a valuation of $10M (you have gone over your cap $5M)</p>

<ul>
<li>Investor A will own 2% ($100k at $5M valuation)</li>
<li>Investor B will own 10% ($1M at $10M valuation)</li>
<li>You will own 88% </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>$100k uncapped</p>

<p>You get $100k from investor A, work for sometime. When you get series A for $900k for $10M valuation.</p>

<ul>
<li>Investor A will own 1% ($100k at $10M valuation)</li>
<li>Investor B will own 9% ($900k at $10M valuation)</li>
<li>You will own 90%</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>$100k uncapped with a %10 discount.</p>

<p>You get $100k from investor A, work for sometime. When you get series A for $900k for $10M valuation.</p>

<ul>
<li>Investor A will own 1.11% ($100k at $9M valuation)    </li>
<li>Investor B will own 9% ($900K at $10M valuation) </li>
<li>You will own 89.89%</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
