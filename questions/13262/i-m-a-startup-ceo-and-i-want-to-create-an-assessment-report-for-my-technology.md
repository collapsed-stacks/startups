<p>Using an outside service to assess software quality seems like a huge waste of time and money.</p>

<p>In my view, software quality is defined by the testing code that tests your software (e.g., unit tests). Figure out the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage" rel="nofollow noreferrer">code coverage</a> of your tests and that is a good measure of your software quality.</p>

<p>If you don't have testing code, then you have an unmaintainable mess and it will be hard to commercialize.</p>

<p>What you are looking for is called Software audit review. It is usually performed by external party, not a direct member of whoever is developing the software.</p>

<p>It can be either an auditor firm, another software firm, or an outside consultant. If the results are for your own, internal consumption, outside firm or consultant is the way to go.</p>

<p>There are certain cases where audit review is required by customers, quite often government agencies. In those cases, only a certified auditor can perform this review and those services are very, very expensive.</p>
