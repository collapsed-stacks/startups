Kind of related to: https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/236/how-should-i-test-my-product, the difference is I wish to pay testers to come test my product. The premise goes as follows:

I have launched a brilliant software as a service product that will improve your life if you will follow its recommendations.

Unfortunately not everyone agrees with my brilliant vision and so far not many people have signed up.

I believe that if I actually got people using the product, I could measure their improvement in life and build a case study, therefore making my product more attractive to future signups.

But since I have no users, I would like to __pay__ people to do a product trial.

How would I go about doing this? Are there sites like freelancer.com.au and odesk.com which supply product testers? The freelancing framework is attractive as I would like to pay $x per hour.

Are there alternative ways to generate lots of testers in a short time period, say a fortnight?

I have never found it difficult to pay people to do something seemingly simple. I'm not entirely sure if your "life changing" software requires that users use the product consistently for a lengthy period of time (diet or exercise plan for example), but regardless I think reaching out to everybody you come into contact with and actively selling the product (or offering to pay people to use it) would work best.

If you need people that need to keep in contact with you for reporting physical outcomes (something you can't quantify digitally) then perhaps start by forcing your entire family and friends network to use it. If the results are satisfying then they would likely help build your user base.

This sounds like a marketing issue. You may want to consider hiring a professional or learn how to get your product into the hands of more people on your own. People won't look you up if they don't know you exist.

But I would suggest that if you plan to spend money to get users you would be better served spending that money on advertising than purchasing users.
