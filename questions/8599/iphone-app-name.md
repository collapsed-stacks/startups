<p>My app will be fully developed in April not taking into account which bugs will be found on the way. I am starting to advertise and create a fan following on Facebook under the company's name and not the actual app name. The app name would be more attractive when marketing online and in-person rather than they long company name. </p>

<p>The idea is to launch on the iphone platform than on the android. I don't want someone else to steal the name for something else or for a different platform. </p>

<p>Should I worry about that or just start using the actual app name for pre launch marketing?</p>

<p>Let me know what everyone thinks. </p>

<p>Why not do as they suggest in this post from the other day?</p>

<p><a href="https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/8571/can-i-register-the-name-of-an-app-before-starting-creating-it">Can I register the name of an app before starting creating it?</a></p>

<p>In this post, they suggest you simply create a "hello world" app with your app name in the android store while you flush out the actual app.  Make a cool COMING SOON animation and people will download it an salivate waiting for your real app to arrive.</p>

<p>You could even turn that process on its head, and REWARD people who download the "coming soon" app with some kind of in-game bonus when the real game arrives.</p>
