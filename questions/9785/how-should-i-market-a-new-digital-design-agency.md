<p>I have spent that last few years stuck in IT, before that I was heavily involved in web &amp; graphic design but as I have no RECENT experience I have found it nearly impossible to get a job back in design. </p>

<p>So I'm going to have to go solo and startup on my own.</p>

<p>This will have to be a "lean" startup as I don't have the funds to throw at posh premises or fancy marketing, however I do already have ALL of the required equipment, software etc - so will be working from home. 
I have yet to design my own brand / web / social media stuff - I finish my current contract next month so am just preparing to get fully on this.</p>

<p>Being UK based - What are my best options for getting the word out there and getting some work in to help build my portfolio?</p>

<p>I think, but may be wrong, that local "networking" events may be my No.1 cheap option to get noticed.</p>

<p>ETA: I have just ordered an actual PILE of books on design startups &amp; agency stuff.</p>

<p>You're 100% spot on. Go to meetup events and similar. In particular, go there as a speaker in marketing, web design, UX, and small &amp; medium business related groups. Do a quick talk on this or that topic - your choice which one, but make it interesting and useful to your audience. Display your expertise. You'll get clients and referrals before you know it.</p>

<p>Once you have a few good references, continue doing these meetups with a twist: try to bring one or two of them along. <em>Nothing</em> sells better than a happy client enthusiastically explaining how great a job you did to prospects.</p>
