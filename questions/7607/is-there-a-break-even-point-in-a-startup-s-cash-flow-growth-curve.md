In the Cash-Flow curve of a startup(acquisition phase), is there a break-even point?

[![enter image description here][1]][1]


Is there a point which stands for an optimal number of customers per month?  Or should it be decided solely on the investment available?

Larger the number of customers, the trough would be deeper, but still the growth curve would be much steeper(assuming constant retention).  But, is there a point in the trough which says "**enough acquisition**"?

<p>After a nice <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/3pgjsd/is_there_a_breakeven_point_in_a_startups_cash/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">discussion</a> and from @Mruf's <a href="https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/7607/is-there-a-break-even-point-in-a-startups-cash-flow-growth-curve/7615#comment6577_7607">comment</a>, I seem to have the answer.</p>

<p>The break even point is just the point when your cash flow exactly equals the expenses(costs) of the company.</p>

<p>Yes indeed, it is solely decided by the investment available. So, the trough's depth is directly dependent on the investment available with the company.</p>
