<p>I am considering to start up an electronics subsystems supply company. In order to proceed further, I am trying to find out products which I could develop and sell online as modules as well as to product manufacturers which could directly use the products as part of their systems on a modular level. </p>

<p>I have come across many products - like RF &amp; WiFi Modules, Motor Controller, Motor Drives, Power Converters, etc. </p>

<p>I would need some help in order to understand if there is a specific way I should proceed further. Also, I am a little confused as to which product I should start with - I have tried to find out which companies are selling similar products. </p>

<p>I would appreciate some strategy to proceed further in this direction. </p>
