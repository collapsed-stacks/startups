According to [this wall street journal][1] article, mark zuckerburg has 57% voting rights although he has only 28% of super voting stock.

Can someone explain how this works. Here is the snippet from that article?

> Zuckerberg only owns about 28% of those super-voting Class B shares,
> so where does his control come from? He has voting agreements with
> many of his fellow shareholders that give him a proxy to vote enough
> additional shares to give him voting rights to a total of around 57%
> of the super-voting stock, the S1 shows. More than enough to give him
> control over the company.

As mentioned in the short paragraph you gave us, he has voting agreements with enough shareholders to reach that 57% mark. He agreed with them that they will be voting as he wishes, but I could not find a source showing off typical agreements. It is possible that they were allowed to buy those shares to a lower price or something along those lines.
