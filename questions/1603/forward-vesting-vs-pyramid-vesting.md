Whats the difference between forward vesting and pyramid vesting?  
Which one should an early startups and a late stage startups use and why?


This question is based on ["How to Start a Startup" - Lecture 20: Later-Stage Advice][1], by Sam Altman; following is the excerpted from the [video presentation][2]:

<p><strong>Forward Vesting</strong></p>

<p>The stock options/shares you grant are given in increments over a period of time. Typical arrangement for an early stage startup may see a 4 year vesting period with 1 year cliff.
During the first year of cliff none of the stock options/shares are granted. This is done to prevent someone who hasn't worked for a minimum of one year from getting any equity. After the cliff the stock may vest monthly/yearly depending on a pre arranged schedule.</p>

<p><strong>Pyramid Vesting</strong></p>

<p>In this case you give more stock options/shares the longer the person stays in the company.
So for the typical 4 year vesting period, in year 1 you may not get any stock (cliff), in year 2 some of the stock options/shares will vest, in year 3 the you will get more than year 2 but less than year 1, and in year 4 you will get most of the stock. So the grants are made like a pyramid with most of the shares vesting in the last year. </p>

<p>e.g. If you are awarded 10000 stock options in forward vesting they may vest as following: End of Year 1 - 2500, Year 2 - 2500, Year 3 - 2500 and Year 4 - 2500. While, in pyramid vesting they may vest as the following: End of Year 1 - 1000, Year 2 - 2000, Year 3 - 3000 and Year 4 - 4000.  </p>

<p>Given the difference in the vesting schedule, <em>Pyramid Vesting</em> incentivizes employees to stick around longer. However, <em>Forward Vesting</em> is much simpler to understand and gives the same increment of stock every year so employees may prefer it. With <em>Forward Vesting</em> it is  much easier to estimate the value of the stock options while the company undergoes different stages of funding.</p>

<p>I do not think you need a different vesting schedule for early-stage v/s late-stage startups. Since for most larger companies (Google, Microsoft, IBM etc.) forward vesting of employee stock options is the norm, I assume that the only place where a pyramid vesting schedule can work is in an early-stage startup. Eventually, you may have to move to forward vesting if you are around longer. </p>

<p>These issues were also briefly touched upon in Sam Altman's lecture on "<a href="http://startupclass.samaltman.com/courses/lec20/" rel="nofollow">Later-Stage Advice</a>"
as part of the <a href="http://startupclass.samaltman.com/" rel="nofollow">CS183b — How to Start a Startup class</a>. His advice was also along the lines that no matter which how you decide to vest the stock options you need to put in place an option management system to be able to track options allocated to employees. </p>

<p><strong>Refresher Grants</strong></p>

<p>Since there was a comment about refresher grants I am adding some details here.
With the initial employee offer the stock options that are granted may be supplemented over the years based on good performance. These additional grants are called refresher grants. These grants can vest in the same way as the original ones following either <em>Forward Vesting</em> or <em>Pyramid Vesting</em>. It is a good idea to give refresher grants so that after the end of the initial vesting period the employee still has incentive to continue working for the company. </p>
