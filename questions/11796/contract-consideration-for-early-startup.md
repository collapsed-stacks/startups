I have been working in a small startup company in Portugal as PHP developer (key employee) and currently I am in the process to negotiate a deal and become minor co-owner of the company. The deal has a vesting period, where I commit further years in the company in exchange of some percentage.

I am now collecting some ideas for negotiating a fair vesting contract for both parties at the same time I need to protect my interests in the deal.
Below I describe some few points I would like to have written in the contract, I would like to know your opinion on:

- If I missed out some key points to be negotiated.
- If you think my request are fair.

I am completely aware I should consult a lawyer because of Portugal law, but I would appreciate your general feedback.

Here points to be included:

 1. As an employee I lose only non-vested shares if I leave by my own or
    I am being fired with a valid cause. If the company dismiss me for
    any other reasons, I receive all shares intact.

 2. In case of a temporary disability to work for major causes, the vesting period will be prolonged.
 3. In case the company reduce my latest salary agreed, 100% vesting will occur immediately.
 4. “Full acceleration on exit”

I would completely agree on point 2 and 4. I think your third point is not to the benefit of the company. Assume the startup isn't making as much money as expected and salaries have to be cut for a while. If 100% vesting occurs immediately, the company/shareholders risk you taking all the money out right away at an already difficult time where money is tight.

<p>In general, I advocate you negotiating work in exchange for <em>shares</em> of stock instead of <em>percentages</em>. <a href="https://startups.stackexchange.com/a/11814/5273">This answer explains the concept in greater detail</a>.</p>
