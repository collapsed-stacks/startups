<p>I have been working in a small startup company in Portugal as PHP developer (key employee) and currently I am in the process to negotiate a deal and become minor co-owner of the company. The deal has a vesting period, where I commit further years in the company in exchange of some percentage.</p>

<p>I am now collecting some ideas for negotiating a fair vesting contract for both parties at the same time I need to protect my interests in the deal.
Below I describe some few points I would like to have written in the contract, I would like to know your opinion on:</p>

<ul>
<li>If I missed out some key points to be negotiated.</li>
<li>If you think my request are fair.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am completely aware I should consult a lawyer because of Portugal law, but I would appreciate your general feedback.</p>

<p>Here points to be included:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>As an employee I lose only non-vested shares if I leave by my own or
I am being fired with a valid cause. If the company dismiss me for
any other reasons, I receive all shares intact.</p></li>
<li><p>In case of a temporary disability to work for major causes, the vesting period will be prolonged.</p></li>
<li>In case the company reduce my latest salary agreed, 100% vesting will occur immediately.</li>
<li>“Full acceleration on exit”</li>
</ol>

<p>I would completely agree on point 2 and 4. I think your third point is not to the benefit of the company. Assume the startup isn't making as much money as expected and salaries have to be cut for a while. If 100% vesting occurs immediately, the company/shareholders risk you taking all the money out right away at an already difficult time where money is tight.</p>

<p>In general, I advocate you negotiating work in exchange for <em>shares</em> of stock instead of <em>percentages</em>. <a href="https://startups.stackexchange.com/a/11814/5273">This answer explains the concept in greater detail</a>.</p>
