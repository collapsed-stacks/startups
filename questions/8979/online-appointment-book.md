I need multiple people to be able to log in and enter appointments into my schedule.
I'd like to be able to customise the information that is required for an appointment such as 'client name', 'contact number' and 'address', etc.
I need to be able to view my schedule on my phone.

It would be good for the future if I could have multiple practitioners on the same schedule, working simultaneously. So to enter an appointment you select the practitioner so that it checks that the practitioner is not busy.

Do you know of an app that will do all of this?
I saw a browser based one but I don't know what it was.
Is there a free one?

One excellent choice would be to setup your own website running Wordpress as a CMS (content management system) and add a booking plugin.

To do this, you would:

 1. get a shared hosting plan (<$10 month depending on the plan you pick from places like HostGator, DreamHost, BlueHost, WestHost, etc...)
 2. install Wordpress
 3. choose a free or paid theme that you like and install it
 4. install a booking plugin (for free-and-open-source plugins, search the Wordpress plugin repository ... when selecting a plugin, make sure you look at when the plugin was last updated, and how many active installs it has - I only install if >1000 installs, and <1 yr since last update)

This isn't the 'quickest', as in punch-a-button-and-install-it-in-5-minutes, solution, but it is fairly straightforward, and probably one of the least expensive and most scalable solutions long-term. You can also install an ecommerce plugin (e.g. WooCommerce) and use it to handle online payments, bills, etc. Because you would have a website with a very capable CMS, you could also add most features that would be useful - media galleries, staff information, practice information, FAQ, form downloads, etc.

Of course, there are also other similar CMS options like Joomla, Drupal, etc - but WordPress is typically easier to get used to straight off.

MS Outlook allows you to share calendars with specific users. The appointment tool also allows for you see the calendar availability of other attendees to the appointment.
