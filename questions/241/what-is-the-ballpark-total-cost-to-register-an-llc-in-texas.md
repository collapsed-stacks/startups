I found information about [filing fees](http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/texas-form-llc-31745.html) that indicates it would cost $340 to file in Texas.

However, that's not the full cost, as a lawyer is necessary to draft a basic [operating agreement](http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/llc-operating-agreement-30232.html) and there may be other fees I'm unaware of.

What would be a rough estimate of the cost for registering an LLC in the state of Texas (i.e. $340 + lawyer + unknown fees)?

The main registration costs you will face are initial filing fees, lawyer fees and registered agent fees. It's impossible to give a decent an estimate on how much it will cost for you without having specific details on your needs. It's entirely possible that your startup could be registered for less than $340 though.

The initial filing fees are the only thing you really can't go without. It costs $300 in Texas and may be more or less in other states. 

You may want to reserve the name of your LLC which costs $40 in Texas. This is only necessary if you need to reserve it before registering your LLC. You automatically claim a name if it's available when you register your LLC. You can easily save $40 here by not filing extra paperwork.

Paying a lawyer to draft an Operating Agreement is nearly impossible to estimate since the costs of lawyers varies and depends on how complex your agreement needs to be. This document dictates how your LLC governs itself and can be written up by your co-founders. There are plenty of templates and articles about Operating Agreements out there you can work with. Lawyers get expensive very quickly, so I'd advise against paying for them here unless you really need it.

All Texas LLCs require a registered agent. This can be a corporation or Texas resident (you can designate yourself, assuming you live in the state.) If you want to pay for a registered agent service, some of them offer the first year for free after which the price jumps to around $100/ year.

Personally, I'd recommend taking the cheap options, unless you have a special need. If that works for you, it comes out to $300 to register an LLC in Texas.
