The following question is connected to the Stackoverflow following discussion. I read the discussion and believed in the accepted answer, but after contacting the Licensor (Wrapbootstrap), I understood that the answer was wrong.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20902957/wrapbootstrap-templates-license-explained

This was my question to Wrapbootstrap:

>I want to build a commercial project. Commercial Projects are allowed with your Single Application License as stated in your license? 

This is the sentence in WrapBootstrap License talking about the Commercial Usage with Single Application License. This issue is not only related to WrapBootstrap but also to many other websites like (Envato Market, Bootstrap Made and others..):

>this license grants you a non-exclusive and non-transferable right to use and incorporate the item in your personal or commercial projects.

The definition of commercial usage is having a profit from the website. Website can have profit through **Advertisement, monthly fee, subscriptions, donations and others..**

This type of website are also defined from others as Software as a Service.

This is the definition of commercial usage within creative commons.

This problem is about Licensing and It is common to millions of developers that uses Standard Layout for their Software Applications. This is just a practical case that I am describing and can be found in many other marketplaces:

Luckily the question has already an answer and I would like to make a clear post online for the other developers

>**themicon** SELLER

>Hello, license difference themselves on the purpose of the project. Single license is for a project that is created for one client only. Multiple is the same like Single, but support many project for one client each one. Then, Extended license is the only one that allows to create a project that can be re-selled as a stock product or pay per use service (saas).
The part "personal or commercial projects" seems to refer that you can use the project for something that you need for yourself or a project that you are building because a client ask you for that (commercial).
We don't write license terms, they were created by the marketplace owner. If the terms sound confusing you can contact Wrapbootstrap support for a clarification.

>Let us know if you have any question
>Regards 

The Single Application License cost 18 Dollars while an Extended License costs between 600 and 900 $. For this reason I can not take in consideration for my project this templates.

This is the definition of commercial usage within creative commons.

Some alternatives:

I found this github repository that includes the a free templates, which have MIT License:

https://github.com/puikinsh/gentelella

MIT License will be the best you can get for a project, then you will need to make sure all the details and ask the provider of the license.

The github repository includes links to other webpages where templates are listed, be very careful and do not download anything without reading the license. Sometimes are included direct download, if you check the link your can find the github page and read the license information.
