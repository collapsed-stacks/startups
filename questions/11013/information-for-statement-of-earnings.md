<p>In Ontario, Canada, what information must be on a Statement of Earnings? I work as an independent contractor for a company, and thus receive money weekly as well as don't sell goods. I know that the CRA has a template somewhere on their website, but is it mandatory to follow it? I don't see the need to include cash sales, credit sales, sales returns, total sales etc. as I'm paid weekly.</p>
