I am a developer, how can I get a parttime or fulltime remote job? I have more than 10 years experience with software development. My skills very well in:
- Java: primefaces, jsf, spring, spring, jpa, hibernate. Openfire(xmpp chat system), xml
- Php: yii framework.
- front end: vuejs, jquery, minifiedjs, HTML, xhtml, json.

My English enough to work but not enough to pass interview. Any body give me some idea?

You need to take a look at sites like UpWork.com, FreeLancer.com, and Guru.com.  There you can post a listing for yourself and bid on freelance jobs with companies and individuals around the world.  It isn't an easy market to get into, because there's a tremendous amount of competition, but those sites will give you a better idea of how to go about it.

I hope this helps.

Good luck!
