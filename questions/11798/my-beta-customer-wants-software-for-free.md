<p>Our company is running a SASS business.</p>

<p>We asked an early beta customer to start paying us.  We give all users a 30 day free trial, but this user feels that he is entitled to free software since he helped with bug testing and initial feature requests.  </p>

<p>We've implemented many of his initial ideas and he's getting a lot of value out of those.</p>

<p>How do we convince this customer that he should start paying without causing bad feelings.</p>

<p>Depending on the initial agreement, and the market you're in, your beta customer may have a point.</p>

<p><strong>Look at it from his side</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>he took a risk on your company instead of an established company</li>
<li>he has gone through the pain / problems / etc of all your bug testing</li>
<li>those initial features that you added 'for him' were features that were lacking that he might have been able to get elsewhere (depends on your service)</li>
<li>it's largely irrelevant that he chose to beta-test at least partially to save money - what else would motivate him to take the risk?</li>
<li>people want to feel like part of the original team - they typically don't like getting relegated back to being a 'normal user'</li>
<li>Also, consider that it may just be a good thing to keep a motivated 'customer' that continually adds feedback &amp; bug tests new releases. Giving them free access to your software is pretty cheap in return</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Show him your side &amp; make it mutually beneficial</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>he probably isn't thinking about your costs for server space, etc.</li>
<li>maybe you can make an offer, where he pays a small fee to cover your actual operating costs, less labor, etc.</li>
<li>perhaps engage him in marketing - in exchange for telling his network about it, doing a case study with him, etc</li>
<li>make a more formal agreement - he gets a super deal, in exchange for actual agreement to test your new features, participate in user feedback sessions, sit on a user review board, etc</li>
<li>in other words, can you find a solution where he helps you out in at least somewhat defined ways, to not only test but market, in exchange for free/at-cost rates for him? This could convert a potentially upset initial client to a significant asset to your company.</li>
</ul>
