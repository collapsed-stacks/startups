We have registered company Blabla LLC in Maryland, and obtained an EIN from IRS website. For this company, we have also filed a DBA name (say AWESOME COMPANY ). Now, for opening a bank account for the AWESOME COMPANY,  should we use the EIN for the Blabla LLC or, should we apply for a new EIN number for the AWESOME COMPANY?

If we should get a new EIN, what is the structure of business we should choose for this DBA? LLC ?

Thanks

DBA is an alias, it is not a separate entity. You do not (and cannot) get a new EIN for each DBA. You can setup as many aliases (DBA) as you want, but the underlying entity remains one and the same, and is reported using the same EIN.

You go to the bank with the DBA registration to show them that checks made out to "AWESOME COMPANY" can be cashed by "Blabla LLC" since the "AWESOME COMPANY" is the alias for "Blabla LLC". Then the bank will open the account for "Blabla LLC" and will accept checks to "AWESOME COMPANY" to be deposited to that account and allow you printing "AWESOME COMPANY" on checks drawn on that account.

When you identify your company to your payors and partners using W9 - you write down your company's official name (Blabla LLC), its EIN **and**, *on a separate line*, the DBA alias.
