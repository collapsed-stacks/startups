Getting a patent can be a very long, complicated, and technical process. I would recommend researching patent attorney's who have experience working in your specific area of focus.

Now if you just have an idea that you want to protect, I would recommend obtaining a provisional patent. You can file them on line for about a hundred dollars, and it will protect your idea for one year.
