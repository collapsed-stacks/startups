<p>I just registered my Delaware C Corp.</p>

<p>Everywhere they advise to buy my shares using a cheque and keep the photocopy in my files. ($34.40 total)
The issue is, I live in China and 1-My bank doesn't emit cheques 2-Even if it did, they would be in Yuan, not USD.</p>

<p>I am not a US citizen, creating a bank account in the US will be problematic.</p>

<p>Would a wire transfer suffice ? What should I keep ?</p>

<p>Is Western union a good option ?</p>

<p>They advise for checks because in the USA that is the preferred method. However that doesn't mean that you cannot use an alternative method like wire transfer or western union.</p>

<p>Whatever you choose to do you'll get a document from your bank for the transaction with all the necessary details and that is what you need to keep.</p>

<p>I recommend wire transfer since western union has some really high fees.</p>
