I just registered my Delaware C Corp.

Everywhere they advise to buy my shares using a cheque and keep the photocopy in my files. ($34.40 total)
The issue is, I live in China and 1-My bank doesn't emit cheques 2-Even if it did, they would be in Yuan, not USD.

I am not a US citizen, creating a bank account in the US will be problematic.

Would a wire transfer suffice ? What should I keep ?

Is Western union a good option ?

They advise for checks because in the USA that is the preferred method. However that doesn't mean that you cannot use an alternative method like wire transfer or western union.

Whatever you choose to do you'll get a document from your bank for the transaction with all the necessary details and that is what you need to keep.

I recommend wire transfer since western union has some really high fees.
