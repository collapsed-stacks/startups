Currently I am the state of Texas, and I was wondering is it illegal to file as a C-Corporation in another state that has better Tax Breaks?

<p>It's not illegal. In fact it's the norm. <a href="http://technical.ly/delaware/2014/09/23/why-delaware-incorporation/" rel="nofollow">64% of the Fortune 500 were formed in Delware</a> due to its business friendly climate. Delaware also happens to be the smallest state.</p>

<p>That being said, filing in another state does not mean you don't have to file taxes in your home state or any other state in which you have a physical presence. A corporation must file in every state in which it has <a href="http://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/taxes/what-is-nexus-and-how-does-it-affect-your-small-business/" rel="nofollow">nexus</a>, regardless of which state the corporation is formed in. If you own a corporation in another state but continue to work for the corporation in Texas, you must file in Texas.</p>

<p>There are some additional steps you should be aware of before you start doing business. You should speak to a qualified attorney and accountant to get complete advice on your personal situation.</p>
