I'm developing News aggregator site, similar to Msn, but there's an issue: where do I find content for it?

The first idea I have is to aggregate from RSS feeds, but it contains the only link to the original resource without it's content itself. So I'm forced to redirect my users to a foreign resource but it's not cool. At first glance, it seems that the terms of the RSS feed's usage don't allow me to post full articles on my own website?

The second idea I have is to buy the commercial subscription on a full-content news feed from somewhere. Looks better, but where to get such provider?

I suggest you find a programmer who can build you a good web scraper to scrape directly from the news sites themselves. If you know programming it's not a hard thing to do and you'll easily find someone who can do it.

Secondly if you wish you can experiment with webscrapers like [Kimono](https://www.kimonolabs.com/) or [Import.io](http://import.io/), they are tools designed to be used by non-developers.
