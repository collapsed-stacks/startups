<p>I'm developing News aggregator site, similar to Msn, but there's an issue: where do I find content for it?</p>

<p>The first idea I have is to aggregate from RSS feeds, but it contains the only link to the original resource without it's content itself. So I'm forced to redirect my users to a foreign resource but it's not cool. At first glance, it seems that the terms of the RSS feed's usage don't allow me to post full articles on my own website?</p>

<p>The second idea I have is to buy the commercial subscription on a full-content news feed from somewhere. Looks better, but where to get such provider?</p>

<p>I suggest you find a programmer who can build you a good web scraper to scrape directly from the news sites themselves. If you know programming it's not a hard thing to do and you'll easily find someone who can do it.</p>

<p>Secondly if you wish you can experiment with webscrapers like <a href="https://www.kimonolabs.com/" rel="nofollow">Kimono</a> or <a href="http://import.io/" rel="nofollow">Import.io</a>, they are tools designed to be used by non-developers.</p>
