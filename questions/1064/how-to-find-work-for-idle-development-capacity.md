<p>I know a team of developers who aren't happy being employed. They would rather instead try to manage themselves. They have a good-sized capacity and they are flexible with technology (although not extremely proficient in anything in particular). I am interested in learning the sales model - how can someone market their capacity? As there is obviously lots of money in IT right now, judging by the salaries.</p>

<p>I was thinking maybe they should pick a hot technology, produce a high quality product, make it available for free in order to gain reputation and then leverage on this reputation to advertise on google?</p>

<p>I would like to get a cut as a broker and provide consultancy (design, project management) to the development team if they need my experience to explain the requirements to them. </p>

<p>Or maybe there are better ways?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>'Generalists' are very hard to sell. Don't try to sell their skills as jack of all trades, or even just Java/C++/Python developers. You'd be forcing yourself to compete against a bigger field, including off-shore development, and small Elance teams.</p>

<p>So first: Pick an industry or specific <em>problem</em> you solve. A bit of market research goes a long way. Then build some reputation in that area. A simple free tool or online service is a great way to do this.</p>

<p>The second: Sell yourself as much as you sell the team! You, DrawDomax. If you're there to scope projects, manage the team, build the relationship with the customer, you're adding a lot of value and reassurance that the customer wouldn't get from an off-shore development team.</p>

<p>Generally, someone in your position is better off sub-contracting small well defined projects from larger consultants. </p>

<p>As such, best approach would be to contact the sales &amp; project management leads of these consulting companies to see if they outsource work.</p>
