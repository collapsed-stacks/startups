I'm trying to decide whether to to incorporate my company as a C-Corp or an S-Corp. I've got a very successful iOS app bringing in substantial revenue already, and I'd like to start hiring a few other developers to expand the app and develop a sequel. It sounds like a C-Corp is what I'm aiming for in the long term, but an S-Corp sounds more ideal in the short term. 

It's been implied to me that it's possible to start as an S-Corp for a while, and then become a C-Corp if and when we start looking for investors. 

I'm wondering, what are the consequences of such a move? Upon converting the S to a C, would it work exactly as if it had been a C-Corp all along? Or would there be some lasting impact, positive or negative, from having spent some time as an S-Corp?

<p>This was something briefly covered a few months ago in another post:</p>

<p><a href="https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/9580/tax-consequences-of-starting-as-an-llc-and-converting-to-c-corp-later">tax consequences of starting as an LLC and converting to C-corp later</a></p>

<p>It would be good for you to read the article the OP included in his post, which was here:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/converting-llc-corporation-s-corporation.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Converting to a C Coorporation</a></p>

<p>Hopefully you'll find this useful, but the fact is, you can still seek out investors with a S-corporation under the JOBS act, which substantially loosened the rules for selling securities to investors without having to go through the registration process.</p>

First and foremost, all corporations start and technically stay a C-Corp for initially incorporated. After your incorporate as a C-Corp you then have the option to elect to be taxed as an S-Corp for tax purposes.

S-Corps are traditionally better for any early stage company. They can be converted to a C-Corp at any time voluntarily. That said, you may involuntarily be changed to a C-Corp if you violate any of the covenants you must abide by to remain taxed as a S-Corp (you can google S-Corp IRS to obtain the list).

If you voluntarily change from an S-Corp to a C-Corp, it is normally by the direction of new investment money (Venture Capital will not invest in S-Corp 99% of the time). There are no serious consequences tax wise.
