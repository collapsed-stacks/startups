For some-time I have had the idea of creating a web based reservation system for reserving flight tickets.

(It's out there, I know, but my plan is domestic to where I live).

To the point, how can I get discounts from airlines for reselling tickets? What are their basic requirements?

I have experience in web and system development, so I would rather build something I'm comfortable with.

You want to find out how to get discounts from airlines? Make yourself a business card with a title like, "Holiday Planning Consultant." Make up a super simple website. Then contact one of the domestic airlines you're targeting and say you are looking at adding a full travel agency service next year...
