<p>I'm looking to file a trademark in the US for my mobile/web app (It's an app for construction professionals, such as plumbers, electricians, dry wall installers, etc).</p>

<p>What class should I use in this case?</p>

<p>Downloadable mobile apps are in international class 9. That's all you need if it's a fully offline app. If there's a service component to it, like if it talks to your servers, then you will probably want to also register in one of the services classes (35-45). Which one will depend on what your service does.
