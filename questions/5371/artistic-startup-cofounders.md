<p>I am starting a games (board/card/miniatures, not video) company but am struggling with the artwork required for such things (much of the physical products I plan to make will be artistic). </p>

<p>What is a good way to meet artists of this nature to be cofounders or partners with?</p>

<p>Ideally look for someone local, as it's not easy to work with a remote graphic designer. Try design-oriented groups in your area on meetup.com. Also try the local university: students tend to be more flexible than experienced designers when it comes to working for equity.</p>

<p>If you still want to try it online, there are lots of portfolio sites around the web, e.g. behance.net or dribbble.com, and just as many remote work related sites, e.g. elance.com or freelancer.com.</p>

<p>The difficulty, IMO, is going to be finding good designers and artists who are willing to do the lion's share of the work on the hopes that someday they will be paid. So you either have to find someone who will share your dream or you will have to invest in some artwork.</p>

<p>I would look for people in the (board/card/miniature) gaming community - a local convention, or meetup.</p>

<p>I've also found Deviantart has a forum where people can post freelance jobs specifying pay and requirements. This seems like it may be useful for one off pieces but may also be a great place to find a cofounder.</p>
