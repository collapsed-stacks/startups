<p>I'm an individual with software engineer background and have an idea of developing a product. It's my belief that the product would address practical needs in a different way than similar products. Some company/individual could take the benefit of that.</p>

<p>So I'm thinking of developing this product myself however I don't think I could sell as an out of box product within a few months time because it just wouldn't compete with similar products. I would forecast years of development time for that.</p>

<p>However, certain parts of the product could be used as standalone tools. And those tools would be beneficial for companies. I could develop these tools in relatively short time. They could integrate into their framework or even into their products.</p>

<p>Actually, I'm looking for a company to support the development of this product and in return I'd provide them with the standalone tools and help them integrating it into their product/framework. Additionally, I'd consider prioritizing the development of the product according to what features they would like to see in those standalone tools. However, I fully want to own the code including whatever feature they asked and I implemented and so ultimately develop an out of box product.</p>

<p>Since I'm with technical background and without business experience I'm wondering how to put this into a "Business Proposal". I'd expect them to come back to me saying once I developed the product they consider taking a look and potentially buy. This is not what I'm after. What I'm looking for is a partnership and a little monetary support. I'm saying little because actually I have the money to develop the product myself in few years it's just I want their support,  feedback, and to keep in touch with company till I could hire other people to full-time work on the product. I'm sure they would benefit partnership because I could prioritize to add features that competitors haven't yet implemented (or they not even thought about it).</p>

<p>The work also involves research and documentation that I'd of course provide them and they could use that to implement their own solution.</p>

<p>How this could be put into a proposal considering (as far as I think) it's an uncommon situation?</p>

<p>TL;DR I have a business idea. Few years to develop out of box product. I want other company to support the development of product. In return I'd provide them with code/research materials and help them with integration. Ultimate goal to keep ownership of all code and release an out of box product. How to propose this to them?</p>
