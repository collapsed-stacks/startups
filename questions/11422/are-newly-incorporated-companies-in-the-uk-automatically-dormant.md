**The title above is the basic question I want answering.**

I have a company that has never traded since it was initially created, and won't be trading for at least another three months. However, I was on the Government's website and they had a bit of a contradiction, which made the entire message a bit vague.

I.e.

> **When your company or organisation has not yet started trading**
HMRC considers that your company or organisation has not yet become active or started trading if it has not yet engaged in any business activity (business activity means carrying on a trade or profession, or buying and selling goods or services with a view to making a profit or surplus).

But notice "*may*" as seen relative to the above paragraph [here][1].

Then through the rest of the page nothing states as to how I can find this out.

I am pretty sure that based off of the above my company is considered dormant by HMRC, but as you can see it is a little vague, so I was hoping if someone could clear this up for me.

Thanks in advance!

No. This is based upon person experience. I started a company in the UK several years ago with a view of trading with it later. I still had to submit annual returns (showing all parts at "nil"). 

I would suggest that you write them a letter (yes, I know old fashioned). The online forms are not as effective. Explain that the company is not trading. Although, as you are only waiting for 3 months before trading it will not matter as much. Happy to expand on the answer if it helps?
