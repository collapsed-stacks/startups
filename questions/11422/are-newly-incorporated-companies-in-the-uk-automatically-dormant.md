<p><strong>The title above is the basic question I want answering.</strong></p>

<p>I have a company that has never traded since it was initially created, and won't be trading for at least another three months. However, I was on the Government's website and they had a bit of a contradiction, which made the entire message a bit vague.</p>

<p>I.e.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>When your company or organisation has not yet started trading</strong>
  HMRC considers that your company or organisation has not yet become active or started trading if it has not yet engaged in any business activity (business activity means carrying on a trade or profession, or buying and selling goods or services with a view to making a profit or surplus).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But notice "<em>may</em>" as seen relative to the above paragraph <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/corporation-tax-trading-and-non-trading#dormant" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>Then through the rest of the page nothing states as to how I can find this out.</p>

<p>I am pretty sure that based off of the above my company is considered dormant by HMRC, but as you can see it is a little vague, so I was hoping if someone could clear this up for me.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>No. This is based upon person experience. I started a company in the UK several years ago with a view of trading with it later. I still had to submit annual returns (showing all parts at "nil"). </p>

<p>I would suggest that you write them a letter (yes, I know old fashioned). The online forms are not as effective. Explain that the company is not trading. Although, as you are only waiting for 3 months before trading it will not matter as much. Happy to expand on the answer if it helps?</p>
