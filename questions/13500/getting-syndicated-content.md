<p>As a startup, resources are scarce with many people wearing many different hats.  Marketing is often an overlooked and overworked but extremely necessary department.</p>

<p>One way I have found to stay in front of my customer base is to continually provide relevant content (blog posts, articles, evaluations analysis, etc.)  When working for a well established firm, this was easy (relatively speaking) as I had more time to devote to such things.</p>

<p>How does one go about obtaining syndicated content or content written by others for republication whether it be on a website, a blog post, email marketing or case studies for customer engagement?</p>

<p>Most of everything I have found have been syndication services where they are expecting me (by me, I mean they assume I work for a large company with tons of content to syndicate) to do the writing.  </p>
