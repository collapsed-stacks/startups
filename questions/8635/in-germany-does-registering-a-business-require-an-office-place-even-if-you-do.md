Me and a friend of mine are thinking about starting up a business in **Germany**. Just one very simple question, do we need to have a place (like office or something) for the registration and the whole process. It's just software stuff, mainly web-development.

I mean *we don't need an office as we can organize our work from home*. So do we still need an office?

Yes. I did and still have a business registered on my private adress, and had multible .de Domains (see comment of question). 

Only requirement is, that it is 'your' own adress (or that of the company depending on if it is a Kapitalgesellschaft => UG, GmbH, AG or a Personengesellschaft => EK, OHG, KG etc.) and you can access it 'unverz√ºglich', which is not the same as 'sofort'.
