<p>Me and a friend of mine are thinking about starting up a business in <strong>Germany</strong>. Just one very simple question, do we need to have a place (like office or something) for the registration and the whole process. It's just software stuff, mainly web-development.</p>

<p>I mean <em>we don't need an office as we can organize our work from home</em>. So do we still need an office?</p>

<p>Yes. I did and still have a business registered on my private adress, and had multible .de Domains (see comment of question). </p>

<p>Only requirement is, that it is 'your' own adress (or that of the company depending on if it is a Kapitalgesellschaft => UG, GmbH, AG or a Personengesellschaft => EK, OHG, KG etc.) and you can access it 'unverz√ºglich', which is not the same as 'sofort'. </p>
