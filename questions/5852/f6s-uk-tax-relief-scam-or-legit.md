I recently got a message from F6S from London, saying they want to help our company getting claim back our R&D spending into cash (with their % fee). Their speed of operating and insisting on signing the deal seems a little bit alarming and I don't have any lawyer to gave it a quick look.

I wanted to ask if someone has been working with them, and have a positive feedback?

Regards
Milosz

> Definitely **not** a scam.

They're offering a R&D Tax Relief Service to startups that takes advantage of the UK's [R&D Tax Credit scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_Development_Tax_Credit). They most likely make money by take a percentage from the credit you'll receive that's how they can offer the service for free.

If you're considering using them you should know that there is a process involved and most likely it requires more than just signing a paper. So you should have a lawyer take a look at it.
