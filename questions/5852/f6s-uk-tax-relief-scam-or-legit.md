<p>I recently got a message from F6S from London, saying they want to help our company getting claim back our R&amp;D spending into cash (with their % fee). Their speed of operating and insisting on signing the deal seems a little bit alarming and I don't have any lawyer to gave it a quick look.</p>

<p>I wanted to ask if someone has been working with them, and have a positive feedback?</p>

<p>Regards
Milosz</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Definitely <strong>not</strong> a scam.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They're offering a R&amp;D Tax Relief Service to startups that takes advantage of the UK's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_Development_Tax_Credit" rel="nofollow">R&amp;D Tax Credit scheme</a>. They most likely make money by take a percentage from the credit you'll receive that's how they can offer the service for free.</p>

<p>If you're considering using them you should know that there is a process involved and most likely it requires more than just signing a paper. So you should have a lawyer take a look at it.</p>
