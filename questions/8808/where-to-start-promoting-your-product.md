I currently have several apps in the app store. There is one that (at least I think :) ) has some potential. I have absolutely no idea how to sell or promote this app in any sense. 

Of course I could buy some adsense ads by google or some other vendor, but that feels too vague for me. Can somebody give me a starting point? What not to do and what are good things to do. Any help is appreciated!

Advertising on Instagram has yielded the best results for me. Instagram is owned by Facebook, so you would do this using the Facebook Ads program.

Instagram ads get seen and clicked through many more times than Facebook ads in my experience. It's just the hip place to advertise to young people.

You are able to choose specific age ranges, specific genders, interests of all kinds, countries, cities, and so on and so on.

Not to mention, the ads look beautiful on Instagram if you put in a decent effort. They are also pretty cheap. You can get seen a thousand or more times for a dollar, if I remember correctly. 

Good luck.

If your app replaces an existing better known service, without any benefits, then ask yourself why anyone would risk changing a tried and tested method for something that brings no extra benefits and creates possible risks.

Does your app target a particular audience? Is it sold, or is it free? 

Engage with one or two test customers that are local to you. I suggest you write to them (real mail, not email as your email will likely get deleted as spam). Follow it up with a phone call. End user perception is important and the information they share with you will allow you to improve your app.

Bloggers and magazine reviews will also help.

Lastly, link to your app in the app store via your website, your email signature and any social media that you have.
