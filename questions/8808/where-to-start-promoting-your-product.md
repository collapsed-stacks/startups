<p>I currently have several apps in the app store. There is one that (at least I think :) ) has some potential. I have absolutely no idea how to sell or promote this app in any sense. </p>

<p>Of course I could buy some adsense ads by google or some other vendor, but that feels too vague for me. Can somebody give me a starting point? What not to do and what are good things to do. Any help is appreciated!</p>

<p>Advertising on Instagram has yielded the best results for me. Instagram is owned by Facebook, so you would do this using the Facebook Ads program.</p>

<p>Instagram ads get seen and clicked through many more times than Facebook ads in my experience. It's just the hip place to advertise to young people.</p>

<p>You are able to choose specific age ranges, specific genders, interests of all kinds, countries, cities, and so on and so on.</p>

<p>Not to mention, the ads look beautiful on Instagram if you put in a decent effort. They are also pretty cheap. You can get seen a thousand or more times for a dollar, if I remember correctly. </p>

<p>Good luck.</p>

<p>If your app replaces an existing better known service, without any benefits, then ask yourself why anyone would risk changing a tried and tested method for something that brings no extra benefits and creates possible risks.</p>

<p>Does your app target a particular audience? Is it sold, or is it free? </p>

<p>Engage with one or two test customers that are local to you. I suggest you write to them (real mail, not email as your email will likely get deleted as spam). Follow it up with a phone call. End user perception is important and the information they share with you will allow you to improve your app.</p>

<p>Bloggers and magazine reviews will also help.</p>

<p>Lastly, link to your app in the app store via your website, your email signature and any social media that you have. </p>
