This startup team members are five and will increase in future. Actually, I want to know whether I should rent a big flat or one shop will be enough for my startup and why? </p>

<p>Coworking is all the rage. <a href="https://www.wework.com/" rel="nofollow">WeWork</a> is possible. Look into them, then use them as a starting place to find a few competitors and look into those also.</p>

<p>(Plus I don't know why you would buy over renting for a purpose like this in the first place.)</p>

<p>No. Don't rent to startup.</p>

<p>In fact, a good general policy is to never spend money until you are forced to because the cost of the business you would lose if you didn't exceeds the cost of the expense.</p>

<p>You should keep your overhead expenses as low as possible. Especially at the early stage. Do as much work as you can out of your home until you meet the condition described in the first paragraph. All the services you listed can be done from home.</p>

<p>If you absolutely need to use a commercial office space outside of your home for some reason, consider virtual offices. They are low cost and you only pay for what you use. <a href="http://www.regus.com" rel="nofollow">Regus is a good example</a>.</p>
