<p>I've graduated in electrical engineering and have used spaced repetition technique for learning formulie and new concept. I think it would be great idea if I could make money with this idea, so I started making cards in <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Anki</a> I made 613 <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1460254598" rel="nofollow noreferrer">cards</a>. When I sent my idea to some coaching institute (here in India who teaches students to crack certain competitive examination) none of them responded. So, should I spend more time with this idea and make my own version of software but then how will I attract audience? Or should I give up on this idea ?   </p>

<p>Everyone that embarks on this type of journey has to find out how to attract customers. </p>

<p>You will hear it said that the best products attract their own attention: if you make a better mouse trap the world will beat a path to your door. </p>

<p>There is no simple answer to your question. The are many steps to success or failure. </p>

<p>To ensure success of your product/service, you first have to test the market. You must learn to think like the people you are trying to reach. Ask yourself where would this person be looking for my product/service.  If it is truly a useful or desirable product/service, word of mouth may very well be sufficient. (I have told countless people about <em>teamviewer</em> and they did not pay me a dime to do so.)  Word-of-mouth is an optimal method of marketing, carrying the lowest cost of user acquisition ($0.00) and the highest credibility (personal referral).   </p>

<p>Think of the process as a journey.  Find other products like yours and research how people find them. Determine if those methods will work for your product/service.</p>

<p>I'm not too familiar with your products. However, it is probably not a bad idea to do a little bit of research of what's already out there. In particular:</p>

<ol>
<li>Products that are similar to yours where your products can be the substitute products.</li>
<li>Products where your products can be complementary to it.</li>
</ol>

<p>For no.1 you can then look into the market that these existing products are already selling into and see if you can get them to convert to your products.</p>

<p>For no.2 try to see if you can approach their market and sell your products as complementary products together with the existing products in the market.</p>

<p>All the best!</p>

<p>I would say use the Lean Startup approach outlined by Eric Ries and Steve Blank. They revolutionized the way a startup gets going buy getting a proof of concept before development, introducing a minimum viable product to potential customers and as they put it "getting out of the building" to interact with your customers (or potential customers) to quickly change your product and business in small iterations to avoid loss of time and money spent developing something no one wants or a product people want but features no one wants.</p>

<p>Here's a link to Eric's book: <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0307887898" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous-Innovation/dp/0307887898</a></p>

<p>Another great resource is Steve Blank's free Udacity course: <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-build-a-startup--ep245" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-build-a-startup--ep245</a></p>

<p>The course goes through step by step exercises to help you take your idea and build a product people want. </p>
