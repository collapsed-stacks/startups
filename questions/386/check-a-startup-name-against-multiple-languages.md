<p>Is there a service somewhere which can check if a new business name exists as a word / noun in other languages? I couldn't find an online dictionary which could search multiple languages at once.</p>

<p>The use case is :</p>

<p>I want to check that my new business name e.g. '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley_(TV_series)">hooli</a>' does not mean something unfortunate in other languages which share the same or similar alphabet.</p>

<p>If this service doesn't exist, would others find it useful?</p>

<p>A poor man's attempt would be to use <a href="http://translate.google.com" rel="nofollow">translate.google.com</a> for your business name and check the langauges for areas that you will consider as possible markets. You can also look up your name against registered businesses in most states.</p>

<p>The whole issue of branding, logo checks, copyright, trademark, and service mark development is also one that often may be handled by engaging with companies who do this research for a living ... (consider that a cost of doing business).</p>

<p>While you may be just looking to avoid trying to create a car branded Nova to market in Spanish language speaking areas where no va means "does not go" .. the issues are much larger than just your company or product name.</p>

<p>ErstwhileIII has a great solution, but you can also do an "any language" search in Google search proper.</p>

<p>However, that won't catch homophones in non-latin alphabet languages. ErstwhileIII brought up the Nova as a great example.</p>

<p>For that, I would recommend choosing a few language priority countries-areas that you plan to expand into--and going onto Reddit with your top choices to see if any passionate linguists would be willing to give their opinion.</p>

<p>For example, China speaks Mandarin and Cantonese primarily. You could ask forums such as /r/askReddit or /r/Chineselanguage for assistance, or offer a small wage in exchange for finding a decent translation for your name into your target language.</p>

<p>Protip: do not trust Google Translate for Chinese, it's too contextual a language.</p>

<p>Let me comment on a business side of this idea.
A service like that would be useful, but I doubt many would pay for it.
Usually, people don't open companies on a daily basis. At least not companies where names matter.
So there's no need for an automation or monthly subscription. I would rather pay someone to do the search for me once than to buy some automated service.</p>

<p>Free service like that would be nice though.</p>
