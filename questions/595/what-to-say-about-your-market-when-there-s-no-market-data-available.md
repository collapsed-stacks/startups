<p>I'm putting a pitch deck together for my startup and am stuck on what to put in the "Market" section. The problem is, my startup is part of a relatively new and undefined market. I can't simply say the market is $X Billion because I have no data to back that up. I could speak to the "parent" industry (email service providers) - but my startup isn't technically an email service provider itself. </p>

<p>What should I say about the market in my pitch deck when my market is largely undefined?</p>

<p>From my own experience, there is always a specific market and a way to define it, but sometimes it isn't obvious who your customers/users are. In a new market or where you make radical change, the definition can be difficult, but always possible. </p>

<p>Maybe you need to ask yourself, who the market is in a different way?</p>

<p>Who is the market for email and how to define it, could be asked with these questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Who has a need for communication</li>
<li>How many people have access via a computer and internet</li>
<li>For whom is sending letters via the internet an improvement over simply sending a mail</li>
<li>What needs can email cover</li>
<li>etc..</li>
</ul>

<p>When I was starting a project database for students and companies to share knowledge with one another, I had a hard time defining the market, since no such database existed to my knowledge. I knew the number of students and companies, but needed to define the number of paying customers. How could I do that, when wasn't any companies paying for such a service at the moment.</p>

<p>The way I did it, was to look at similar services, such as a job-database. Here I could see the amount of money companies would spend, which gave me some idea of a value for my own project. Then I called around 50 companies asking them, what they would pay for my service. Most of them where quit open and gave some good feedback.</p>

<p>Hope you can use for something, otherwise try to describe your startup a little more and more better answers would come.</p>
