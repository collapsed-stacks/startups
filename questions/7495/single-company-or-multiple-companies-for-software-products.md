<p>For context, we are in the UK and we are build SaaS (Software as a Service) products unrelated to each other. They are aimed at different target markets and industries. Some of them are on initial and concept stages and others will soon start generating revenue.</p>

<p>We will seek professional advice but I thought it would be good to get knowledge from the community.</p>

<p>Would it be best to register a different legal entity for each product we are building? Or is it best to register a single company that owns all products?</p>

<p>Are there any best practices for this or would any recommendations from experience?</p>

<p><strong>The default answer is no.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Why?</strong> Because multiple companies usually lead to more paperwork and expenses - independently from the country you're located in.</p>

<p>Though there are reasons for multiple companies. E.g. </p>

<ul>
<li>if a product is high risk you may want to isolate risk via separate companies</li>
<li>if different founders are involved in your products</li>
</ul>
