What do you typically call those people in a company which mainly realise projects for clients?

Typically you have one team that is responsible for developing the product. I would call its employees developers.

But there are often people or teams who are not involved in developing the product but setting it up for clients, doing customisations, and so on... Usually there is a project manager. But this is only one person. What about the others doing the "actual" work?

What would you call that? What would you call those employees?

While your title is confusing, it seems you're asking what the title is of the person responsible for setting up client software (or other) builds or unique-customization-setups to fit the client's business or other setup.

At many companies, this a responsibility of project managers, who generally have the best communication skills of a team, or even the software leads may be directly involved, since they often have the most technical skill (particularly if it is the first or second of which setup is required).

Ideally, after a few iterations, the PM then assumes responsibility and can manage calls, taking back any questions to his engineering team.

Some companies have such high volume of this, they build titles such as "Software Client Leader" and such.

Where the per client setup of a product is a complex process it is common to form implementation teams:
 
- Implementation Manager who manages a team of
 - Implementation Consultant(s)

They are responsible for going from a sale to implemented 'business as normal' system as smoothly and quickly as possible.

This was the setup at a pensions company I used to work for. When a 'group' pension scheme was sold to a company, the implementation consultants would manage the process of on-boarding the company's existing employees, customizing paper work/logos, creating website user accounts etc.
