I'm looking for an HR management solution that has the ability to track vacations, salaries, bonuses, etc. There are many invoicing solutions, payroll solutions, etc, but I haven't found any good HR management solutions so far. It also has to be affordable. Are there any good HR tools available for free or a small monthly subscription?

I found plenty solutions here:
http://www.capterra.com/human-resource-software/

Average cost on an entry level plan is under $100 for most of them. I would encourage people to try more than one and see which one works.

I found one that claims to be absolutely free, so I decided to try it and giving you my opinion:
http://www.zenefits.com/

The solution is mostly focused on US employees and mostly on HR related functionality, which rendered it to be useless for my case.

Particularly, I was looking to combine HR records with billing clients for hours based on HR records. Zenefits lacks invoicing feature unfortunately. It also requires every entered individual to be a US employee, which is not the case for global companies and for business with subcontractors that still need to track subcontractor's hours, equipment, etc.

I still believe it's worth trying if one needs it for purely HR functions.

I didn't find the perfect one for my needs yet, but I believe my needs are too specific to be interesting for the community.
