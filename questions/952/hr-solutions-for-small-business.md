<p>I'm looking for an HR management solution that has the ability to track vacations, salaries, bonuses, etc. There are many invoicing solutions, payroll solutions, etc, but I haven't found any good HR management solutions so far. It also has to be affordable. Are there any good HR tools available for free or a small monthly subscription?</p>

<p>I found plenty solutions here:
<a href="http://www.capterra.com/human-resource-software/" rel="nofollow">http://www.capterra.com/human-resource-software/</a></p>

<p>Average cost on an entry level plan is under $100 for most of them. I would encourage people to try more than one and see which one works.</p>

<p>I found one that claims to be absolutely free, so I decided to try it and giving you my opinion:
<a href="http://www.zenefits.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.zenefits.com/</a></p>

<p>The solution is mostly focused on US employees and mostly on HR related functionality, which rendered it to be useless for my case.</p>

<p>Particularly, I was looking to combine HR records with billing clients for hours based on HR records. Zenefits lacks invoicing feature unfortunately. It also requires every entered individual to be a US employee, which is not the case for global companies and for business with subcontractors that still need to track subcontractor's hours, equipment, etc.</p>

<p>I still believe it's worth trying if one needs it for purely HR functions.</p>

<p>I didn't find the perfect one for my needs yet, but I believe my needs are too specific to be interesting for the community.</p>
