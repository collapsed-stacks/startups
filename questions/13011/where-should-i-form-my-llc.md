I am going to be starting a software startup online and I donâ€™t plan on selling any physical goods. I am considering registering outside of my home state of Illinois mainly because of a $500 filing fee. If I formed an LLC in a different state, what would be the catch, would I have to register in my home state too, or is it just in the state I chose to register in?

Thanks a lot!
