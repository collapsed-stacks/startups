<p>Most people seem to agree that each objective should have 3-5 supporting key results. However, I am confused on whether you should have one objective, or multiple objectives, in each quarterly period.</p>

<p>My worry is that having multiple objectives dilutes your focus.</p>

<p>Are there any case studies which optimises the number of objectives?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> OKRs stands for Objectives and Key Results. It is a method of defining and tracking objectives and their outcomes.</p>

<p>I'm not aware of any case studies that seek to determine the "optimal" number of objectives. With 3-5 results per objective, though, I'd be surprised if the optimal number of objectives is anything but one. Because your short-term memory register <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11515286" rel="nofollow">has four slots</a>.</p>
