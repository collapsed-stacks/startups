Most people seem to agree that each objective should have 3-5 supporting key results. However, I am confused on whether you should have one objective, or multiple objectives, in each quarterly period.

My worry is that having multiple objectives dilutes your focus.

Are there any case studies which optimises the number of objectives?

**EDIT:** OKRs stands for Objectives and Key Results. It is a method of defining and tracking objectives and their outcomes.

I'm not aware of any case studies that seek to determine the "optimal" number of objectives. With 3-5 results per objective, though, I'd be surprised if the optimal number of objectives is anything but one. Because your short-term memory register [has four slots](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11515286).
