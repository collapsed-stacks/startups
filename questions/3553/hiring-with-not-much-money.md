I have what I think is a pretty good idea (we all say that) that I want to implement 
but to make it work, the UI and UX must be really intuitive and "clean" and I have 
no knowledge about UX. 

Problem is that I am a developer that just graduated (hence not much money) and I need
a good designer to help me out. However, I have no experience in hiring nor how 
to deal with money in a situation like this.

Two solutions come to my mind.

First one is to be cheap about the pay but I don't think that would result in a 
good work relationship or good work results.

Second one is to make someone kind of an associate but I don't really know if 
that would work or if someone would commit to a project for free.

How expensive would a good designer cost?   
Is my second thought valid and achievable?  
How would you hire a designer in a situation like this (does the porfolio do it all?)?

Why? Realize that you want to have a really intuitive interface and user experience, but that's not a reason to spend money on a designer in my opinion.

It means that it appears you're assuming that design is a factor in the success of you're idea -- and currently, based on the information present, I see no reason to believe that's the case. My experience is that it in general, it is not. If your solution is needed, then in my opinion even a basic understanding of design is all that's required.

Only after you've validated that you have a solution will provide a means of supporting itself should you review if a professional design is required.
