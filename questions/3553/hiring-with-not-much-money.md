<p>I have what I think is a pretty good idea (we all say that) that I want to implement 
but to make it work, the UI and UX must be really intuitive and "clean" and I have 
no knowledge about UX. </p>

<p>Problem is that I am a developer that just graduated (hence not much money) and I need
a good designer to help me out. However, I have no experience in hiring nor how 
to deal with money in a situation like this.</p>

<p>Two solutions come to my mind.</p>

<p>First one is to be cheap about the pay but I don't think that would result in a 
good work relationship or good work results.</p>

<p>Second one is to make someone kind of an associate but I don't really know if 
that would work or if someone would commit to a project for free.</p>

<p>How expensive would a good designer cost?<br>
Is my second thought valid and achievable?<br>
How would you hire a designer in a situation like this (does the porfolio do it all?)?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Why? Realize that you want to have a really intuitive interface and user experience, but that's not a reason to spend money on a designer in my opinion. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Does that mean I should design on my own even though failing the UI
  might fail the project? Or that I should take the time into designing
  or be independent?</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It means that it appears you're assuming that design is a factor in the success of you're idea -- and currently, based on the information present, I see no reason to believe that's the case. My experience is that it in general, it is not. If your solution is needed, then in my opinion even a basic understanding of design is all that's required.</p>

<p>Only after you've validated that you have a solution will provide a means of supporting itself should you review if a professional design is required.</p>
