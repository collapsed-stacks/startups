I am a single member LLC that is working on my first deal whereby I would build custom enterprise software for a client that has about 1000 employees.

I have expertise that makes me attractive to this company for building software, however one of the things they may be concerned about is their liability in the case that I go bankrupt or otherwise flake-out (since I am a startup and they are my first client).

Can this company, my client, insure themselves against the event that my business fails and they have to pick up the pieces.  I realize they would litigate against my company and my professional liability insurance could come into play.  But I am interested in something that the client could purchase for peace of mind for the project.

Does such insurance exist and, if so, what is it called?
