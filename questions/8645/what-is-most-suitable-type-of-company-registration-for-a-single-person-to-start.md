What is the best way of registering company (either sole proprietor or LLP) to choose for my start up company in India. What are the pros and cons of each option? 

I researched but could not find the answers for my questions.The following are my questions,

1. Right now I have few people (3 0r 4) working with me and may hire in future as my business grows. In which option (either sole proprietor or LLP) I can extend my company ?

2. If I am getting fund, will there be any issue ? or which is the best option to get funding without any difficulty ?

3. In which option I can add directors to my company ? In other words in which option I can convert or transfer single person company to 2 person company ?
