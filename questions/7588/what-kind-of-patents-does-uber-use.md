## What kind of patents does Uber use?

Uber has over a dozen patents for ideas and concepts and non-tangible entities, such as **"PROVIDING ON-DEMAND SERVICES THROUGH USE OF PORTABLE COMPUTING DEVICES" and "PROVIDING NOTIFICATIONS TO DEVICES BASED ON REAL-TIME CONDITIONS RELATED TO AN ON-DEMAND SERVICE."**

What type of patents are these? I have a business model concept in mind that I want to patent before launching, but I'm not sure what type of patent it requires.

Can we file a single umbrella patent that covers multiple angles? Or do we need to file a single patent for all different approaches?

Lastly, would provisional patents work for these types of patents?

I'm filing in the US.
