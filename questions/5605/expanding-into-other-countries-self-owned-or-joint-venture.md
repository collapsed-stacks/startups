If a service require local presence, e.g. need to have a local team for Operations, Customer services, Marketing etc.

Of course you can setup and hired the staffs by your own if you have a deep pocket, but the risk is still high as you are not familiar with the local market.

How about partner with a local partner, and setup a joint venture for the localized service. 

Is it common? Anything need to be-careful if you choose to use the method to expand? Any example company also using this method?

No. You'd usually find multiple local partners, or find one and negotiate an exclusive deal in exchange for bootstrapping you in the country. That way if you're unhappy with the partner, or when the contract expires a few years later, you can change partners or find new ones.
