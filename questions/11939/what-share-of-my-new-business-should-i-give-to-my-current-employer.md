<p>I am starting a business and will soon register it. I have been using various machines, tools and materials of the company I currently work at for product development. I am not an employee, more an unofficial intern; I am not paid and have never signed any work contract or agreement. </p>

<p>Because I have been using valuable machines, I think my "employer" has a potential right to a share of the business, and I want to resolve this issue now.</p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>what items should I consider before deciding whether my employer actually owns a part of my future business?</li>
<li>what other common options are there other than giving ownership? (I am very low on cash...)</li>
<li>how should I introduce the conversation with my employer? (though he knows already I have been working on this project)</li>
</ul>

<p>Start by consulting an attorney.  Even though you never signed a contract or were paid, it is possible your "employer" has some rights to your product/company.</p>

<p>Other than ownership/shares, you could offer a percentage of sales or a royalty payment. (It's not clear what your product/service offering is)</p>

<p>Once you understand your legal position, you should be honest and transparent.  You've obviously provided some value by working for free. And if the employer is already aware of what you are up to, you probably don't need to offer much in the way of compensation.  But if this person is of value to you, and can provide a valuable service or guidance, then just do what you think is fair.</p>
