<p>After some months of business, we realized that we have generated a bunch of information that could be sold as a second product. It could also be interesting for other companies.</p>

<p>But we don't know any place in the Internet to sell it. Is there any kind of website for selling databases?</p>

<p>In case it's relevant, I am talking about 45 million domains with IPS, HTML metadata and so on.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>I am basically trying to find an application like <a href="https://www.seoclerk.com/" rel="nofollow">SEOClerks</a>, but a bit more specific.
<a href="https://fiverr.com/" rel="nofollow">Fiverr</a> is also good but it has a price restriction.</p>

<p>I'm not aware of any platform to buy website data, but googling that and variations of it may turn up a few interesting results.</p>

<p>Alternatively, try to locate the clients directly. If you've been scraping this data, chances are someone else might be doing so as well. Try SEO forums or similar places where tool or service vendors might be interested in accessing and analyzing your dataset. (Note that your dataset is still small though, so don't get too excited with the idea.)</p>

<p>A shortcut to find these qualified leads might be to speak to companies that offer IP proxying and rotating services such as ProxyMesh. In exchange for a fee, they might end up blasting their list to highlight your data set, or simply point you to a relevant venue.</p>
