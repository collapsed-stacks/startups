<p>Say a client ordered something and I've failed to deliver the product/service. Of course, both me and my client agree that my client should get a refund.</p>

<p>This seems pretty straightforward, however, my client demands that his refund is in the current currency rate. For example:</p>

<p>The client bought a product from me for $1 but the currency USD has increased by $1 (not very realistic of course). Should I refund $1 or $2? What's the right of the client? And how does the legal system work when it comes to these kind of issues?</p>

<p>I agree with @Fernando that as a rule of thumb, you should refund at purchase price. But given that it's a difficult client, and that you haven't a written policy on this, you should consider refunding him at current value and consider it a PR investment.</p>

<p>After resolving this issue you should add to your terms and conditions info that any refund will be issued at purchasing price.</p>

<p>Standard practice is to refund at the purchased price. It will also irritate customers to get anything less than a full refund even if you tell them it is for inflationary purposes.</p>

<p>Unless the currency system you are in has exorbitant inflation this shouldn't be something you devote much time to.</p>

<p>Refund the money in full and consider it a great investment. Use it to ask yourself why did this customer want the refund? What can I do better to avoid this next time?</p>

<p>As far as the legal system, that is something I am sure is specific to different areas. Consider adding location information and information about the product if you want a more accurate response to that portion of the question.</p>

<p>Depends on local business best practices, I would say.</p>

<p>If all your local transactions are, for some reason, priced in US Dollars (even if paid in your local currency), then it makes sense to adjust for currency variation. </p>

<p>If your inflation rate is huge, then it makes sense to adjust for money value.</p>

<p>If neither is true, makes little sense.</p>

<p>Do note that if one of the above is true for your region, there might be laws or regulations ruling over this sort of issue.</p>
