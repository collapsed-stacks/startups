I left my previous employer in 2009.  I developed software for them when I worked there and after I left I was hired as a software developer to make changes.

Therefore I registered as a business in 2009.  I came across Microsoft Bizspark in 2013: https://www.microsoft.com/bizspark/.  I satisfied the three items of criteria:

 1. Earns less than Â£1M annually (does not earn anything) 
 2. In business less than five years 
 3. Privately owned

I registered for Bizspark in 2013 because I did not want to miss out because of the five year rule.  I explained my ideas and I was accepted.  My subscription expires later this year (the three years expires)..

I have never used Bizspark (never activated it or renewed it).  I just have not had the time to progress my idea (I also work full time for an employer).  I registered with Bizspark in 2013 because I did not want to miss out on the five year rule.  Bizspark support said that you have to register within five years of starting the business (2009) at the time. However in an email I received recently Bizspark Support said that the five year rules applies from the time you get the idea i.e. you could register a business in 2009 and have an idea in 2016 and therefore get the benefits of Bizspark from 2016 (assuming that the two other items of criteria are met).

My subscription expires later this year.  Has anyone had any luck extending there subscription or creating a new account in the future after having an old account?
