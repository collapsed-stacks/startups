I've heard in some occasions about a term: Fantasy Name. But I don't know what is that.

So, if I'm opening an start-up do I have to choose both Name and Fantasy Name for it? What are the differences? Can any of them be not unique among all companies in the world?

A Fantasy name is made up name (ie fantasy) with no real world meaning. This can be handy as it reduces your chance of name conflicts, and enhances recognizeability - like for example will you recognize Jo's Software or Jobondare more.

No; all you have to choose is a name. That name *might* be a fantasy name but you only are choosing one name.

>Can any of them be not unique among all companies in the world?

Possibly but not required nor guaranteed. There is no global registrar of corporations; most companies are registered on a provincial/state level and at that level most often there are restrictions to prevent similar names. Fantasy names have a slight advantage there since more often than not they will be unique unlike for example 'Victoria Shoe Repair'. 

Depending on trade treaties and a *LOT* of legislation and relative ages of companies and amount of legal clout (ie money to burn) a company may be able to effectively have a unique name on a global scale; but in most cases you really don't have to worry about that.
