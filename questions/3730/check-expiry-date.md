<p>I have received a banker's check which HSBC New York sent after closing my account. There is no mention of expiry date. Can somebody inform me how many months are USA checks valid?</p>

<p>There is no fixed expiration date if it's not stated on the check, and even if it is stated on the check, it's up to the two banks processing the check to decide if they'd honor the check. Further, even if the check is expired, that's not a valid reason for a debt to expire unless this was agreed to in writing; meaning even if the check was expired, they should issue a new check if you contact them.</p>
