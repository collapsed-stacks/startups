<p><strong>Editing the original question to meet this community rules:</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>How can I validate is it good idea for helping anyone to stay on track and convert goals to achievement? Also, any general idea about where I can find early customers?</em></strong></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Earlier question:</strong>
Idea is to help user create, share, track and achieve goals (Promises). Here are few features I’m thinking about:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create goal and share with friends/well wishers as promise card  </li>
<li>Friends / well wishers would be able to encourage by responding to<br>
promise card within the app </li>
<li>App will send daily motivation, articles,    images customized for the goal </li>
<li>User would be able to track the progress </li>
<li>User will get points for achieving goal, sharing goals and if someone copies their goal </li>
<li>Promise cards will be two types – Shared personally with you, shared publicly by community</li>
</ol>

<p>Revenue model thinking about two options:</p>

<ol>
<li>Subscription for advanced features (yet to identify)</li>
<li>Additional features for reward points gathered by user and have option to buy more points for those features</li>
</ol>

<p>Looking for feedback on below two points and any other general feedback?
<strong>(NOTE: These are the main points I am trying to validate. Can you give me suggestions on rewording/asking them, who to target to, how I can go about getting feedback on questions like these, etc?)</strong></p>

<p><strong>SAMPLE Questions I would be needing feedback on:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>What do you think about name for the app – “Promise”. It’s like Make the promise, keep promise!</li>
<li>Revenue model</li>
</ol>

<p>It's a good idea! As far as revenue model goes, you need to have a better clarity on the target group. Miguel, clearly identified that the same thing is available in many other places. I can see this after some tweaking being useful to memory challenged adults, children, and educators. Each group requires a different sale/revenue scheme. </p>

<li><p>This post should be flagged as it's hardly a question (am I doing this right?)</p></li>
<li><p>The general idea behind this all is far too simple, unless there are some great ideas you haven't shared with us. I suggest going back to the drawing board and doing some serious brainstorming, either to get a better idea or to improve this one into something new to the market.</p></li>
<li><p>The only possible revenue model here should be free as it's a service you can find for free in multiple places. Monetize it with ads once you got a sizable user base and try to add a lot of side features to make it more useful.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Hope that helps.</p>
