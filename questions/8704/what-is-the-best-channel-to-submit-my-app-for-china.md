<p>As far as I know about China is that Google Play Store (GPS) is blocked. Due to that circumstance, I need to find a way to publish my app beside GPS. The alternatives are baidu app store, myapp, 360shouji, etc. </p>

<p>So here is my question, among the alternatives mentioned above, which app store is the most dedicated candidate to submit my app? Should I submit it in all three? or any others?</p>
