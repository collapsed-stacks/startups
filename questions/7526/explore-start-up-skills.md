<p>I have a start up and am looking to scale up now. I want to explore some team building stuff, so would love to get a feel for what skills are out there, how much people are paid etc. </p>

<p>I was wondering if there is a recruitment site etc. where you can browse people who are job hunting and see similar job postings + salaries and packages etc. Ideally one with a strong amount of UK / London info? </p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Some nice recruitment tools/websites are:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/" rel="nofollow">LinkedIn</a>: Cause it's the standard when it comes to recruitment, and it's just too good</li>
<li><a href="https://angel.co/jobs" rel="nofollow">Angelist</a>: The go-to website for startup recruiting. I have recruited from Angel, and I really like the experience</li>
<li><a href="https://unicornhunt.io/" rel="nofollow">Unicorn.io</a>: Another nice recruiting platform for Europe (mainly UK) baased startups</li>
<li><a href="http://www.glassdoor.com" rel="nofollow">Glassdoor</a>: For looking at similar job postings + salaries and packages etc</li>
<li>SackOverflow Careers</li>
</ol>
