<p>I'm trying to expand my customer base for my small business, to do this, Id like to buy a database containing the information I need.</p>

<p>I've done a little research about the legality of purchasing databases and databases with personal information, but I still have a few unanswered and very simple questions I need answered.</p>

<p>Firstly, where do I go to buy databases? Do I have to speak with a company that insolvent or is there a market?</p>

<p>What form do the databases come in? Do they come as the database files (mdf, ldf) a backup, scripted out??</p>

<p>Any help and guidance will be much appreciated!</p>

<p>Thanks in advance,</p>

<p>Gareth</p>

<p>I hate to see a question sitting this long without an answer. So here goes:</p>

<p>There are markets for databases, but depending on the information you are looking for you may have to explore independent sources. Brad Rhoads was completely correct. You can probably find what you are looking for with a search engine, if it exists.</p>

<p>As for database format... it could be just about anything.</p>

<p>If you need more details, feel free to ask.</p>
