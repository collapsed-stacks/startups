It would be best to find a developer with an entrepreneurial flare. They are not hard to find. If you apply yourself and really dig deep, chances are you can find yourself a developer with an MBA/DBA. This will allow you to bring on someone not only with the relevant technical experience but who also has a good idea of how a business *should* be run and what's really important (strategy, execution, timing, funding, etc).

With regards to what you should offer, that depends on the situation, the product and the potential future of the product. If you find an exceptional individual the stakes will be high - partnership, for example.  The real question is **how much of your company are you willing to give up in order to increase the likelihood of improving its potential**. Exceptional people do not come cheap and I wouldn't suggest hiring or partnering with anyone less than exceptional. 

In terms of where you should find these people, perhaps have a look at angel.co
