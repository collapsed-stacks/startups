<p>When I use an image with Creative Commons license on my android app, can I just add the name of owner to the credits part or should I mention it on each work?</p>

<p>Take a look at the best practices guide from creative commons on how to <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/Best_practices_for_attribution" rel="nofollow">attribute</a> and what constitutes a good attribution. As mentioned in the guide a good rule of thumb is to use the <code>TASL</code> acronym.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>T - Title, what is the name of the material?</p>
  
  <p>A - Author, who owns the material?</p>
  
  <p>S - Source, where can I find it?</p>
  
  <p>L - License, How can I use it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In addition, each author should be mentioned but you can satisfy the requirements in any reasonable way. So, for videos you can put the authors in credit for images you can add a link to the source etc.</p>
