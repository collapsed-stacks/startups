We are developing a desktop app targeting education sector. In these days of mobile and web apps, desktop apps are bit out of fashion. Marketing is mostly face to face. We want to highlight the fact that offline capability and software completely under the buyers control as differentiators. The market we are addressing are places where connectivity is not good. Also we have plans to roll out a web app in the future as the situation of connectivity improves. Now given these facts is there a good strategy to be arrived at? Also apart from face to face marketing is there any other good marketing techniques for desktop apps?

I would say that the same marketing techniques that one uses to market a web based audience would be used. I would set up a landing page to gather information about the person also targeting them based on the criteria that you are looking for.

 Another thing that I do would allow the person to try the program on a server designed for tests. This gives them the try before they buy feeling without much work on the sales side.<br /> 

Not everyone is sold on the "*Cloud*" I would stress security and ownership of data as key points in your selling strategy, even if they are not necessarily more secure than the cloud people don't trust what they can see.
