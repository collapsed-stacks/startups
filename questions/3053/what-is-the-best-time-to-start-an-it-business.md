<p>The best time to start is when:</p>

<ul>
<li>You are <strong>passionate</strong> about a specific problem and <strong>understand it well</strong> </li>
<li>You can <strong>build or offer a good solution</strong> (whether it's a product or a service business)</li>
<li>You are <strong>ready to dedicate</strong> a ton of energy and time to the solution</li>
<li>You have <strong>passionate, smart co-founders</strong> who you can work well with</li>
</ul>

<p>It's very important to understand the problem you want to solve but <strong>you don't necessarily need experience</strong> in that industry. Many successful founders did not have experience in their industry but understood the problem (e.g. founders of eBay, Uber, AirBnB).</p>

<p>If you do not have all of the above, I recommend working toward gaining them. You can talk to potential customers to learn about a problem and potential solutions, work at a large company to earn enough savings to start your own, or build your network to meet potential co-founders.</p>

<p>If you're concerned about age, I think the majority of successful IT companies are started by younger founders (under 40 years old). There are always exceptions but I suspect this is because younger people have the time, energy, and fresh perspective.</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>

<p>Maybe it is important for you to understand how wide is the question you have asked! 
The term <strong><em>IT business</em></strong> may be used by Microsoft, Apple but also by the small service shop who sells cartridges at the corner of my street. 
To make a small analogy, it is as if you would ask: when is the right time to do sports? 
Do you mean an individual sport, a team sport, a motor sport, as an amateur, professional, recreational and so on.
Therefore a general answer could work for now:</p>

<ol>
<li>The right time to think about starting a business is when you have identified a <strong>specific need</strong> in the market.  </li>
<li>As long as you have identified the need then you should look to see if you have the <strong>resources to solve the need</strong> (can be money, time, knowledge or a brilliant original idea). You should know that most successful businesses are not built around an original idea. </li>
<li>If you have completed steps 1&amp;2 you should have an idea on how are you going to proceed (a basic business plan with at least an idea of a business model). </li>
</ol>

<p>You <strong>do not need to have extensive experience with the specific domain</strong>, nor a lot of time spent as an employee in a company who has done that before. But it can help you learn a lot about the future business. Actually you can read that many entrepreneurs have some sort of <strong>blind courage</strong> to start in spite of the unknown ahead. But be prepared to take some risks, learn from mistakes, to pick yourself up and start again. For encouragement here is a <a href="http://www.incomediary.com/went-bankrupt-now-worth-millions" rel="nofollow">list of people</a> who failed during their careers. </p>

<p>Note on the <strong>IT</strong> concept</p>

<p>You should consider this dilemma: is the <strong>technology in the core of your business</strong> or is it merely the tool needed to solve a problem. For instance an online shop is still a retail business, and it uses the technology as an instrument to get faster to the customers. On the other hand a company who makes plugins for software development tools has the technology as a core, and it would have a very different business model. 
Good luck! </p>
