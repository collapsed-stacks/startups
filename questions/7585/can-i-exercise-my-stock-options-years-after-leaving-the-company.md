<p>Im a little confused with the term "to vest". Let's say I have some stock options where I get 100% of the stock that was promised after 4 years working at the startup (with 1 year cliff).</p>

<p>After 2 years I decide to quit. I have 50% of stock options. Can I wait like 10 years to get the cash or do I HAVE TO get the cash right when I leave the company ?</p>

<p>N.B : I don't have a contract yet, I just want to know what is the normal case, if any</p>

<p>Usually you have to decide within 90 days after leaving the company.</p>

<p>I highly recommend you to read the following articles:</p>
