From:  https://www.saastr.com/call-owner-founder-ceo/

Customers, Prospects, Recruits and Media like to talk to “the CEO”.

Customers, especially. They want to build a personal relationship with the CEO, the one person who is making a true commitment back to them on the 5+ year customer journey.

Use that title, at least *externally*.

But...

There a times when it makes sense not to use the title of CEO.  Like negotiating with a supplier.

> Being the CEO, you have all the power in the company. You can't say
> you don't know what your budget is. You can't say you need to go check
> with your CFO. You can't say anything except yes or no.

From https://www.inc.com/leonard-kim/5-situations-where-you-shouldn-t-call-yourself-ceo.html

I know people who have two sets of business cards - one with the title *Founder* and one with the title *CEO* and then they can use the card most appropriate to who they are dealing with.  

Another option is 'owner'.

At the end of the day, I think it is important that you go with something that you feel the most comfortable with.  If you think you sound like a bit of an %^&* every time you introduce yourself as *Chief Executive Officer* or *Managing Director*, then this is going to come across.

This relates to a C-Corporation in the United States.

Founder is the proper term. When a company is formed, the original stock issued is termed "founder's stock". Often the original founder is also referred to as the President.

As far as the other duties, you can have more than one position. Often, in a small company where there is only one officer, then they hold three titles

 - Chief Executive Officer
 - Chief Financial Officer
 - Secretary of the Corporation

and typically are elected as the Chairman of the Board.
