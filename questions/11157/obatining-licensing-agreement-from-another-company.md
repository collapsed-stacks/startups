<p>I have a game idea which I wish to pursue as a new start up company, however the fundamentals of the game depend on the use of a music groups assets (music, brand, etc.). After contacting the musicians I was informed to submit my inquiry to a record label who works out their licensing.
It has been a week since I have inquired about a licensing agreement, and have yet to receive any response from the record label. </p>

<p>My question is what plans of action should I take to facilitate a response from them? Is there some other method which I could use to get permission if they do not respond?</p>

<p>Unfortunately I would like to withhold working on the project until I can further an agreement so that I do not waste time/effort on a possible un-releasable product.</p>

<p>The record label company and myself reside in Canada.</p>

<p>People are busy and don't always reply back immediately (if ever) when they receive enquiries that they think will waste their time.</p>

<p>And to be blunt, you probably are a waste of their time unless you've serious money to spend. The music business is one where asking for $10k to perform a song in public is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Birthday_to_You#Public_performances" rel="nofollow">not unheard of</a>.</p>

<p>Follow-up as many times as necessary. This is cold outreach, so three tips:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Ask for an introduction if you can get one, and follow up at least a half dozen times.</p></li>
<li><p>Be sure to spell out that you'd like to have money to spend and mean business.</p></li>
<li><p>Send a <a href="http://blog.close.io/the-breakup-email" rel="nofollow">break-up email</a> before abandoning.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>No.</p>
