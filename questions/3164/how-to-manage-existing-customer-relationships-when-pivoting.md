Depends on the situation and the relationship with the customer

**A. catering to a similar audience slightly differently**

Maintaining customer relationship is extremely important in this type of pivot. Discuss the reasoning and plans with the customer before making the pivot. Be open to suggestions and if possible continue supporting him.

**B. catering to a slightly different audience in a similar manner**
It's a small world, so you still want reasonable relationship with the customer in case your paths cross int the future. Have a frank conversation with the customer.  Be thankful to him and if possible set him up with another company/vendor who would be able to address his needs.
