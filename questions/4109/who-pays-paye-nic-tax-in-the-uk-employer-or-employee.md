If you have a limited company and you're its managing director, earning a salary, are you the one who pays PAYE/NIC to HMRC, or is it the company?

NICs are divided into **an employer contribution that the company pays** and **an employee contribution that the employee pays**, but the admin happens through payroll, so the company handles the administrative aspect (and the employee never sees the cash!).

It is sometimes a good idea to make **additional voluntary contributions**, for instance if the salary you draw is minimum wage or fluctuates. Whether this is something you should consider is a matter you might discuss with your accountant or another qualified IFA.

The company collects it as part of the payroll:

> As an employer, you normally have to operate PAYE as part of your payroll. PAYE is HM Revenue and Customsâ€™ (HMRC) system to collect Income Tax and National Insurance from employment.
