<p>NICs are divided into <strong>an employer contribution that the company pays</strong> and <strong>an employee contribution that the employee pays</strong>, but the admin happens through payroll, so the company handles the administrative aspect (and the employee never sees the cash!).</p>

<p>It is sometimes a good idea to make <strong>additional voluntary contributions</strong>, for instance if the salary you draw is minimum wage or fluctuates. Whether this is something you should consider is a matter you might discuss with your accountant or another qualified IFA.</p>

<p>The company collects it as part of the payroll:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As an employer, you normally have to operate PAYE as part of your payroll. PAYE is HM Revenue and Customsâ€™ (HMRC) system to collect Income Tax and National Insurance from employment.</p>
