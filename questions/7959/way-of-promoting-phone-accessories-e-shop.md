<p>Facebook - and more specifically - Facebook Ads, would be my first recommendation for 3 reasons.</p>

<p><strong>1. Virtually infinite targeting capabilities.</strong>
With FB ads you can really zero in on your audience. For example, you can select to target People who like "iphone" or "android".. even people who are currently USING their mobile phone viewing your ad. You can select to target a specific gender, age, people in college or not, people with a certain income level, etc. </p>

<p>You can even target people who like certain pages, for example, OtterBox and Mophie are popular brands for phone accessories. So you can actually target the people who like OtterBox, etc.. (essentially "borrowing" their customers :-)</p>

<p><strong>2. Cost effective.</strong>
Facebook ads are one of the cheapest forms of paid advertising out there. For very little money (think $5/day) you can get your ads in front of thousands of people.. even hundreds of thousands.</p>

<p>You can pay either per impression (per 1000 views) or you can pay per action (like a click on your ad). PPA is awesome because you are only paying for results and not just views on the ad.</p>

<p><strong>3. Market research made super easy.</strong>
Of course, running an ad or advertising anything at all anywhere is absolutely useless unless you know WHO you need to be advertising to.</p>

<p>Meaning, you need to know who your audience is and who to target with your ads. Is it women aged 22-45 with kids or men 35-42? You may think you know but you don't, unless you do your research.</p>

<p>Fortunately Facebook makes it incredibly easy to find that out and define your audience with a feature called Audience Insights.</p>

<p>Go to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/audience_insights" rel="nofollow">https://www.facebook.com/ads/audience_insights</a> and get ready to have your mind blown. (oh, and it's free)</p>

<p>So basically you can type in an interest, like "phone accessories" and it will tell you mind blowing information about people who like that interest.</p>

<p>For example, when I type in "Mophie" and "Otterbox" for the interest, it now tells me that Women aged 18-34 make up the majority of people who like that interest. It tells me that they are mostly single with a college education. It tells me what other categories, pages and interests they also like. It shows me a breakdown of where they are at geographically.. country, state, city, etc. It tells me they have an average income of $50-70k a year, and 41% of them make online purchases at a highly frequent rate.</p>

<p>This only scratches the surface. It tells you a LOT more. And you can target your ads based on all those factors.</p>

<p>So in conclusion.. yes, I think FB ads would be a great place to start</p>

<p>If you are creating your own brand, I would suggest that you sell the items through the stores like Amazon, etc.
However, if you are looking to retail other's goods through your own online store, then I would suggest that you use Adwords to promote your estore.</p>
