My company has produced some Android TV boxes. These are devices which plug into your TV and act as an android tablet. All google play applications can be installed. However , we have a lot of Chinese competition which is true for any hardware device.<br /> 
I was wondering what are the effective ways to promote this box and earn some revenue?

The following is what I have tried;

- Advertise on local newspaper
- Trying to set up stalls in apartment complexes
- TV advertisements seem to be too expensive
- Google adwords doesnt make much sense because of the market domain. I belive I would like to target distributors instead
- Talk to online streaming companies. 

I still havent been able to get orders for these boxes. How do you generally market a product without spending too much? Right now we have bought some standard enclosures but not deigned the mould. Would spending about 10000USD on a mould help?<br />
 If I have to make back all this money then I would have to sell atleast 200-300 pieces a month. 

How should I proceed?<br /> 
What are the ways I can get people to buy my product? <br />
How do I find which country to target?

In my opinion , the error is in your strategy. Before any marketing initiative , you need to know where will direct marketing. Make a good market research. You will find countless articles about it, and then focus on it.

For example , you started with local newspapers ? but before doing so , you found the local newspaper of the public is interested in your product ?

Start around. Set a niche and then think of strategies based on habits.

To find the person , start with a page land use google trends , and face ads . Any inexpensive tool and to provide you a return of who accesses .
