Accounting has nothing to do with break even analysis (BEA). Therefore VAT has NO influence on BEA.

Lets say you your own price for your product is 1000€/a, the tax rate is 20%, so you collect 1200€/a. You also invested 4000€ to start your venture and you will have costs of 600€/a.

VAT is collected by your startup and transferred to treasury (I hope that is the right term and usage) within a certain time frame. So your earnings per year are increased by 200€ and reduced by 200€ again.

The BEA shows a time span, in which you have more money **earned** then spend for your venture. So only the earnings influence BEA.

Also there is a difference. VAT collection and calculation is a task/number which represents the past, while Break Even Analysis is a tool to predict the future. You try to keep prediction tools simple. Mostly they don't display reality, but they make different approaches comparable!

Let's do our simple example without VAT: (BEP = Break Even Point)

0 = -4000 + (1000 - 600) * BEP
 
BEP = 10

Now with VAT:

0 = -4000 + (1200 - 600) * BEP - (1000 * 0,2) * BEP

BEP = 10

(Please be careful, this could be extended to any complexity and is not true for every case, example: interest business like banking or investment groups. But i hope you get the point)
