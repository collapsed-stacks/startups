We are in the process of starting a new company and we want to design a logo with a fruit, the problem is we don't know which fruit will be best for the job.

When people hear the word "Fruit", which fruit comes to mind most often?

I sincerely believe that it will depend on the locale and culture.  My first thought as would be apple.  That is the most prominent fruit in the Fruit of the Loom logo, grapes are the other fruit in that logo.  Meanwhile in other countries the banana, grapes, kiwi or even square watermelon could be the first thing that comes to mind.

Banana.

Cherries are pretty visual too, especially if there are 2 on a stem.
