I'm using Stripe Atlas for creating a new company in Delaware.
They ask me if I want:

- A new company, owned by individuals and investors
- A subsidiary of an already existing company

What is the pros & cons of a new company vs a subsidiary company?

It's not about advantages of one or the other, they're basically asking you if this is:

- A new business, in which case the future owners will own the new business.
- An existing business that is incorporating a new one in the US-DE (for any reason, including but not limited to opening a branch in the US), in which case the existing business will own the new business.

(There likely are some arcane and subtle tax-related differences too, but from a practical standpoint you shouldn't be worrying about those until you can afford an army of lawyers.)
