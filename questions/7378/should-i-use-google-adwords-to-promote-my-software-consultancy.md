I am starting up a software QA consultancy company. I am planning to use [Google AdWords][1]. I wanted to know how far it is useful for our kind of business. I am currently using freelancing websites, but building pipeline through freelancing websites is more difficult. I would like to know ROI for using Google AdWords for a software consultancy company. Is that really helpful at first place?

According to C.J. Hayden's book **Get Clients Now!** there are six primary strategies to market professional services (which a QA consultancy is):

 1. Direct Contact and Follow-up
 2. Networking & Referral Building
 3. Public Speaking
 4. Writing & Publicity
 5. Promotional Events
 6. Advertising

The **important point** is that number one (Direct Contact and Follow-up) is the most effective and number six (Advertising) is the least effective strategy to fill the pipeline.

Therefore **I would not go with ad-words** to promote a consultancy.

Start with your own web site and all the fee SEO stuff.  AdWords effectiveness is mixed.  Use some AdWords and see how it works.  The problem you are going to have is QC and Quality Assurance are such common terms.  Big players are the ones that fight over AdWords. 

I agree with the answer from from rmoestl +1.  Advertising is not that effective for consulting.  But still have a web site and use SEO.  Prospects will use the website as follow up after other contact.
