<p>We have the following clause on our proposals, when the client asks for source code ownership.</p>

<ul>
<li>Our company will assign source code ownership to client.</li>
<li>In exchange, our company will have the right of first refusal for the following services:

<ol>
<li>New deployment of the application</li>
<li>Modifications to the application</li>
<li>New modules for the application</li>
<li>Upgrade of hosting services</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<p>My intention is I want the client to ask us first for a proposal for the listed services and if we don't send a proposal within 10 business days, that's the only time they can talk to other providers. </p>

<p>Is the term "Right of First Refusal" applied there properly? Everywhere I read applies the term to real estate so I wasn't sure.</p>

<p>I add that clause in if the client isn't willing to pay for a source code surcharge and is asking for a "technical provider" partnership setup instead. Is there a better way to go about this setup? Signed MOAs/MOUs instead of including it in the project contract?</p>

<p>Right of first refusal is typically used to sell a thing rather than a project contract, and I don't think it works well for a project contract.</p>

<p>It sounds very demanding and that you want to unduly constrain the other person.  What if they find someone else 20% cheaper than you?  It doesn't make sense for them to have to use you.</p>

<p>You should price source code transfers such that there is no expectation of anything in the future.  You could do it differently and tell the customer they will get a 10% discount on future work to entice them to come back to you in the future.</p>
