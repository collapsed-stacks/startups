<p>Well, the question says it all.</p>

<p>I have this app idea since several months ago, but without a programmer background I had to start learning, so I did it for the past 3 months and now I just got a functional prototype in Android. The problem is that I also need it to be done in iOS, so I need an iOS developer but I would like him to be co-founder as right now I have been doing it solo.</p>

<p>What do you think I should do?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>a)</strong> Launch a super basic MVP publicly to get traction locally and with that get an iOS developer?</p>
  
  <p><strong>b)</strong> Launch my prototype publicly only for Android even though iOS has more market share?</p>
  
  <p><strong>c)</strong> Focus on friending an iOS developer and launch both versions? (If you answer yes to this, please tell me some hints to find one)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As additional info, I'm living in Monterrey, Mexico.</p>

<p>I would choose <strong>C)</strong> as I'll look on <em>LinkedIn</em> and other professional social network to find one.<br />
Make a movie of your Android app to demonstrate to him how it work and what's the point.<br />
And for sure tell him that you'll be associate.</p>

<p>It's how a start-up made with me ;)</p>

<p>Make a profile on websites like Angel.co and start looking for a co-founder to help you.</p>

<p>You can send requests to people depending on their profiles and they can send applications to you.</p>

<p>Prune and Select. </p>

<p>OK, I’m not sure how should've I answered this question so it wouldn’t be deleted. :) In my opinion, it’s a pretty straightworward answer if someone looking for a developer and I know where to find him. But probably my answer should be more general so I’ll try to give an answer on exact question.</p>

<p>I would say that in terms of an app it may be reasonable to test it on one platform before launching on another. As on the first stages you most likely will be changing your app a lot, so it would be tough to reflect all those changes on app for another platform.</p>

<p>The solution of this might be considering using tools that allow you to build cross-platform or partly cross-platform apps. There are things like Cordova/PhoneGap that allows you to build fully cross-platform apps without any code duplicating (however, those apps are not truly native as they’re based on a WebPage). Also there are tools that allow you to make a different UI parts for your apps but share the code of the core of your app (React Native, Xamarin). That would help you to avoid redundancies of development process, especially on the early stages when you have to be lightning fast with development of new features. And unlike PhoneGap it gives you a truly native experience.</p>

<p>But if considering not just developing an app, but creating a <em>product</em> or a <em>company</em>, I would say that having a cofounder is always a good thing. And I think that the most importance of this is not because you need someone to copy your code to the another platform, but because you need someone to discuss your ideas with; someone, who will support you in case you get in tough situations; someone who can share with you his experience in the things that you might not know very well.</p>

<p>So in summary, my opinion is that all cases you provided are reasonable, but in any case it’s not worth it just hanging out a year because you haven’t found a cofounder yet. Spend a few weeks trying to find him and if you don’t, just move on and try to launch an app yourself while continuing searching.</p>
