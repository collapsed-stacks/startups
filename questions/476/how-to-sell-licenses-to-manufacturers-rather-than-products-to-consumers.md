I'm working on a project and am starting to get some traction, having teamed up with a couple of other guys on it.

The concept is a rather simple vehicle accessory but the end goal would be to pitch it to existing car manufacturers in hopes that they would be interested in licensing the idea or patent and incorporating it directly into their vehicles.

How would this scenario be best approached?

We're nearing the end of concept and design and my goal is to have a fully functional prototype built and working in about a month.  What then?

Unless you have an "in" or are already known from some previous work that will need a very good sales pitch. Assumptions:

- you don't have any industry connections at manufactures that *might* be interested in your product.
- you don't have a massive budget
- you do have *some* prototypes of your product 

In which case what I would do:

- Firstly ensure that you have adequate legal protection - whether copyright or patent - before talking to anyone in the industry. Talking to an intellectual property specializing lawyer would probably be in your best interest.
- Research to figure out your **exact** target market: not vehicle manufactures but more like vehicle parts manufactures or luxury vehicle manufactures or better yet something like high end car division or cheap family vans.
- Choose two or thee companies/divisions that match your target market
- Research them and look for who would probably have some say but not be too important to talk to an unknown supplier (company directories on many corporate website can be a great help - as is a friendly secretary)
- Set up individual meetings and give them some of your prototype and get them to try it out or demonstrate it. (Exactly what you get them to do/give them of course depends on what you product is.)

I would organize a seminar on your product and invite all possible clients or their sales representatives. 

If you have money, organize 2-day seminar in a cool location offering them overnight sleep, good food and party and give them 1 or more samples to test it. It may be costly, but this is how the other companies do (Google I/O, Microsoft, etc.). 

Another way would be to find a "contact" in some of those companies and ask him to buy a few of your products and to convince the CEOs to start using them. After that, you can approach to other companies stating that ABC company is already using your product. This is also how large companies do. 

Since you are new and small, I would invest money in the seminar.
