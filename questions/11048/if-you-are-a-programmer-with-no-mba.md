What problems do you face while working on the tech business idea?

As a programmer **the notion of 'to be able to build stuff' might be exciting** and you might have business idea for App, providing a some kind of service or creating some kind of software product.
So what are the problems you face in the process of taking that idea and turning it into consistent stream of client's or to reach a point where you have more work than you can handle.
**What are the barriers,problems or things in your way to get your idea off the ground?**

There are just a few industries that require a specific education and or years of experience, in order to run the business. Some examples:

1) Financial institutions: you cannot head a financial institution (incl. online banks) without education in Finance and 8+ years of experience in the field(in Europe).

2) Pharmacy: you cannot own a pharmacy without a degree in Pharmacy; same goes for working in a pharmacy (in Europe).

3) Construction: you need an engineering degree for most of the management roles in construction.

Software service sounds broad, for ex. if it's a tool for companies to create reports - no education requirements for the founder; if it's a fintech solution then you need a co-founder with the respective degree + experience.

Best is to look into the legislation of the country the business is registered at.

I guess the problem that you are talking about is being able to get involved in a business being a programmer with no background in business administration.

First depending on where you live (USA ?) it is not required to have a degree to run most of the businesses. Honestly business is not that hard for not being able to self-educate yourself about.

Second, If you have ideas on an app or other stuff and you know how to put in place the app but not how to market it or supervise it financially then you can do what most programmers/engineers do which is to find a parter with an MBA or advanced business skills that could help you implement it.

Most of the times, even if you have an MBA you have to work with a partner with some countries because things work differently depending on where you are making business wordwide.

Third, If you want to catch up on business skills and don't know how to implement your idea perfectly there are methodologies in place on how to developp your ideas such as "Project Management" and "Business case exercices". If you are really motivated by your idea startups incubators help people with ideas to get on the right track. Some of them are part of universities or companies. 

The solution is yours !
