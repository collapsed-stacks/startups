<p>I asked some of my mentors and other people in the industry and yet <strong>I'm still sitting on the fence</strong>. I think that each option is equally valid, I think that regardless which option I choose it will be fine - I just want to maximise the opportunity </p>

<p>One of my mentors:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My experience with such big events is that  aluable people / speakers have a private longue and never come into contact with the crowd :)
  The quality of networking is inversely proportional to the number of participants.
  The only scenario in which it makes sense to go for me, is the moment when you have "startup for startups". Because they gather hundreds of companies out there, and you can sell.</p>

<h3>GO:</h3>

<ul>
<li>networking NETWORKING ne</li>
<li>€1000 ticket</li>
<li>£1000 in lost income <em>(contracting at the moment, will miss out 3 days at work)</em></li>
<li>flights are cheap, hostel is cheap, food is cheap <em>(I eat <a href="https://twitter.com/stefek99/status/656571390385090560" rel="nofollow">soylent</a> anyway)</em></li>
</ul>

<h3>STAY:</h3>

<ul>
<li>the saved money would allow me to sustain life for 2 months</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<ol>
<li>On the one hand: it’s expensive. </li>
<li>On the other hand: one deal, one job, one contact can easily convert into 10x return of investment.</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>Do you have any other considerations?</p>
