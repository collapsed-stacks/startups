<p>I have started a web design company. Now I need to hire part time / full time business development manger or marketing manger.</p>

<p>What I want to tell him that, get me at least 5000$ projects per month and you will get 20% commission. If you bring 5000$-10000$ projects per month you will receive 25% commission.</p>

<p>The problem is how I find that type of marketer?. Because marketing persons does not have web design knowledge. So how they do marketing and give quotations.</p>

<p>And how I prove that I am not scaming for marketers. I mean I have to give commission only client pay money for my company. How I prove that my marketer we take this project and we can't take this project or client is not interest our budjects, etc.</p>

<p>PS : I am in India and 5000$-->20% is 1000$. It is a very good income in India.</p>

<p>You could try using Freelancer.com or Upwork.com to initially test out the people you want to hire. Just let them know that you are also interested in finding a long-term employee in your hiring description.</p>

<p>Using freelancers first mitigates your risks of hiring someone.</p>

<p>Additionally, you can find web development gigs through those freelancer sites. They are good for earning some income as well as honing your skills on selling your web design skills. It is more difficult for someone else other than you to sell your own skillset.</p>

<p>You are not looking for a business development or marketing professional.  You are looking for a sales professional. And, soliciting for marketing or business development people is only going to cause problems sooner than later.  They are all different roles and different skills.</p>
