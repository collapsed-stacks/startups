I'm launching a startup in the USA, and am wanting to put together a few white papers on our product. Wistia, a business video hosting solution, has lots of research/data on video retention/engagement numbers. Would it be legal to use this data within my own white papers, as long as I cite the data source appropriately?

Yes, you can do this.  Intellectual property rights do not prevent you from using any public information or facts.  You don't even need to cite them, though it probably makes sense to do so.

Copying even short amounts of text from another white paper could be copyright infringement so make sure not to do that.

Also, there is some gray area about copying large compilations of facts (e.g., a phone book) but it doesn't sound like you are doing anything close to that.
