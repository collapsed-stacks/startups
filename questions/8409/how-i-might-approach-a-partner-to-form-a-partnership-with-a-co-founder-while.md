This is from Sri Lanka. Here is some background information about my question. - Me and my friend discussed and planned to start a business. I invested for everything we planned and he invested some money too. But his investment is insignificant for now and easily can be replaced by someone else. Mine cannot be replaced. He has promised to invest more in a month. I redesigned the business model in a way I can get investment from anywhere, because I'm not satisfied with his contribution as a partner.But didn't disclosed this to him. I registered the business as my sole one, before one week and still didn't disclose this to him.. For now I didn't incorporated the project because we still don't know if this will be successful and funds are not sufficient. He is not prompting to talk about the business registration too. He maybe willing to take the full ownership to himself. Maybe. Now I'm going to sign an agreement with another company. In that place I will have to give my business registration copy to them. It is possible that this company I'm signing agreement might leak that I already got the Business under my name. I know this may sound deceitful.

But if I didn't do this. He might have. Moreover, he didn't really contribute anything yet (replaceable investment).
