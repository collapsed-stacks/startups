<p>I have few contacts that I am in eventual deals for drop shipping and opening e-commerce websites based on their products. I have few very good offers, that are lets say IMHO too good to be true in some way. </p>

<p>So I would like to check out somewhere, if some database of companies located in China (Shenzhen) exists where I can verify by ID or their name their existence. Also does anybody have experience with such companies. In my case it is electronic companies producing laptops, tablets, smartphones etc. I have offers for American/European brands, and I suppose they are produced there. Also is it legal to drop ship brands that they offer that </p>

<p>I don't have direct agreement nor contact with actual brands. </p>

<p>Big NO. Try imagine you selling Apple products without Apple's permission.</p>
