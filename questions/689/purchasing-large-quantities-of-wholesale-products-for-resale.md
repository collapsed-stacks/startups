I am trying to start a business that deals with small machinery. I will need to be able to order these items in large quantities. However, every time I search for something like this, I cant seem to find anything that seems reputable. I always find too much stuff from amazon and the like. I am trying to build motorized bikes, and will need to have bikes, motors, gas tanks, etc in large amounts. I know that the prices I am seeing are unreasonable, because they don't come directly from manufacturers.

So my question is this: 

How can I find companies that will sell me LARGE amounts of very specific small machine parts for reasonable manufacturer prices? Is there a registry or some organization that could point me in the right direction?

The automotive industry is extremely well-organised, with very established channels and umbrella organisations.  Simply reading some of the trade press can help you to understand how the industry operates and identify potential partners; attending exhibitions and industry events can be a very good way of connecting with potential suppliers.

For example, here in the UK, the [Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders](http://www.smmt.co.uk/) maintains a searchable [online directory of automotive suppliers](http://www.autosupplierfinder.com/MotorIndustry) (free registration required) and run trade events at which suppliers can meet buyers; there also exist membership bodies such as the [Motorcycle Industry Association](http://www.mcia.co.uk/), through which you could contact  others who may be able to recommend or connect you with suitable suppliers.

Of course, UK-specific bodies may not be much use to you if you're not in the UK&mdash;but similar organisations undoubtedly exist throughout the world.

Finding good suppliers is a very important factors with value-added producers or resellers (though it is important for any business but service based businesses have a much smaller percentage of expenses in that category).

In some product categories there are lots of suppliers/wholesalers in others they are much less common. For example wholesale food suppliers there are probably a dozen large ones in any large metropolitan centre in North America; meanwhile wholesale tool suppliers will be much much less numerous. A lot of suppliers of perishable goods have local distribution centres or are wholely local whereas it is common for non-perishable suppliers to ship long distance. 

To find the right suppliers I would suggest two methods that I have found effective:

- Use others in a similar position's experience. by that I don't mean other start-ups but other businesses in your niche or something similar. Yes competition might exist but often they'll be helpful. For example in your case you could talk to a repair shop or similar and they might be able to help. They may also be willing to 'piggy-back' orders with minimal markup if it is large orders.
- Search using keywords such as `wholesale` or `supplier` - this includes phone books and internet.

Some things you can get at better prices direct from the manufacturers if you get big enough quantities at a time - and for this I only have one suggestion: get good at being friendly and try calling em up.
