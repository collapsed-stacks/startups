I'm working on developing a marketplace site where sellers advertise and sell items on the site in exchange for a transaction fee on credit-card sales. I think I've a pretty nice twist on the idea worked out and I'm looking for advice on how to handle the payment process. 
I know there's a ton of transaction companies out there for taking credit card payments directly to a business bank account but I'm looking for something that will send a percentage directly to me and the remainder to one of multiple bank accounts (ie the sellers) around the world. 
Skrill seem to have something like this. Any other options?

According to your need for credit card processing you have many options to go with. I am listing them below:

<ul>
<li><b>Using Paypal</b> - You can use Paypal to process the payments through credit cards. Paypal provides a set of powerful API to do the same.</li>

<li><b>Setup your own gateway</b> - An option of setting up your own gateway could be a more secure, reliable and faster way from processing the payments to receiving in the bank a/c. quickly instead of collecting in any type of online wallet. There are many websites out there who provide the easy setting up of Payment Gateway or you can also call up your bank as they can also help you setting up the Payment Gateway.</li>

<li><b>Netteller</b></li>

<li><b>Skrill</b></li>

<li>...etc.</li>

</ul>
