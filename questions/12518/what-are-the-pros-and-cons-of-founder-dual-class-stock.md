<p>It is not uncommon for companies that want to limit the decision making process through voting to have multiple classes of shares. </p>

<p>For example, "class A Ordinary" will be full voting shares, but "class B Ordinary" will have the same value from a purchase and dividend point of view, but not from the point of view of voting rights. It is very common in the UK within an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/tax-employee-share-schemes/enterprise-management-incentives-emis" rel="nofollow noreferrer">EMI Scheme</a> to do this sort of thing, where the founders of a business will have A class shares and the employees will be granted B class (non-voting) shares.</p>

<p>They are sometimes called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_share" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Golden Shares</a> to be exercised under certain conditions.</p>

<p>In a business founder situation, you would need to have some good reasons for a difference of voting rights. There are some very good articles on this site written around this issue</p>

<p>Pros</p>

<ul>
<li>If you have the super voting right shares, then you will probably control the company with fewer shares</li>
<li>You will have a smaller cut of the pie from a dividend point of view</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons</p>

<ul>
<li>With another person having the super voting rights shares, you will most likely lose control of the company</li>
<li>You will have a larger cut of the pie from a dividend point of view</li>
</ul>

<p>Other questions to consider</p>

<ul>
<li>Are these super shares able to be purchased at a premium cost?</li>
<li>How are they to be disposed of? i.e. do you have a shareholders agreement that specifies that the other party can only sell them back to the business and not to an outside party?</li>
<li>What is the basis of these super shares being offered/taken? Is it more equity, time, ideas, ip or other resource provided up front to equalise the relationship</li>
<li>Be careful that the other founding parties in the relationship do not feel like minority shareholders, otherwise, you will have business partners that are not engaged in making the business succeed</li>
</ul>

<p>You should perhaps get some legal advice on this with regard to your right to control the business. </p>
