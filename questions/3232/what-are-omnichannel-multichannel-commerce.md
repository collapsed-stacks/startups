<p>It's usually jargon for serving (and ideally tracking) a user across multiple (multi-) or all (omni-) channels: offline, web store, social media, mobile, direct mail, telesales, etc. (I haven't watched the video, but that would be my guess at what he means.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Multichannel retailing is the use of a variety of channels in a customers shopping experience including research before a purchase. Such channels include: retail stores, online stores, mobile stores, mobile app stores, telephone sales and any other method of transacting with a customer. Transacting includes browsing, buying, returning as well as pre and post sale service.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Omni-Channel Retailing is the evolution of multi-channel retailing, but is concentrated more on a seamless approach to the consumer experience through all available shopping channels, i.e. mobile internet devices, computers, brick-and-mortar, television, radio, direct mail, catalog and so on. Retailers are meeting the new customer demands by deploying specialized supply chain strategy software. To use all channels simultaneously, retailers using an omni-channel approach will track customers across all channels, not just one or two.</p>
