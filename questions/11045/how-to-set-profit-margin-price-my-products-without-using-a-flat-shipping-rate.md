<p>I am launching an online shop that sells a variety of handmade crafts, using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_shipping" rel="nofollow">Drop Shipping</a> method.
I am having a big difficulty adding my profit margin and setting final prices since I have a wide range of product types and vendor prices, and a wide range of shipping costs depending on the weight/size of the item and where the item is going to be shipped to.</p>

<p>Not wanting to set a flat rate for the shipping around the globe, and with a lot of variables like this, how to set the final price of the products?</p>
