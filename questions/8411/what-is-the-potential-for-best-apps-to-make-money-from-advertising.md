Here are a few things I've gathered recently, and my terminology might not be to the point, but here it goes:

 - Quality/Quantity of user sessions: How long is the user using your app? Are they in it long enough to give the ad a chance to load? How many different ads can you present them during one session? How many users are using the app?
 - Ad-mediation: If your app is popular enough, you can certainly have some leverage to become part of a certain ad-mediation network. That pays more because you have a target audience.  If you have an app that shows Mexican restaurants in your area, then that's a perfect ad spot for a Mexican restaurant to advertise in, and they would likely pay the ad-mediation network more, because their advertising dollars aren't spent on showing an ad to someone seeking for medical advice in a medical app.
