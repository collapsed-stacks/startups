<p>Newbie here. We are a group of software developers looking to start a company , but the thing is we agreed not to register yet until we nail and deliver to around 5 clients. my question is, is there such a thing as an online software provider? (Virtual office, no physical space) and is it common practice that people market themselves under a company name even before registering it legally? </p>
