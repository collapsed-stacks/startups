 I'm a Full Stack Developer with years of experience as a full time employee and consultant at the same time. 
 So my question is, where can I find a business person, with a good idea to develop as "startup mode" (no salary until you get funding, and usually a low salary afterward).
 In other words, someone to build a partnership with.
 Thanks

There's no shortage of "idea guys" looking for a developer cofounder on the likes of cofounderslab, angelist, and other cofounder matching sites.

Be wary as you shop around however. For every great idea with great potential business execution out there, there's a ton of not so great ideas or worse, and a ton of good ideas with _terrible_ business execution. Prefer a cofounder who has done their homework a bit by actually probing their future market before looking for a partner. The closer they are to having hot leads lined up, the more likely their idea and business execution will be good.

I think that the best way to find a business partner is "offline". If your plan is to build a partnership and create a startup, the first impression, the first feeling that you have towards a business partner is very important, even more important than the idea itself because you will invest time, knowwledge and money and you need to be on the same page. There are many startup events in every city: usually at the pitching events, there are lots of business people looking for developers (for personal experience, there are always more business people than developers). There are founders meet-up, VCs networking events and similar. THE MOST IMPORTANT SUCCESS FACTOR TO FOUND THE RIGHT CO-FOUNDER IS **NETWORKING**: you need to know people and let others know about you to find the ideal match with the person and the idea. It takes a bit of time but it will give you the results rather than just searching online. 
Business people like to talk vis-a-vis!

You know, you'd be surprised at what you'll find when you look at Craigslist and hunt around.  I found several consulting gigs that way with people who needed code written and had no idea how to find someone.
Another good source can sometimes be other local consulting firms.  You can always call and ask if they know of any startup business that is willing to trade equity for code work.

Hope this helps.

Good luck!
