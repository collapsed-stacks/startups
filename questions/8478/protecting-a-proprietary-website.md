If I build a website and don't want anyone to copy, modify it, etc. But I do want it to be used as a product or service, what can I do to protect myself from people copying it etc?

For example if I were to build a job board web business.

Is there a license that I need to declare or something similar?

<p>There are a number of licenses you can use, but without knowing the exact nature it's hard to say which is best. Luckily, there's a really neat tool in <a href="http://creativecommons.org/choose/" rel="nofollow">the Creative Commons site</a> that asks you a few questions - depending on your answers, it selects a good license for you.</p>

<p>As an example, let's say you're building a blog website with tutorials or guides you want to protect. If you do not want to allow adaptations to be used or have your works used commercially (aside from yourself), then you'd be looking for the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/" rel="nofollow">Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.</a></p>

A license gives other people the rights to use your content so you don't want that. I suggest reading about copyright: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright

Note that you obtain copyright protection automatically (at least in the US) just by publishing (e.g., on a website) your work.  Best to put a "(C) 2016 Company Name" in the footer of your website.  Also a good idea to explicitly state in your terms and conditions that people can't copy the content of your website.
