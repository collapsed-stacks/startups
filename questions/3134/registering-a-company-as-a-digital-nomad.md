<p>I am a digital nomad, so I don't have a fixed residence or address. I have Spanish passport.</p>

<p>I need to register a company for my start-up, what is the best country to do this? Is it possible to register a company online in some country that also allows registering a company in a virtual address or PO box?</p>

<p>Having a low tax, good data protection laws and being cheap to register are good things to have too.</p>

<p>Probably not the answer you're looking for, and IANAL, but...</p>

<p>Look... I lived in a few countries, and I've met a bunch of others who did the same as you're looking into while traveling around. Some of them felt invincible and paid dearly for it.</p>

<p>So don't delude yourself.</p>

<p>By registering a company in a tax haven, you expose yourself to a taxman in a country where you're not living, and that taxman will eventually and invariably ask where you're paying your personal taxes when wondering if there's anything more to collect.</p>

<p>If you're not paying or not planning to pay the latter anywhere, as your question seems to imply ("no fixed residence or address"), then you'll be in for trouble because your being a perpetual traveler is something taxmen and courts have very little sympathy for.</p>

<p>If you do pay it somewhere, you stand to have a taxman at your door asking where your revenue comes from. You'll then need to justify why your company is in some other country with little to no taxes, and you'll get fined for tax evasion.</p>

<p>Either way, it's not pretty. And the question is when rather than if. It's simply not worth it.</p>

<p>So... register your company and pay your taxes where you plan to come often (presumably Spain, to see your family), pay your retirement contributions, and call it a day.</p>

<p>With all that being sad, here's a list of <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_haven" rel="nofollow">tax havens</a> to actually answer your question. Check with a lawyer for the gory details, as this stuff is subject to arbitrary changes each year.</p>
