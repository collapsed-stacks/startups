<p>Broadly, non-profits get income four ways.</p>

<p>First, they may <strong>ask for donations from supporters</strong>. This is probably what most of us think of first, especially for non-profits that have genuinely and explicitly charitable purposes. This kind of non-profit scales its operations according to donations.</p>

<p>Second, they may <strong>get income from assets held for that purpose</strong>. In my jurisdiction, most non-profits (numerically) have this as their sole or primary source of income. Such a nonprofit will probably have relatively stable income year by year, which may be modest (as for instance when the assets were given centuries ago), or substantial (some museums, for instance).</p>

<p>Third, they may <strong>contract with third parties to deliver services</strong>. Many nonprofits that exist to benefit particular groups - for instance people with a particular medical condition - become involved in service delivery where some or all of the funding comes from governments, NGOs and others.</p>

<p>Fourth, they may <strong>carry out "profitable" activities</strong>. "Profitable" gets the quote marks because, depending on the jurisdiction, such activities may fall outside what is allowed of non-profits. So you will often find legal entities that exist to plug the gap. So a non-profit may have an associated for-profit company that donates profits. Some jurisdictions have hybrid corporate forms to help smaller organizations avoid the administrative and cost burden.</p>

<p>Grants and fundraising are how most non-profits raise funds.</p>

<p>I'm consider non-profit in your case those companies who provide services / product for free for some cause, then </p>

<ul>
<li>Advertisment </li>
<li>Support</li>
<li>Donations </li>
</ul>

<p>Mozilla (sort of) follows advertisment model having Google as primary search now Yahoo. They paid 6Billion because of "the reach to target audience" FireFox has.</p>

<p>Ubuntu used to sell support for their servers.</p>

<p>Wikipedia and other non-profit go about with the help of awesome people donating to the cause.</p>

<p>The business models can get really complicated if dug deep into them but this should answer your question if keeping things simple.</p>
