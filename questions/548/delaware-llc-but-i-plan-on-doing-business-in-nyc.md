<p>I have a Delaware LLC, but I currently live in the NYC area because of my full time job. The LLC was created before I ever got to NYC. What I am trying to do is figure out whether I should get rid of my Delaware LLC and create an NYC LLC or just register my LLC to do business in NYC (while having a virtual office)? Which one is better and why?</p>

<p>Believe this is the analysis that you're looking for, <a href="http://www.chadbourne.com/files/Publication/7544b5f5-276b-4e41-ba34-c2c398823e9c/Presentation/PublicationAttachment/bca2f303-8819-4791-980f-cb57790b0ba5/July2009_Law.comArticle.pdf" rel="nofollow">Practical Considerations for Forming LLCs in New York and Delaware</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At first blush, LLC formation in New York seems costlier than in
  Delaware, and Delaware has certain other advantages. As stated above,
  I often advise my clients to form in Delaware, determine next where
  they will be "doing business" and proceed to qualify their entity in
  those jurisdictions. This is not the lowest-cost approach, but does
  provide the best protection of the laws.</p>
  
  <p>Although New York's fees are higher than Delaware's, a foreign LLC
  doing business in New York will not be able to avoid the fees by
  forming their business outside of New York State. An LLC's members
  will also be taxed according to the location of income-earning
  activities, so forming outside of New York to avoid tax will not
  achieve the desired effect.</p>
  
  <p>A foreign LLC doing business in Delaware, on the other hand, does not
  have to register until it needs to bring suit. The LLC must pay back
  fees, however, and an additional $200 for each year of doing business
  without registration. Delaware's taxes similarly apply to LLCs based
  upon the location of the income-earning activity.</p>
  
  <p>One wishing to form an LLC at lowest cost should therefore look first
  to where its business activities will occur; if the LLC will do
  business in only one state, then it should form in that state. If New
  York is chosen, the county named in the articles of organization will
  be the county where publication will take place and this choice will
  impact the publication costs. In the event an LLC will be doing
  business in multiple locations, it is generally my recommendation that
  the entity be formed in Delaware and qualified in the appropriate
  jurisdictions based on the relevant jurisdiction's doing business
  test.</p>
