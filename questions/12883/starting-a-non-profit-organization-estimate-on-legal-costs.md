<p>I am just trying to find a good estimate of the legal costs of incorporating a not for profit organisation that is likely not tax exempt.</p>

<p>This Non-Profit will handle the social media public face for an online organisation - that is the best way I can describe it. Basically, we will be the social media wing of a Decentralised Autonomous Organization (or DAO).</p>

<p>Legal Zoom seems very cheap at $350, but I kind of want to talk to a lawyer and employing an accountant.</p>

<p>The organisation will have two employees, generate no sale/revenue aside from donations for the operation of the organisation.</p>

<p>Starting a non-profit in the U.S. is fairly easy, and you don't need a lawyer.  You do this under state law so just go to the Secretary of State website for your state and find the instructions for creating a non-profit. Costs are likely less than $100.</p>

<p>You may have other obligations.  In Massachusetts, a non-profit seeking donations needs to register with the state Attorney General as well.  There are a lot of state-specific guides out there so you should Google for one that is specific to your state.</p>

<p>The 501(c)(3) is more complicated but you say you don't want that.</p>

<p>You'll need to file annual tax forms so you'll probably want an accountant for that.</p>
