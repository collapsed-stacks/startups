<p>I have a new employee joining the company, (my first employee!)</p>

<p>As I have other agreements in place with other companies, I will need the person to sign an Non Disclosure Agreement.</p>

<p>Are there any standard NDA's that people use when employees join a company?</p>

<p>You need an employment agreement that the employee signs.  This is a standard practice for companies in the US.</p>

<p>The employment agreements generally covers confidentiality and ownership of intellectual property among other things.  If you Google "employment agreement", you'll find lots of examples online.</p>

<p>A corporate lawyer will have a general NDA form for cheap, shouldn't cost more than 30 minutes of their time, which even for a good lawyer should only be $200. </p>

<p>You will be able to use this NDA in the future multiple times, it is definitely worth it to have a legitimate lawyer create it. </p>

<p>That said, why even get an NDA if you cannot afford one, since <em>enforcing</em> the NDA will cost thousands if not more, and months if not years in order to recoup any proven losses.</p>

<p>Hire trustworthy employees, use obscurity with your trade secrets or sensitive proprietary material; even with an NDA in place.</p>

<p><code>Non-Disclosure Agreements</code> or <code>Confidentiality Agreements</code> are one part of the agreement between you and your new employee.</p>

<p>From a quick Google, and I have no affiliation with this site at all, I found this template <a href="https://media.everynda.com/pdf/sample-non-disclosure-agreement-template.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://media.everynda.com/pdf/sample-non-disclosure-agreement-template.pdf</a></p>

<p>There is a lot of information on that site, including:</p>

<h2>The basics of the agreement</h2>

<p>The basic elements of these contracts are normally present in most boilerplate forms. However, you still want to check your forms for them as people tend to overlook the obvious. These fields include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Names of the parties involved</li>
<li>Explanation or definition of what is considered confidential
information</li>
<li>Who owns or holds the information</li>
<li>Why the disclosure to the signing party is necessary (e.g. mention of
a specific project or circumstances such as a vendor relationship)</li>
<li>An explanation indicating that in return for signing the form, the
information is made available to that party</li>
<li>A restriction against use of the information except for the purposes
described in the agreement</li>
<li>Limits on what type of information is considered confidential</li>
<li>Remedies in the case of a breach</li>
</ul>
