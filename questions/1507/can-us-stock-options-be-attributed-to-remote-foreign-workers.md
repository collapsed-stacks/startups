Under what legal conditions (if any) can US startups issue stock options / RSUs to remote foreign workers? What are the limitations that may exist?

[This other question](https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/523/are-there-any-legal-issues-when-hiring-remote-workers) has an answer that mentions C-Corps, but it's not particularly specific.

With the typical fistful of IANAL pepper: no limitations.

A stock-option or other is a security, no more, no less. If you can trade a US security in your employee's country on a regulated exchange, you can allocate them to employees.

An exception might be embargoed States such as Cuba or Iran, presumably; but you're not allowed to employ offshore workers over there anyway.
