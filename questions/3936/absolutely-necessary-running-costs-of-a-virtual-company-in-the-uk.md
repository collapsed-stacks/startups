<p>If you create a ltd. what are the costs that cannot be avoided, even if you do not perform any business with the company?</p>

<p>How much cost to create it?</p>

<p>And, specially, how much does it cost each year to run it? What legal obligations does the company have, that cost money? does it need to have a telephone line? A real address where official letters can be send?</p>

<p>Does it cost anything to close it?</p>

<p>I am interested in the UK, but maybe an answer for the US would be useful for other users.</p>

<p>There is <a href="https://www.gov.uk/browse/business/limited-company" rel="nofollow">good information on the gov.uk site on what is involved in setting up and running a UK Ltd company</a>:</p>

<p>AFAIK the unavoidable costs are:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/limited-company-formation/register-your-company" rel="nofollow">Company House registration fee</a> (one off) £15 </li>
<li>You need a UK postal address as registered offices</li>
<li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/running-a-limited-company/company-annual-return" rel="nofollow">Fill in your annual returns</a> (It costs £13 to send online)</li>
<li>Obviously pay your taxes.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are companies who would register a company there and let you use their address temporarily. I registered a company a few years ago and it cost about $300 using a uk registration agent. I see that <a href="http://www.fastincorp.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fastincorp.co.uk/</a> does registrations for a lot cheaper and they give you an address on some of their plans. </p>
