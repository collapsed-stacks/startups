<p>I have a game with 3 lvls: </p>

<pre><code>- 1: press 1 button
- 2: press 2 buttons
- 3: press (you guess) 3 buttons
</code></pre>

<p>lvl 1 is free, the full version which contains all lvls and ad free is 1$</p>

<p>From google analytics I know half of the users installed the game deinstalled it directly (don't know why, maybe because of the cost?). Today, I got 2 feedbacks, which said, they dislike it since you can only play 1 lvl. (I got much more positive feedback, but I want to take care of the negatives too).</p>

<p>Now, if I will set lvl 1 &amp; 2 for free, I think the users will know whats coming in lvl 3 (He will think"aah 1 button in lvl 1, 2 buttons in lvl 2, and 3 in lvl3"), and they won't buy it, because it's no more a secret as it is now. </p>

<p>But on the other side, maybe more players will keep the game because they can do more with it..?</p>

<p>What should I do?</p>

<p>I don't know if this is a question of <strong>"how much"</strong>, but rather <strong>"why would someone want to pay you?"</strong>. </p>

<p>I remember a while back there was a game that had a free trial that was 1 level, which was a lot of fun. I really loved the game, but rather than pay for the game to get more levels I just replayed the 1st level over &amp; over &amp; over again until I got bored with the game and then found another free trial to play. It wouldn't have mattered if there was 1/2 of a level or 3 levels. I wasn't going to pay for the game with so many other free options to spend my time on.</p>

<p>Nowadays the only games that I purchase are the extremely cheap games (Doodle Jump for $1), games that are super hyped (GTA V for $60), or free-trial games that I get hooked on usually with a cliff-hanger ending to the trial (i.e. <a href="https://www.telltalegames.com/thewolfamongus/" rel="nofollow">"The Wolf Among Us"</a> which is an awesome game for $25).</p>

<p>Another type of game that I "pay" for are games with Ads. I don't personally give the developer money, but I'll sit through a 10 second ad to get to the next level (i.e. "RETRY") or to make another turn (i.e. "Words with friends"). The developer usually gets a penny or two for every viewing, which can be quite profitable.</p>

<p>Additionally, the "freemium" game is very popular amongst game makers though the morality of that sort of business plan is debatable. I don't contribute to games like this, but I do play them if they're fun w/o purchasing anything.</p>

<h2>Some suggestions</h2>

<ul>
<li>Put together some realistic projections using other games similar to yours to see what method would net you the most given your resources.</li>
<li>If you're already committed to the free trial, then add something to give the customer a reason to keep going. Maybe they'll lose their save if they don't buy or they won't find out what happens to their beloved character.</li>
<li>If you're just looking for some spare change rather than funding your operation, then consider donations through something like <a href="https://pledgie.com/" rel="nofollow">Pledgie</a></li>
</ul>

<p>There's no single formula, but there are patterns that can be effective.</p>

<p>I think what I'd try is to <strong>make the game ad-free, give unlimited use at level one, limited use with a daily time allowance at level two (until the user pays the upgrade), and reward shares with time at level three</strong>. Here's my thinking.</p>

<p>If it's paying users you're targeting, then unless you have some per-app cost, <strong>new level one users are a no regret event for you</strong>. So don't pollute the ux, just give them a taste of levelling up.</p>

<p><strong>Users who will never pay may be marketing vectors to others who might.</strong> So use the same mechanic, just boosted to the top level, to promote sharing. Assuming you're tracking user performance, help the share to become a <em>challenge</em> wherever that's possible (for instance, "I've survived thirty seconds at level 3. Beat that!" or "I'm a hero at level one and a zero at level 3. Help!"). I might buy an app that my friend paid for, and <strong>if the way I got introduced to the app implies I may be a paying user, that can oil the wheels of commerce</strong>.</p>

<p>If that works, you have several directions to push on, and if it doesn't, try another approach.</p>
