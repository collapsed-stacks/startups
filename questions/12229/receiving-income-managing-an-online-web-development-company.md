I have recently launched an online web development company for charging clients/customers for services ranging from building them web sites, web crawler scripts, opensource tools,etc etc. I've already deployed the site on Heroku and got a custom domain name; however I'am still stuck on how I will receive income from client/customer since this will be my first time starting a business.

I know I could integrate paypal on my site, but sometimes a client may want something custom at a non-fixed rate. So I figured issuing customer an invoice after speaking with them would be the best option.


Basically my question is....what is the typical way a online startup web design/development would issue a statement of payment to customer? 



I will be doing all the accounting myself, taxes, and i have already drafted bylaws and filed for name and articles of incorporation. Since this is a sole proprietor(which i plan to convert to an LLC in future when I grow), would I need to get some type of seller permit? or not since I'am online selling a service from my home online?

The question is really interesting and needs to consider it really as the initial pitching stone!

From the description of your work, I understood that you will be delivering your customers as service and for this, I suggest not to state fixed amount on the website. Instead, you may consult the customer, collect the requirements and **sent them an invoice**. Start the development after receiving an advance of 40% or a fixed percentage that you prefer. On completion of development, complete the payment and sent the receipt after each payment via mail.

The payment can be done by any means like PayPal or direct bank transfer or whatever means that you and your customer is comfortable with. But follow the method of *invoicing and keeping the receipts*.
