<p>Does anyone know the typical equity for someone who has an idea for a company BUT does not know how to reduce his or her product and/or service to practice? </p>

<p>For example s/he has an idea for a company to sell a chemical solution that does XYZ, but the s/he is not a chemist</p>

<p>Another example s/he has the idea for the business where people use a software program that performs a special algorithm, but s/he is not a software engineer, nor an algorithm designer, etc...</p>

<p>So s/he would need to recruit talent to actually make the idea a reality. Presumably the talent would be paid cash and/or equity to make the business possible</p>

<p>It depends on the context. It could be anywhere between zero ("Cool idea. But what do YOU bring to the table?") and half (if they tackle everything non-technical), or even more (if they hire gullible youngsters who have no idea of what they're worth).</p>
