I have looked around on the web to find a website where I can get guidance on how to build a software product. A community where I can get tips on how to marked my product. Where I can test my idea and get in touch with other people in the same situation. Even find co-founders. Do such a website exist? Or something similar?

<p>There is a host of these kinds of sites and communities out there. I am most familiar with the bootstrapped SaaS / Indie Hackers ecosystem, rather than the venture funded space.</p>

<p>Take a look at this talk on the ideal characteristics of a bootstrapped business to determine if this is the kind of business you are looking for <a href="https://vimeo.com/74338272" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://vimeo.com/74338272</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I would start off with '<a href="http://www.startupsfortherestofus.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Startups for the rest of us</a>', a podcast by two successful SaaS entrepreneurs, they also host a conference on bootstrapped SaaS businesses called '<a href="http://www.microconf.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">microconf</a>' (where the talk I linked to above was given) and a membership site for SaaS founders called '<a href="https://www.foundercafe.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">FounderCafe</a>'</p></li>
<li><p>The next one-stop-shop I'd recommend is <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.indiehackers.com</a> which presents examples of successful, mostly solo founder run software businesses, as well as a podcast and forum.</p></li>
<li><p>Read the <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1502472392" rel="nofollow noreferrer">'7 Day Startup'</a> by Dan Norris and join the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/592264044218722/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">open facebook group</a></p></li>
<li><p>Amy Hoy and Alex Hillman run a popular course on starting a software business called 30x500 which also includes an alumni forum that counts many successful entrepreneurs among its members, their <a href="https://stackingthebricks.com/products/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">free material is excellent as well</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>That should be enough to get you oriented in the space.</p>
