I have a product, which I am about to release: a web app. How can I get business customers to buy it in the beginning? I have two customers who will spread the word (hopefully).

How does Google ads work for specific customers group and new, small products?

I do not want to go around forums spamming with links.

If you want to get first customers just after release, the easiest way might not be by just going online. I guess that it is easier in today's word to directly go online but if your web app is not well referenced or the concept is not clear, the best option is first to reach the customer directly.

If you are aiming B to B, one easy approach would be to make a list of the companies around you that you think might be interested in your product and make the move to contact them (phisically is always better) and present them your project and to what extent it could help them. 

Once you have reached a certain amount of that kind of customers and they are satisfied with the product, your product will grow in popularity and thus it will be more visible online. 

What you can also do is to join a conference or a forum and (even without exposing) pitch your product to the attendees.

Getting your first customers is never an easy process and there are several ways to do it, but it is often slow to start. 

To my mind google ads is something you might want to use later on but not as your business just started.

I am a fan of PR. It costs less than people think. Help with the process by making a list of businesses you think would be "low-hanging fruit": businesses that would probably be more eager to buy your web app than others. Provide this to your PR person/firm and have them do their public relations magic to contact the firms regarding the availability and benefits of your web app.

Your PR person/firm might also write up press releases to distribute to sites / blogs / magazines that your customers read. You can help the process by researching the sites, blogs and magazines that are popular for your customers, so that you can provide that list to the PR person/firm (to save them time and to save you money).
