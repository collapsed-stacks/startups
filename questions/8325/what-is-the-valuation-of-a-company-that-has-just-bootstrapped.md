<p>How is a lower bound value of an early stage startup calculated; that has an I.P. value worth <code>V$</code> and the founders are starting to work on a vesting period of <code>4 years</code>?</p>

<p>Since there can be many factors, It will be useful to have an answer in context of the following:</p>

<h3>Scenario</h3>

<p>3 founders, <code>A</code>, <code>B</code> and <code>C</code> have created an IP of value <code>V$</code>. They left jobs worth <code>100K</code> per annum. per person. Assuming founder's stock will vest over a 4 year period (annually). Neglecting value of synergy between founders. i.e. assuming <code>1+1+1=3</code></p>

<p>Net salary liability is assumed to be <code>250K</code> per annum for 4 years for the purpose of my question. Other operational liabilities at <code>25K</code> per annum.</p>

<p><strong>P.S.</strong><br>
If there are factors that I have missed, then it would be nice to list those factors. I understand valuations are confusing and have several hidden factors. Given the information in this scenario is it possible to come up with an estimate?</p>

<p>I will give it a try, but this is only harsh university gibberish:</p>

<p>There are a few points which really mater, while evaluating startups:</p>

<ol>
<li>Market: Is the market attractive (for your investor)? Do other VCs or investors already invest into that market? Think of it as competition.</li>
<li>Reputation of the founder: how experienced are you guys in founding a company? have you already failed (and thats a good thing, because you already experienced this process)</li>
<li>Innovation and security: How strong does your product differs from previous approaches? Are you guys able to secure or patent your idea?</li>
<li>Traction and scaleabilty: How does your customer group adept your product? How many users do you have? how strong are you growing per invested $?</li>
<li>revenues and proof of concept: Have you even sold a unit? Do you reach your own goals, so your further prediction are more valid?</li>
</ol>

<p>Thing is: I can't tell you how to rate your company this way, but least, if you can answer these questions in a profound way, you will have bright future.</p>

<p>Normally, the investor rates you on your pitch and these questions.</p>

<p>I also found this link, but i can't tell you how reliable it is:</p>

<p>Valuation is often an art rather than science, and it is especially true in this kind of situation.</p>

<p>There is no formula that you can plug numbers into to get an answer.  Instead, you need to look at the product, the market, the founders, etc. and make a prediction of where the company will be in a year.</p>

<p>Your previous or current salaries are not very relevant to determining valuation.  Many highly paid people would be terrible founders. :)</p>
