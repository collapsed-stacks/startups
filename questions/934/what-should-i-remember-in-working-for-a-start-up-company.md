I'm thinking of joining a start up company coming from a big firm. I haven't seen the complete salary and benefit package.  I don't know much about the industry but it is interesting. I want to learn about startups and the industry so that I have enough knowledge to successfully start my own business in this industry.

What aspects should I be aware of that will be different working for a startup as opposed to an established firm?

This is **very** broad and general because corporate cultures have a vast range both in startups and in stable-established businesses. Everything I'm listing here could be applicable to any type of business but there is a general trend for startups to *more often have* this kind of situation; but definitely most of them are not unique to startups.

- Startups may have lower cash flow and hence early employees are often paid in a combination of stock/options and a below market pay rate. 
- Startups often have expectation (especially for early employees) of really stepping up to make it work and possibly working more than 40 hour weeks - yes any business can have deadlines but Startups often have tight funding deadlines.
- There may be more softness in job descriptions; like (for a tech startup) a programmer may be expected to interact with clients much more in a startup situation than an established stable business with large sales  or customer services departments.
- Related to the above three; startups often really suit a go-getter type personality much better than a clock punching type.
