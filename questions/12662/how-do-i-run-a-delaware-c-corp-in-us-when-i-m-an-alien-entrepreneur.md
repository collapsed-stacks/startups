<p>I have already incorporated a Delaware C-Corp in US. I can apply for H1B visa and run the company from US. But it requires to give up my company control. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In general, a valid employer-employee relationship is determined by
  whether the U.S. employer may hire, pay, fire, supervise or otherwise
  control the work of the H-1B worker.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm not interested in giving up my board control. </p>

<p>So i'm planning to setup parent office in US and make a subsidiary in home country.</p>

<p>Can I issue salary myself in my home country and then visit US to run my parent company on a Business visa (B1)? </p>
