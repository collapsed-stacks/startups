I have already incorporated a Delaware C-Corp in US. I can apply for H1B visa and run the company from US. But it requires to give up my company control.

I'm not interested in giving up my board control. 

So i'm planning to setup parent office in US and make a subsidiary in home country.

Can I issue salary myself in my home country and then visit US to run my parent company on a Business visa (B1)?
