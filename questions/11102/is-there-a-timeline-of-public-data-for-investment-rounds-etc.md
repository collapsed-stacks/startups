<p>I've been looking at CrunchBase to view the investment timeline of various startups - however I am more interested in seeing the equity totals.</p>

<p>Short of Googling public companies - is there any way to find out how much equity founders gave up in exchange for capital? I am guessing that valuations for private companies is like asking a magician to explain a magic trick, but I figured I would ask anyway :)</p>

<p><strong>It's not magic, it's just a question of public reporting requirements.</strong> Though details may vary among jurisdictions, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_company" rel="nofollow">Public companies</a> are required to disclose a tremendous amount of information whenever they raise capital. There are considerably fewer disclosure requirements for private companies. In fact, there are often no disclosure requirements.</p>

<p>As an example, all the financing deals of the public American corporation <a href="https://investor.fb.com" rel="nofollow">Facebook, Inc.</a> can be found on the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?CIK=0001326801" rel="nofollow">Securities and Exchange listing for Facebook</a>. Specifying form <code>S-1</code> will list <a href="https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?CIK=0001326801&amp;type=s-1" rel="nofollow">Facebook's IPO documents</a> (with all amendments), which is one of several documents that will detail <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalstructure.asp" rel="nofollow">capital structure</a>. Specifying other <a href="https://www.sec.gov/forms" rel="nofollow">forms</a> will show you the details of other financing deals. You can search for other public corporations required to provide reporting in the United States using <a href="https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/webusers.htm" rel="nofollow">SEC Edgar</a>.</p>

<p>Private corporations are not required to disclose the same level of detail as public corporations must because there isn't as much of a regulatory need for such detailed information. Any reporting requirements would be determined by the jurisdiction in which a company was incorporated. Facebook, Inc. being incorporated in the US State of Delaware disclosed significant capital structure details prior to its IPO. In 2009 when still a private company, <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/storage-gc/FB_ArticlesOfIncorp_10thAmendment.pdf" rel="nofollow">Facebook filed its 10th amendments to their Articles of Incorporation</a> with the State of Delaware which contain some capital structure information. You can get filings by other corporations in Delaware (or other states) for a fee from the state entity responsible for corporate filings.</p>

<p>Any other details about deals have to be released by someone with access to the information. Venture capitalists often release details to the media and to source like CrunchBase as a method of marketing this business and as a way to increase interest in their investments. Even though news reports and crunch base are generally reliable, there is nothing that forces them to be accurate like filings with a government entity like a state of the SEC.</p>
