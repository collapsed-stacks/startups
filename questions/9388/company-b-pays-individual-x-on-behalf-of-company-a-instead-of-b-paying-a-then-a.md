<p>Company A is in Ireland.  Company B is in America.  Company A does work for Company B and receives regular payments from B.  Company A has need to pay an individual X a per diem allowance while X is in America.  Company B pays X directly (on behalf of A) and subtracts that amount from the regular payments to A.</p>
