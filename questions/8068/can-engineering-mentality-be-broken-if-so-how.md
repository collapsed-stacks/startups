<p>People say if you are going to start a startup kill the engineer inside of you. That is true you have to do that. We have managed to do that to some degree.</p>

<p>But can it be totally killed? Can an engineer truly become a man who thinks from the social perspective? Or will the engineer keep living inside the person?</p>

<p>If so how can it be killed and how much time will it take?</p>

<p>There is a very good book on this particular subject called "The E-Myth" by Michael E. Gerber</p>

<p>However, he does not recommend to kill the engineer (or technician as he puts it) inside of you but recommends to find a balance between the 3 different aspects of entrepreneurship. The 3 aspect being...</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>The Entrepreneur's Role</li>
  <li>The Manager's Role</li>
  <li>The Technician's Role</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>In the book, he asserts that most entrepreneurs are 70% technician, 20% manager and 10% entrepreneur. He then shows how this can be very detrimental, and then shows that it would be best to find a split of 33% technician, 33% manager and 33% entrepreneur. Instead of killing the technician (engineer) inside yourself he details ways to find a balance between the 3 roles. Obviously, there is too much information in that book to detail in this post.</p>

<p>As with anything in life, entrepreneurship tends to be about balance. There is no need to kill the engineer inside you, just make sure that the engineer does not overshadow the entrepreneur and manager inside you.</p>
