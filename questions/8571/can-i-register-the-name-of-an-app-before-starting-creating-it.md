Since I want to create a brand for selling my self-designed items, I'm planning to create a blog and an **app with the same name** to promote them.

The app will run on Android, Windows Phone and iOS.
I already chose its name (let's call it "myname") but I haven't created it yet, and I want to lock the name "myname" to avoid running the risk that other people will use it for their own project.

Can I register (or lock someway) a name of an app even before having created it?

Create a simple Hello World app. Hide app launch behind a password. Launch it into a store under your brand name and a description that saysclearly the app is for customers/clients of your company and viola. 

If you feeling rich, trademark the name. Just because you bought myname.com does not prevent someone from buying myname.co.uk or .net or .info or any other variation. You could later argue it out in court and you might win and you might not.

Nothing is going to be 100% fool proof for you. Each country have their own methods (and costs) for trademarking. In addition, someone could later challenge your claim to the name and a court would decide if they are right or not.

I suggest you just concentrate on your magical app. If its any good, it will win an audience. Spending too much time and money on the packaging will not improve your chances of success more so than concentrating on a quality, working sought after product.
