<p>Sorry if this is not the place to ask this but it's the best I could find.</p>

<p>Thinking of a brand name is so hard to do! I don't want to use my actual name, I want something that reflects my service.</p>

<p>I'm looking at setting up a small shop on Etsy selling reused animal skulls that I have painted or decorated in someway.</p>

<p>The skulls are remade up mainly with black paint and gold features so it's got a dark neo Victorianesque style and would like the name to fit the style.</p>

<p>So far i've came up with things like "Sticks &amp; Stones" and "Immortalise" but I don't feel good about any so far.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any ideas for names?</p>

<p>Kranion. From Greek κρανίον (latin cranium). Brand should be simple; forget "neo Victorianesque" in the name itself, too busy.  Instead, keep the name simple and have the logotype, mark, and design reflect the mood your audience would respond well to.  Just my two cents.</p>

<p>When I'm coming up with brand or product names, I write out every word I can think of that's related to the product or the feel of the product. You might come up with a list like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>bones, skeleton, skull, roadkill, animal, Victorian, elegant, paint, decoration,
  art, artistic, artistry, pirate flag, skull and cross bones, 
  noggin, head, afterlife, immortal, immortalize, eternal, taxidermy ....</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can even put each of these words onto a different piece of paper, or cut the paper list you wrote / printed into separate words and phrases.  Then start combining the words. For example you might put together "artistic bones" or "immortal elegance". Those names sound pretty good to me, but I'm sure you can come up with more!</p>

<p>You can also merge words from your list.  For example, "Skeledecor". (Not so good.)</p>

<p>And you can modify individual words, like "Im/mortal". That one's kind of cool because it includes "immortal", "mortal", and "I'm mortal". However, I might have seen it before; I'm not sure.</p>
