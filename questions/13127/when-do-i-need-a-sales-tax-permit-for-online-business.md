<h1>My Predicament</h1>

<p>Basically, I was going to make my business official, and start selling t-shirts online. I understand sales tax well enough, but I was wondering about <em>sales tax permits</em>. I understand that they are needed to collect sales tax. But can I still legally sell my product without this license, and just not charge the customer sales tax, and absorb the cost myself? Especially since I have strong reasons to believe I may make a few out of state sales. </p>

<p>So far, it seems more feasible to carefully track sales, and absorb the sales tax myself in the short term, as I get a feel for my market. Then as I get a more solid grounding, get the sales tax licenses as needed. But can I do that (well, legally)?</p>

<p>I think it is also worth mentioning two things:  </p>

<ul>
<li>I will not have a physical out of state presence</li>
<li>I will be using an out of state print-to-order service, most
likely Print Aura</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, being new to this, I might be missing the mark completely. Basically, I am confused.</p>
