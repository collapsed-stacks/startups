<p>I own XXX LLC. I have a product called ZZZ. I am going to buy XXX.com, ZZZ.com, and some other variations of the names. So far I feel that XXX.com should stay focused on the business and I would like to ZZZ.com for more information about the product.</p>

<p>Does this seem too confusing for the customer?
Should the purchase page be on ZZZ.com (the product website)?</p>

<p><em>"xxx.com"</em>, oh that site. :) </p>

<p>Okay back to main focus, yes use xxx.com for your business information and use zzz.com for landing page. </p>

<p>From a marketing standpoint, that's a great strategy cause you can control it for a landing page and SEO purposes.</p>

<p>Make sure there is a cross reference link back to each other if they're relevant. </p>
