I own XXX LLC. I have a product called ZZZ. I am going to buy XXX.com, ZZZ.com, and some other variations of the names. So far I feel that XXX.com should stay focused on the business and I would like to ZZZ.com for more information about the product.

Does this seem too confusing for the customer?
Should the purchase page be on ZZZ.com (the product website)?

*"xxx.com"*, oh that site. :) 

Okay back to main focus, yes use xxx.com for your business information and use zzz.com for landing page. 

From a marketing standpoint, that's a great strategy cause you can control it for a landing page and SEO purposes.

Make sure there is a cross reference link back to each other if they're relevant.
