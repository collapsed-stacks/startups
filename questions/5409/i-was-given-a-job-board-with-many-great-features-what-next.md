<p>It's chicken and egg problem: you need viewers before companies post job offers, and job offers before viewers come. To solve it you need to deliver something to either or both parties that makes the website useful even without the job postings.</p>

<p>If you focus on the employee side of the equation, you could do things like CV writing tips (or services, for that matter), job hunt tips and tools, etc. Money allowing, you could also aggregate job offers from third party services using APIs and serve them with a better UI.</p>

<p>If you focus on the employer side of the equation, the most obvious candidate is value-added services on top of the actual job offer. Namely, by semi-automating the recruitment flow, or by making it easier for head hunters to locate the type of candidate they're after and staying in touch with them.</p>

<p>Industry news works pretty well for both sides of the equation if you're targeting a niche.</p>
