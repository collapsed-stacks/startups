I am launching a web agency company, and hiring a Marketing staffer. We may have monthly minimum income targets. The marketer must find enough web projects, and if he meets minimum incomes, he will get percentages and a bonus.

In some months, he may fail to meet the minimum target. In this case, what should I do? Should I warn him, or is there a better way for both the company and him?

What is the standard practice where you are for incentivising sales people? and is the incentive "you have a job?" 

In London, I'm aware that the pay for those types of sales roles is very low, contrasted  with the bonuses, which are high. The pay is typically so low that the bonus is of itself an incentive, and the cost of keeping the "marketer" on is trivial. 

Constant training - regardless of the quality of the sales staff is a good idea. Group training boosts team spirit, and increases skills, and also increases the attractiveness of working at the company. 

I don't know about warning someone who doesn't make quota for any given month, but a warning after 2 or 3 consecutive months (with the warning being "or you're out") is probably par for the course. 

If a "marketer" isn't improving though, as a thought, you might have some other positions in the company that s/he would be qualified for (instead of just booting the poor sod onto the street). Account management springs to mind. 

Finally, I don't know if "marketer" is the right term you're using, and you might waste time screening candidates who *actually* want to market something. "Sales" is probably the term you want, but that depends on where you are.
