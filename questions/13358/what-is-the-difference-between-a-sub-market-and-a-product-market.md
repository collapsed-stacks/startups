I am working on a venture, where the chosen Market is 'Home'.  Within this Market, there are several Sub Markets.  For the purpose of this question, lets single out the 'Art & Wall Decor' Sub Market.

The Sub Market of 'Art & Wall Decor', is made up of the following:

- Canvas Prints
- Wall Decal
- Clocks

Would these 3 points then be considered as the 'Product Markets' within 'Art & Wall Decor', where I would then break up these Product Markets into their own Product Sub Markets 

or 


would the above bullet points simply be another series of Sub Markets within the larger Sub Market of 'Art & Wall Decor' where styles such as 'Floral' and 'Seascapes' etc would then be the Product Markets?
