<p>I am working on a venture, where the chosen Market is 'Home'.  Within this Market, there are several Sub Markets.  For the purpose of this question, lets single out the 'Art &amp; Wall Decor' Sub Market.</p>

<p>The Sub Market of 'Art &amp; Wall Decor', is made up of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Canvas Prints</li>
<li>Wall Decal</li>
<li>Clocks</li>
</ul>

<p>Would these 3 points then be considered as the 'Product Markets' within 'Art &amp; Wall Decor', where I would then break up these Product Markets into their own Product Sub Markets </p>

<p>or </p>

<p>would the above bullet points simply be another series of Sub Markets within the larger Sub Market of 'Art &amp; Wall Decor' where styles such as 'Floral' and 'Seascapes' etc would then be the Product Markets?</p>
