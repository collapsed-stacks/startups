<p>Are there any hardware manufacturers or retailers with discounts specifically for hardware startups (most specifically: routers, hard drives, graphic/sound cards etc.). </p>

<p>Interested in sources that will ship to Canada or are physically located in Canada or North Western United States (Washington/Oregon really). </p>

<p>If you are willing to buy in quantity, many businesses offer discounts for B2B transactions.</p>

<p>For computing equipment, <a href="http://www.newegg.com/" rel="nofollow">Newegg</a> has generally been my go to (personal life). However, they do indeed have a business division, <a href="http://www.neweggbusiness.com/" rel="nofollow">NeweggBusiness</a>. They appear to be offering quantity discounts over at <a href="http://www.neweggbusiness.com/quantity-discounts" rel="nofollow">http://www.neweggbusiness.com/quantity-discounts</a>.</p>

<p>Another company I use often personally is <a href="http://www.frys.com/" rel="nofollow">Fry's</a>. While they don't appear to have a business division online, a few months ago, when I was in store, while discussing large volume buys with a staff member, he informed me that they can setup special discounts, deals, and quotes for business customers who are willing to purchase in volume, although he wouldn't give me a minimum number of pieces.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="http://community.spiceworks.com/topic/148777-the-benefits-of-having-a-business-account-with-tigerdirect" rel="nofollow">TigerDirect posting on Spiceworks</a>, they offer lower pricing for businesses who sign up for a business account with them.</p>

<p>In general, businesses don't seem to care about whether you are a startup or an enterprise. They only care about <strong><em>volume</em></strong>, <strong><em>sales</em></strong>, and <strong><em>revenue</em></strong>. So if you can satisfy one or more of those three options (many products, expensive products, or additional services, respectively), many businesses and possibly even manufacturers may often be willing to work with you and give you discounts.</p>
