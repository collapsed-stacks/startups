I want to apply to [BizSpark][1] to get free Azure for 3 years. 

Do I need to register a company or can I apply as self-employed? In Canada I can work as self-employed without registration, but on the BizSpark page you should enter company name, email and so on:

I have project url, but don't have company name.
