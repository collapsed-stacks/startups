<p>I want to apply to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/bizspark/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">BizSpark</a> to get free Azure for 3 years. </p>

<p>Do I need to register a company or can I apply as self-employed? In Canada I can work as self-employed without registration, but on the BizSpark page you should enter company name, email and so on:</p>

<p>I have project url, but don't have company name.</p>

<p>I contacted Microsoft Evangelist and got the following answer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hi Alex, </p>
  
  <p>You don't have to have a company registered.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They have the following requirements: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>in order to audit the applications, we ask for a corporate email that
  matches your domain name, a valid website and a solid Business
  description.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I applied and was rejected :(.</p>
