<p>If a startup online store company has absolutely no physical location anywhere in the United States I have read that they aren't required to charge sales tax in any place they do not have a physical presence.</p>

<p>My question is, in the past I had another online store and every month we paid taxes in the state of Texas.</p>

<p>If we don't charge taxes and we sell lets suppose 100 dollars worth of merch.</p>

<p>When it comes time to report taxes do I still report that I sold 100 dollars? 
If I do then I have to pay the state.</p>

<p>I'm just confused on how this taxes thing works if I have no physical location anywhere in the United states.</p>

<p>I am in Texas.</p>

<p>In the past I was required to pay monthly and if I didn't pay or was late i was charged 50 dollars as a penalty.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>This is wrong because the premise itself is wrong. There's no such thing as a company without a physical presence anywhere.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Then you must register a company in Texas. It's really as simple as that. Even if you incorporate in another State for whatever reasons (typically wrong ones), you still need to register the business - and declare taxes etc. - locally, in the State you live in.</p>
