<p>I walked away from a business last year. I told my partner that "I quit" and "I am retiring", verbal only, no paper work was filed. The business was structured as a verbal general partnership with one other person (no filings). When I left there was no abnormal debt. Neither did I want anything from the company nor I was asked to pay anything. The company was solvent and making money. Since I left I haven't received or asked for any of the profit.</p>

<p>Now it's a year since I left, and my former partner has incurred debt (warehouse rent) from lack of payment. All this happened after I left. The rental agreement was signed after by my former partner only after I left.</p>

<p>Am I liable for this debt?</p>

<p>Since the business was structured as a verbal general partnership, <strong>you are not liable</strong> for the debt. Moreover, <strong>you have not signed</strong> the rental agreement. This is the strongest argument you can make. But, you must have some sort of proof to support that <strong>you weren't involved</strong> in the business in the past year.</p>
