I walked away from a business last year. I told my partner that "I quit" and "I am retiring", verbal only, no paper work was filed. The business was structured as a verbal general partnership with one other person (no filings). When I left there was no abnormal debt. Neither did I want anything from the company nor I was asked to pay anything. The company was solvent and making money. Since I left I haven't received or asked for any of the profit.

Now it's a year since I left, and my former partner has incurred debt (warehouse rent) from lack of payment. All this happened after I left. The rental agreement was signed after by my former partner only after I left.

Am I liable for this debt?

Since the business was structured as a verbal general partnership, **you are not liable** for the debt. Moreover, **you have not signed** the rental agreement. This is the strongest argument you can make. But, you must have some sort of proof to support that **you weren't involved** in the business in the past year.
