<p>I'm have some software written by freelancers and I need a generic NDA.  I don't have time to learn all the ins and outs, but I need a starting point in the mean time.</p>

<p>There are a plethora of sample / generic NDA's available. Be sure to read them to make sure they are applicable to your situation and edit as necessary. That disclaimer said:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Nolo has a good explanation of the components of an NDA and what you need to consider <a href="http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/nondisclosure-agreements-29630.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>, as well as a sample / template NDA <a href="https://www.nolo.com/products/nondisclosure-confidentiality-agreement-pr111.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Nolo specializes in legal explanations/templates for non-attorneys / DIY / small startups. I think the explanation and NDA is drafted by attorney Richard Sim.</p></li>
<li><p>Gene Quinn is a leading Intellectual Property blogger (and attorney). He has a good article on '<a href="http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2013/11/16/justified-paranoia-confidentiality-before-and-after-patent-filings/id=46374/" rel="nofollow">justified paranoia</a>' (confidentiality specifically related to patents) with links to free sample NDAs <a href="http://www.ipwatchdog.com/tradesecret/sample-confidentiality-agreements/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>

<p>NOTE: I am not an attorney, and this is not legal advice!</p>
