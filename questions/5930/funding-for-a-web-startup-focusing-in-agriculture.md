Context: In some parts of Europe, food baskets bought directly from the farmers and/or cooperatives are gaining momentum. There are several reasons for that, one of which is the belief that this food is healthier and fresher.

I'm starting a web startup that aims at promoting some types of agricultural products. The website we are building is going to give very easy access to the information to the consumers that are looking for food baskets and allow them to choose the right supplier in minutes.(I don't feel very confortable sharing the ways we are going to achieve that publicly). In the beginning we are going to work only with public information and with information provided by the suppliers themselves.

I was wondering if there is funding for that and if there exists specific organizations that fund that type of projects.

Regards,
Samy

<p>If I understand correctly, you are planning a marketplace.</p>

<p>Marketplaces are are good trend, and there is money for them.</p>

<p>But investment comes from different sources for different stages of the business. There is no such thing as investing in an idea in the current stage of startup investing. You need to have a business built to exploit that idea, even if what you have is only the team, but it must be the right team, with the competences and potential to start the business.</p>

<p>For what I understand, you are in the idea phase, what we sometimes call <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideation_%28idea_generation%29" rel="nofollow">ideation</a></strong>. From there, you need to understand what are the competences your founders team need to get this idea and turn it into a business. On a quick and dirty analysis, you will need:</p>

<ol>
<li>someone with technical skills to build (and/or coordinate the building) of your platform;</li>
<li>someone to "sell" your platform to the producers, attract them to you. Note that this is more of a B2B sales person;</li>
<li>someone that is able to attack a consumer market and bring them to your platform, so the producers have who to sell to. This is usually a B2C marketing person, if you are targeting the consumer market. Or a B2B person if you are reaching for restaurants, food services etc.</li>
<li>And, of course, you need someone (usually the CEO) that is able to coordinate the team, attract money (by selling or from investors) and have the vision about the future iterations of the product.</li>
</ol>

<p>Of course it is possible to have one only person handling two different competences, but that might be difficult. What is most likely impossible is for you to try to implement all that competences for yourself. You will need to build a team.</p>

<p>Some investors (accelerators for example) will invest in the team and the idea, with a business being built, before prototypes or Minimum Viable Products. </p>

<p>Once you have a prototype or MVC you might be a target for angel investors, or small seed round VC funds. But you will have to have your technology "proven", that is, that you have the competence to build your vision. If you have revenue and users, even better. There is no argument against traction.</p>

<p>My first advice to you is to build a team, and get out of the building and talk to the producers and see their perception about your vision. No vision endures feedback from clients, so you will have to be open for feedbacks and be ready to pivot when you have reached the limit of your current vision. I advise you to read Erik Ries' <em>Lean Startup</em> on the process, great reference for what you are planning to build.</p>

<p>Then check out accelerators and incubators in your region.</p>

<p>And good luck!</p>
