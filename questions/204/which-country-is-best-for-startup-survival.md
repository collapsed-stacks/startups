<p>I'm thinking of starting a software-based (more specifically, mobile app-based) startup with a small team. We're located in Sri Lanka, but are interested in establishing our startup internationally (another region as well).</p>

<p>I saw in another question here on Startups SE that said that Chile offers the most help to startups and also USA, Argentina, Finland, etc. I would like to know more in detail about the specific help offered by these countries. Such as, are there any grants offered by the government, relocation incentives, privileges, etc.</p>
