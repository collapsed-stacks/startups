I have started marketing through Facebook, Justdial, Sulekha, etc. But I am unable to get a mass public attention for getting students for various courses.

Any great marketing strategy?

How many students do you get?

Total people you market to / people who sign up = **conversion rate**

A standard conversion rate on social media platforms would be something around 1%. So if you're getting more than that than you're doing great.

People are starting to get more and more ad-blind on social media, so you would want to develop marketing strategies on newer platforms, like whatsapp, etc.

Also IT is kind of a niche even if there is so much hype about it. Many people just aren't interested. You need to find those people who do. So I suggest finding out the profile of your ideal customer and targeting your marketing efforts towards them.

I.e. people who want to learn to code they sign up to lists and groups about learning to code (on twitter and fb.). They hang around coding subreddits and forums. So you could start there.
