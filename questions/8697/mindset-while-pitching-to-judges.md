I've signed up to an ideation stage fund. One of the pre-requisite is that you have to pitch for 5 minutes to a panel of 3 person judge.

I have no problem speaking in public. When speaking in public, I tell myself that I'm teaching my audience something new and it helps when some of the audience looks at me or at gives me the occasional nod/smile as feedback.

However, pitching to a 3 person judge is a different beast. All 3 seems to be more interested with their laptop/phones rather than hearing what the pitch is about. No feedback at all. Seems like they've made up their mind the moment I step into the room.

Is this normal scenario? What kind of mindset should I be in when pitching?

It's not very rare that the judges of a startup pitching event appear uninterested. In fact, it is a very common scenario. 

So, these are some ways in which you can attract their attention:

 - Start with a quirky (and/or) an interesting quote/caption, which would get their attention, atleast for a few seconds. (If in doubt, see how the SharkTank contestants start their pitches)
 - Then, you should be able to hold that attention for the next four minutes. Do something really out-of-the-box while demonstrating the product. Always pitch as if the judge would use your product afterwards. (Again, see how the contestants of SharkTank weave up scenarios where they show the judges using their product, and the benefits they get out of it.)
 - If possible(if you have an MVP ready), make the judges try it out. It helps them to both stretch and help you continue to demand their attention.

So, try and try and try to keep the pitch interactive with the judges. Make them answer interesting questions, and show them how the product/idea answers their questions.
