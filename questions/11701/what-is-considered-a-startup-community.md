I was given the task to promote a new start up within the "Startup communities". As  SRDC 2 writes in the comments, I need to promote the start up wherever I can. I was given the term "Startup community" and told to run with the ball. I am trying to identify where I would want to do this. I am aware of Kickstarter. I do not consider it a community. Perhaps I am wrong. Can anyone define what a "Startup community" is and what sites fall under that title?

I hope that this is no longer considered a vague off topic question. It's coming from a newbe who is trying to tread in unfamiliar waters.

Thanks

Well, briefly think about the general concept of community.

What is a community? (Wikipedia)

> Community is commonly considered a social unit that share something in
> common, such as norms, values, identity and place where they are
> located in a certain geographic area, it can be in villages,
> neighborhoods or cities.



Now, just carry the "something in common" for startup deals!

I strongly suggest that you read the book Startup Communities by Brad Feld ... it came out last year and is pretty much the latest definitive work on modern startup communities. And googling will bring up a lot of blogs and websites that summarize the concepts and tell more about the techniques and success stories.
