<p>Are there any other places except freelance sites and LinkedIn to find people with skills/knowledge to hire, partner up, consult with, ask for mentoring, etc.?</p>

<p>it depends on your needs and what type of skills you're looking for.
you'll probably find better talents if you look inside their communities because that's where they're active the most.</p>

<p>for example if you need developers you can have a look at github, stackoverflow or coding challenges websites like hackerrank...</p>

<p>or if you're looking for designers you can search in deviantart..</p>

<p>As @makerGeek suggested, you can find skilled people on the websites they are likely to frequent. One could add Kaggle and Cross-Validated, for data scientists, per example.</p>

<p>Another resource could be <a href="https://www.f6s.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">F6S</a> which is very valuable for startups (loads of resources, the competition they list are a lot of opportunities to meet people related to many businesses...)</p>

<p>If you are looking for partners with partucular skills you can go to <a href="https://www.cofoundme.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.cofoundme.org/</a></p>

<p>If your looking for people to hire there are some good sites as suggested above, it also pays exeptionally to have a good network. There is always a guy who knows a guy. Old professors or supervisors at universities or contacts at a tech company nearby will be very helpful. Sometimes it even pays off to post in a studentforum and offer a bit of money for students with skills. It very much depends on what you are looking for.</p>
