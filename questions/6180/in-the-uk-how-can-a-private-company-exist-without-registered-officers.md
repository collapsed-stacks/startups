<p>A start-up I am interested in following (due to past association with the people involved) has published its First Gazette for Dissolution, which has been suspended.</p>

<p>In the subsequent month since the suspension, each active director has registered their own Termination of Appointment with Companies House, ultimately leaving the company with no active officers, directors or secretaries.</p>

<p>The company has significant debts.</p>

<p>So who is now responsible for the company?  Who is responsible for filing taxes or taking the company through a close down?</p>

<p>By law (Companies Act 2006) you are required to have at least 1 director. </p>

<p>If there is no board which can appoint a director the shareholders may have authority under the companyâ€™s articles to appoint directors. So at this point the shareholders are responsible for appointing a new director ASAP.</p>

<p>If a new director isn't appointed the company will receive a letter from the Companies House with instructions to appoint a new director within a limited time period or face the consequences (e.g. a big fine).</p>

<p>If a director is still not appointed the Companies House will begin the striking off process.</p>
