I have created a niche job board site and there are a couple other sites similar to mine. Since I am just starting is it ok to collect all the job postings from other sites and post it on mine?

Will there be any legal issues?

Given copyright is automatic and you intend to use something owned by someone else, yes, legal issues are possible.


If you need further advice, suggest you retain legal advise from professionals.
