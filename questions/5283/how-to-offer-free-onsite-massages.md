<p>Thinking about free offering onsite massages as a one-time perk, but unable to find any guidance online for doing this as a company. </p>

<p>To offer onsite massages, what decisions do I need to make, what needs to be done, and how will I know if doing offering free onsite massages was worth it?</p>

<p>A massage therapist requires a private room to set up her equipment (a massage bed, massage cream, etc.) and, ideally, a shower for her clients. There are transportable massage beds but you'll be better off with an onsite one.</p>

<p>Note that certifications exist. There's more to massaging than randomly rubbing hands on a body. You can actually harm e.g. the spine by massaging it wrong way, so consider making sure that the therapist has some kind of insurance -- or get one yourself if you recruit her.</p>

<p>As to whether it's worth it, keep an eye on employee churn, morale, and productivity. Or for that matter, usage.</p>

<p>And I agree with Brad's comment: better a Friday afternoon off.</p>
