When I observe the webdesign market in general, the current promotional techniques used by companies is: giving discount, needs analysis, offering free trial and/or providing free support for X months after all. While there's nothing wrong with these techniques, however, non of them can really differentiate a new company. 

What are some new, creative ways to promote a website and be different?
