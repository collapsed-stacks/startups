<p>We are working on a very cool visual, In-Browser HTML/CSS editor. It should eventually shorten and make the way people are working on their sites much more organized and effective.</p>

<p>We would like to find programmers communities to show them  our intro video and get their opinion, can you recommend on forums, groups, chats etc.
Is there a community at SO that i can ask? </p>

<p>Would really appreciate your help!</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Ram</p>

<p>Try three venues:</p>

<ul>
<li>Offline meeting-related venues like meetup.com, to meet with groups of end users offline.</li>
<li>Online interest group-related venus like Facebook groups, to do the same online - and possibly offline as well.</li>
<li>Online beta testing-related venues like erlibird.com, to do online-based feedback gathering and/or user experience tests.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can try finding a group from <a href="https://www.meetup.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Meetup.com</a>. Then, get in touch with one of their members so you can coordinate organizing a meetup. I'm a member of a couple of groups there. And people really do attend the meetups.</p>

<p>Also, you can organize an event in <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">EventBrite.com</a>. The event can be small. All you really need is a venue. I also regularly browse available events in my area on Eventbrite.</p>

<p>Finally, you can organize a hackathon / coding competition where it's a criteria to use your product. You can organize it from <a href="http://www.hackathon.io/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Hackathon.io</a></p>
