I recently had an idea for a company / service that has all of the advantages of Uber and Lyft:

- needed service
- would create a vibrant community of users and providers
- revenue from paying users via cost sharing / fees
- revenue from free users through advertising
- accessible via website or mobile app

Without any of the disadvantages:

- being banned / regulated in some jurisdictions
- only rolled out in limited markets

There currently isn't anything like it, and there is a real need for it (I thought of it because I wish it existed so I could use it).

I've been a software developer for 15 years and the technology and server infrastructure for this are very doable. I presented it to my mastermind group and they said it's the best idea I've had and very viable, and gave some great ideas for implementing and expanding it.

The traditional route is to put on the Jobs / Zuckerberg hat and bootstrap the business until it's operational and growing, then get seed capital to grow more, then go public, etc. However, due to circumstances in life I'm not able to pursue it right now.

Is it realistic to sell the idea while it's still in the concept stage?
If so, what are the steps?  What resources are available?
If not, what other options are there?

> Is it realistic to sell the idea while it's still in the concept stage?

TL;DR: No

Ideas, even good ideas, don't have any value by themselves. Google wasn't the first search engine. eBay wasn't the first online auction house. Amazon wasn't the first online book store. Facebook wasn't the first social network. And so on.

The idea — plus execution — is what makes a company valuable. 

> If not, what other options are there?

Really what you wrote in your question. Look to validate the problem/solution & product/market fit in some way. Look to options to bootstrap cheaply. Look for friends & family / angel / bootstrap funding if necessary.

All of these will involve long term commitments — which doesn't sound like what you're looking for.

An idea is not commodity you can readily buy and sell.  

Is it unique and protect-able?

Is this something you could get a patent on?    
A patent is not cheap but it is something you can sell.   

Let's say you pitch your idea and they say no and then 1 year later they release a very similar service.  How can you prove they stole your idea?  What is the penalty for stealing an idea?  At a minimum you would need to protect yourself with some type of agreement prior to pitching the idea.  For that consult a lawyer.

You are a developer. If you could develop a proof of concept it would be an easier pitch but buyers are going go look for income even if the company is running at a loss. Subscribers with no income can be a sell if there is a clear path on how to turn a free subscriber into income. Even an angel does not buy an idea. They invest early in an idea with a business plan and they expect you to execute the business plan.

Do you have a friend with the time and energy that you could trust with taking the idea forward?  Be active in the company even if it is just a few minutes to a few hours a week.  Get an agreement that you get X% of the company or revenue.  Be aware an agreement can go both ways - if you own 5% of the company then do you also own 5% of the debt - again consult a lawyer.

Is there a company out there today with the proper infrastructure (both for delivery and sale/marketing)?  Maybe a simple agreement and pitch it to them.  Still a long shot you even get a meeting with a big player.  

This may be a case in which you build a proof of concept and take it to angel or VC that has the clout to get a meeting with a player.  But they are going to want a good share (like half) of the company/idea just to make the pitch.  If the idea is not unique, protect-able, and demonstrable a VC is not going to touch it.

Well, In my opinion , An idea have zero value in market. thousands of idea created and failed in a matter of second . even you also can try this at your own.Establishment of that idea have value. What you think? There is not any single messenger in the world before whats app?? Think about it!
 idea are so often to come, full feelings that ideas require expertise.

**so try to bring that idea in real life, it will give you more**
