Let's say that we have an app in Google Store, Apple Store and a website offering the same service. If user buys a subscription per month, he should have access from the 3 devices in his account. In that case who's taking the 30% of each app store ? Is there any term violating, if the user buys on the site the subscription, and then is using the premium feature on an iphone or an android ?

It seems as though the apps should be free, but they won't do anything useful without a subscription.  The user could then buy the subscription from:

 - within the iPhone app, which means you'd lose 30% to Apple, or
 - within the Android app, which means you'd lose 30% to Google, or
 - your website, which means you'd only lose the fee that your payment processor charges.

In the case of payment through the website, your question about "who's taking the 30% of each app store" would not apply.

As for violation of terms, I suspect you're talking about the terms associated with the iTunes App Store and Google Play. I can't imagine them having any issue with setting up your business model the way I described! They wouldn't get their 30% of the in-app purchase if the user purchases through your website (or the other operating system's app), but that's not a violation of their terms.

I picture that when the user pays, on either the Apple device, the Android device, or your website, that you permit one month of app usage to the user's account, no matter where he/she has signed in.

I believe @BrettFromLA is correct. Let me add a few points:

 - You're not allowed to encourage your iOS or Android users to come to your website for payment. In other words, you can't add a button that says "Pay online on our website".
 - You can only ask your iOS or Android users to make a purchase in-app. You'll lost 30% to Apple and Google in this case.
 - Of course you can still link your website in your app

What does that mean? You can setup your payment service on your website, that's not what Apple and Google can stop you. But you can't ask your mobile users to come to your website for payment. If your users know it's possible to pay on your website, and they're happy to do it (without being told within the app), it's ok but you can't force them.

Personally, I'd pay directly because services like Spotify charge extra 30% if I do it in-app. Nobody asked me to do it directly, but I know I can do it.
