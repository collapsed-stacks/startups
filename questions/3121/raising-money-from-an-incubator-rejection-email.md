<p>Theoretically, if a rejection letter was complimentary enough concerning the potential of the proposed idea, stating that the rejection was based on factors outside of what was otherwise an investment worthy prospective, that letter could be used in subsequent funding attempts...</p>

<p>"As you can see, Paul Buchheit seriously considered investing in our company,..."</p>

<p>Which company is anyone's guess.</p>

<p>Based on the context in the video, raising money off of their rejection seems to mean either of:</p>

<ol>
<li>They learned from the feedback and went on to raise money elsewhere; or</li>
<li>They learned from the feedback and re-applied successfully later on.</li>
</ol>
