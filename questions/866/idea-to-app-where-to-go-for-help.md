I have an idea for a website app that wouldn't necessarily make money but might make waves. How can I find developers and analysts interested in creating cool things so I can pitch my idea to them and find some partners? I only have enough skills to make a basic version and not the nice looking, fully functioning thing we'd want.

<p>Appears that you're in the "Washington D.C. Metro Area" according to LinkedIn, so I would suggest searching for <a href="http://www.meetup.com/find/?allMeetups=false&amp;keywords=mobile&amp;radius=10&amp;userFreeform=Washington%2C%20DC" rel="nofollow">free mobile related events on Meetup.com for DC</a> to attend. Before doing that, I'd suggest creating some paper or digital <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/paperprototyping" rel="nofollow">mobile apps prototypes</a> and doing some <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=customer%20development" rel="nofollow">customer development</a> work too.</p>

You could create it yourself? The internet is one heck of a place to learn skills now and there are plenty of sites that will teach you code and what you need to know!

If it's a website based app, an app that's basically just a website, you can use wordpress and one of the many converters now offered to create phone apps out of wordpress sites.

It may take you an hour a night for 6 months to get the knowledge to be able to develop this app yourself!

If this seems like a reasonable idea here are some resources for you:

**Code**
codecademy.com

**Wordpress**
lynda.com
teamtreehouse.com
udemy.com

Hope this helps!

<p>You may ask for money through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdfunding" rel="nofollow">crowdfunding</a> or you may finance your idea by yourself and pay a developer to do it through outsourcing with <a href="http://www.getacoder.com/" rel="nofollow">GetACoder</a> for example. </p>

<p>The problem is that I've got really disappointed by that website and I would also be interested in finding one more strict with the freelancer evaluation.</p>

<p>Lots of people have an idea they're convinced will make, and is worth, bucketfuls of cash, and get frustrated when they can't find anyone to make it happen for them.</p>

<p>So you're in a better starting place. You're looking for glory, not gold. So that's your pitch: the question is where to make it.</p>

<p>I'd suggest signing up for a <a href="http://startupweekend.org/" rel="nofollow">Startup Weekend</a> or similar event. What you really want is a team you enjoy working with, and that kind of event is just the way to find just that. If your pitch goes down well, and if your team has fun and makes progress, you're off and running. If not, you've invested a few hours and a few dollars and learned something useful.</p>

Shipping good software takes someone who knows what they are doing. Everything from Spec writing, use cases, architecture, design, art work, coding, testing, documentation...all of it.  

I recommend that you find someone **who's shipped software before** to build it for you.

To get this person, you'll need money or be lucky enough to have a friend that can help.
