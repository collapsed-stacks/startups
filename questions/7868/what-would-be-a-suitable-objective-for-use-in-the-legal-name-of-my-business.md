<p>I want to register a company name in India. They require that I specify objective/activity of the company as part of the name like <code>"&lt;CompanyName&gt; &lt;ActivityType&gt; Pvt Ltd"</code>. e.g. <code>"&lt;name&gt; Technologies Pvt Ltd"</code></p>

<p>I want to know what is the suitable activity type for my business. Here are the activities we're going to do:-</p>

<ol>
<li>Create web and mobile applications (Paid/free with in app
purchases), mostly advert revenue.</li>
<li>Create websites and earn revenue through subscriptions or advertising.</li>
</ol>

<p>In future we may even provide hosting and other services and create apps and websites for clients, but we currently don't do it.
So what is suitable activity name for my business. Should I choose "Media", "Webs", "Tech", "Info", "Technologies", or any other name which may describe what we do.</p>

<p>Your suggestions are welcome.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Technologies has the advantage of being generic enough that it is likely to cover everything you might ever do. I wouldn't worry too much about it, though. Changing names later is easy. You have a lot more important things to do today.</p>

<p>Your domain name might be a little more important, but you can always pick a better one later, and your business name doesn't have to be the name you actually trade under. You can have multiple brands.</p>

<p>You can list all of your Apps as being written by StarWars Development and your websites can be by StarWars Media. Both would be brands of StarWars Technologies Pvt. Ltd.</p>

<p>The only time you have to use the legal name is in legal documents like bank applications, contracts, etc. Your average customer may never see your legal name unless you want them to.</p>
