<p>I have googled this question and couldn't get a real answer. I am stuck on a good time frame of when a business should began promoting their services. I have started with all the legal requirements for licensing and permits but, because I am dealing with 4 states this will take a few months. Some of my certifications won't be finished till mid August either. I was toying with the idea of building client relations before my official opening day, not sure if this would be wise. </p>

<p>If I wait till August or September to start marketing my services I feel like time has been wasted by waiting till then. I also don't want to start too early and find myself at a disadvantage. Any advice or suggestions would be appreciated. </p>

<p>Back-time your outreach approximately 60 days from when you are looking to start offering your products or services to customers or raising funds from VC firms or other investors. That's when to start building your strategic messaging and putting together a PR plan.</p>
