<p>I'm cofounding on a videogame startup. We finished the organizational chart for our scale, and thought it would be nice to show employees candidates where they will fit if they are hired.</p>

<p>I was also thinking about displaying it in the <code>careers</code> section of our website.</p>

<p>Is there a problem with displaying my organizational chart publicly?</p>

<p>20 years ago the answer would have been yes, definitely, except for the C-level suit.</p>

<p>For a small business nowadays, there's little point in hiding in the age of LinkedIn, AngelList, CrunchBase, etc. and of course Google. If someone really <em>wants</em> to locate key employees they <em>will</em> locate them in a matter of hours - if not minutes.</p>

<p>Past a certain size, you'll likely want to keep it partial at most. As a founder, the last thing you want by then is to have head hunters or your competitors going through your org chat and sending offers to your best employees.</p>

<p>In the startup world Transparency is a virtue. This will attract A players to your team and talent is vital for your success.</p>

<p>Another angle to consider is maintenance of the organisation chart. You want to be transparent - that is a great idea. If you are looking at hiring people then your organisation chart will be out-of-date straight away. Then potential new hires will be seeing something old and that may tarnish the reputation. </p>

<p>I would agree with Denis de Bernardy on the head hunting though. There is an employee for a competitor that I will target to bring in because I have seen her experience/ skills. I would not have seen her details without them being on the company website...</p>
