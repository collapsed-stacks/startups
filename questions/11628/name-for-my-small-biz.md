I run a small boutique from my home and donate a portion of my proceeds to non-profits every month.  My current business name is Be The Good 2 (because Be the Good was taken).  I never thought to do a trademark search and just discovered that Be the Good is trademarked, so I'd like to change my name again.  Not that I want to, but feel the need before I grow.
What do you think of "Michestra"?  Its a mix of both my first and last name.  Thanks in advance for feedback!

I used to be in the same situation as you. Here are two things I did that helped me detemine my business name:

 1. [Fiverr](http://fiverr.com) - There are loads of creative people on there that would love to help you out.
 2. [Shopify's Name Generator](https://www.shopify.com/tools/business-name-generator) - awesome name generator that produces modern results.

I hope this helps.
