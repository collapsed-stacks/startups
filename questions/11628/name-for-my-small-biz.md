<p>I run a small boutique from my home and donate a portion of my proceeds to non-profits every month.  My current business name is Be The Good 2 (because Be the Good was taken).  I never thought to do a trademark search and just discovered that Be the Good is trademarked, so I'd like to change my name again.  Not that I want to, but feel the need before I grow.
What do you think of "Michestra"?  Its a mix of both my first and last name.  Thanks in advance for feedback!</p>

<p>I used to be in the same situation as you. Here are two things I did that helped me detemine my business name:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://fiverr.com" rel="nofollow">Fiverr</a> - There are loads of creative people on there that would love to help you out.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.shopify.com/tools/business-name-generator" rel="nofollow">Shopify's Name Generator</a> - awesome name generator that produces modern results.</li>
</ol>

<p>I hope this helps.</p>
