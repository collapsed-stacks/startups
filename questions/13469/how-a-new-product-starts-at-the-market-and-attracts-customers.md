Let's consider this site as an example? When Stackexchange created how does it attracted customers? What about facbook? Whatapp,Instagram, etc!
Do these community like sites and applications, make fake users at first? Or they buy some customers?(hire many people to join to site/app and write comments).

If someone has a new idea in this field, and made a product, how should he start marketing? how can he estimate the costs? How should he find a marketing strategy? Advertising strategy, and finding investors and how to work with them? ... And consider our case study is a graduated engineer who is just finished his study and built his site/app through his study at the university and has no money!

I know I asked a lot of question but I think they are like a chain that are the steps of starting process. and I will be happy if you answer how many of them you like!

Thank you in advanced!

If you meant this very site, keep in mind that [its earlier version was actually killed](http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/6243/startup-business) a few years back, and it's [not currently going that well](http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/62811/startups) in the sense that it has far too few questions. On the plus side, there are a few SE fanatics who keep the site alive, and an occasional post makes it into the Hot Network Questions, which is one of - if not the main - way the Stack Exchange (SE) network has to promote its communities internally. Plus the very high SEO value of having a very authoritative website on just about any type of topic. My point here is: not reproducible because they had a list.

The SE network itself wasn't magically launched somehow either. It launched as StackOverflow initially. That site was founded by two very famous bloggers in their time: Joel Spolsky of [Joel on Software](https://www.joelonsoftware.com) fame, and Jeff Atwood of [Coding Horror](https://blog.codinghorror.com) fame. Don't underestimate the Power of the List - it can mean everything when you're starting a business. There were thousands upon thousands of receptive programmers who were eager to hear about what Joel and Jeff had to offer when they launched. And once they did it was, of course, an instance success: it helped solve an actual problem (some programmers needed help, others wanted to share their knowhow) that they were very familiar with, and the main competition at the time was the spammy expertsexchange.com (ExpertsExchange or ExpertSexChange depending on how you want to read it) that was all over Google and offering ludicrously bad user experience. The point though is the same as for this site: this is not reproducible either, unless you have a list.

Now, your typical business doesn't start out with thousands and thousands of receptive would-be buyers. What you end up needing to do in most cases is talk to would-be clients. Prefer live 1:1 interactions to get the raw signal. Key things to get a feel of include:

- Whether they're even aware they have the problem you're purporting to solve.
- Whether they care about this problem.
- Whether they'd pay to solve it to begin with - and how much.
- How they'd go about to find a solution - e.g. what keywords they'd use.
- What their decision process would look like - stakeholders, potential pushback among them, who makes the call, etc.
- Whether they'd promote your solution in a way or another if they were clients.
- Where you could go guest blogging or advertise to reach out to similar people.

Meeting as little as a dozen or so will give you tremendous insights into the market you're after.
