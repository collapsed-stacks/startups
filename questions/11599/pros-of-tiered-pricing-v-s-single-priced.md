<p>I have created a list of the pros to Tiered Pricing v.s. Single Pricing for monetizing an SaaS to determine which method seems best. It seems like a majority of companies I have dealt with go with a Tiered Pricing approach. Sometimes the single priced plan seems like it would make things simpler. I am wondering if their is a science behind it? </p>

<p><strong>pros of a tiered pricing plan</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>cast a larger net to the amount people are willing to pay</li>
<li>creates the opportunity to get more per customer</li>
<li>allows people to take a lower risk with cheaper plan</li>
<li>allows a company to expand services and create more plans</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>pros of a single priced plan</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>removes an extra decision in the buying process</li>
<li>simpler 

<ul>
<li>marketing</li>
<li>development</li>
<li>pricing strategy</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Any thoughts would be cool!</p>

<p>With a tier pricing model you essentially segmenting your market based of features, needs, etc. Many SaaS companies use tier because they know that many parts of their market need different solutions. A great example is a web hosting company. Many just need simple hosting for one site. others need a more enterprise solutions. If you offer one simple price you leave half of your potential market looking for another solution.</p>

<p>If you are looking to start a company and you want to explore which model works for you, then go do customer discovery. You may find that your market is more segmented than you think and that a tier pricing may capture more of said market.</p>

<p>If you think about this as a classical pricing exercise, tiered pricing is a strategy to harvest value for different customer groups characterised by usage profiles.</p>

<p>Simplifying and exaggerating to make the point, suppose pricing of $1 per occasion of use was a good value trade for moderate users. But it's not a good representation of value generated for the customer group you want to serve who will be making hundreds of uses each month. So you decide to offer the option of $50 per month, with 100 uses included, any more charged at 40Â¢.</p>

<p>There's more to classical pricing than that, but in the startup case, it's pretty rare that what you're concerned about is price as a source of competitive advantage through effective value harvesting. Far more often, the question is, how do I present pricing (if at all) in a way that will maximise customer acquisition?</p>

<p>The great <em>dis</em>advantage of tiered pricing is that it introduces the possibility of the customer making a wrong decision ahead of the purchase decision. This is a factor people seriously underestimate. So in the absence of specifics, I would generally avoid presenting choices like this while you're working on product/market fit. Better to over-deliver on value than delay or miss the sale.</p>
