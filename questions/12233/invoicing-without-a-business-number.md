## Invoicing without a business number?

<p>In Canada, by law, you must provide your business number when giving invoices. If a sole proprietor uses their name for their business name, they are not legally required to register their business (unless they exceed $30k). I do not have a number. Does this mean that I do not need it on my invoices?</p>
