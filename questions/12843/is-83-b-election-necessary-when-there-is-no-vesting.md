<p>I have issued 90% stocks myself without any vesting as I'm a single founder.</p>

<p>I do understand 83(b) election is required when there is vesting and should be filed within 30 days.</p>

<p>My question is that when i raise money in the future, can a investor ask me to adjust my issued stocks to put me on a vesting schedule?</p>

<p>If thats possible, then I have two questions.</p>

<ol>
<li>If I file 83(b) election at that time, is that valid?</li>
<li>Although I don't have any vesting now, can I still file 83(b) election now as a precaution? Is there any drawbacks?</li>
</ol>
