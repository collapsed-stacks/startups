I have issued 90% stocks myself without any vesting as I'm a single founder.

I do understand 83(b) election is required when there is vesting and should be filed within 30 days.

My question is that when i raise money in the future, can a investor ask me to adjust my issued stocks to put me on a vesting schedule?

If thats possible, then I have two questions.

 1. If I file 83(b) election at that time, is that valid?
 2. Although I don't have any vesting now, can I still file 83(b) election now as a precaution? Is there any drawbacks?
