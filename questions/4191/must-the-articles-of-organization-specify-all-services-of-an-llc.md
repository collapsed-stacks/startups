I filled out the Articles of Organization when incorporating and responded to the following question: 

    The professional service limited liability company shall practice the profession(s)


What are the repercussions of having a LLC perform services that are outside the scope of that defined in the Articles of Organization at incororation?  Illegal?  Not protected by LLC? 


I ask because my business may change or provide services that are not specific.

Generally there is no consequence. It is a general description. If there is a major pivot, you can always amend the articles and inform the state, usually there is a small fee. Since the requirements may vary by state, it may be a good idea to inquire.
