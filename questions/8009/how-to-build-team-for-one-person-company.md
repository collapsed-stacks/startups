<p>I have formed a one person company. I don't have money to pay salary and I can't offer equity since I am director of company and I own all shares as its opc. How can I build team? </p>

<p>You cannot hire without paying, of course, but your opc can still work with other businesses. The contract governing your relationship would specify the responsibility of all parties and the distribution of revenue or profits.</p>

<p>If for example, you are the one selling to customers, the contract might specify your commission. If you are doing accounting, it might specify hourly rates. </p>

<p>However the responsibilities are split, the one being paid by the customers, would need to pay those supplying the services that helped him get to that money.</p>

<p>So the other members of your "team" are really part of your supply chain either as your customers or as your suppliers.</p>
