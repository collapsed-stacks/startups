<h3>Answer</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>They want you to enter a mailing address.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h3>Explanation</h3>

<p><em>Process</em> in that paragraph stands for <em>"process service."</em> A "<em>process server</em>" is what they call the person who hand-delivers the law suit papers to you. That's required by law to initiate a law suit. (They might or might not also choose to say something like, "You have been served." But that's not necessarily required. They do it in books and movies for dramatic effect.)</p>

<p>So the paragraph says that if somebody wants to sue your company, they can do so by serving papers to the Secretary of State of New York.</p>

<p>Then, in the blank that follows where you cut off your question, you are supposed to enter the address where the Secretary of State can mail you a copy of the law suit papers.</p>

<p>This is necessary so that people will have a way to sue your company even if you move out of state or become difficult to otherwise locate.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Be careful</h3>

<p>The address you enter could be your home, or your attorney or CPA or anywhere you feel comfortable receiving law suit papers.</p>

<p>You will usually have a short period of time to respond to a law suit. Less than 3 weeks is common. (Otherwise, you might forfeit your case!) So you want to choose the address carefully knowing that the mail will be opened in a timely fashion and won't go unopened.</p>

<hr>
