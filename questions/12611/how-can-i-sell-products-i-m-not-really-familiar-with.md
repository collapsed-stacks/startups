I've read a lot about Korean cosmetics and why a lot of people are getting interested into, but I always doubted of selling them due to my little knowledge. Would you buy from a guy who doesn't know much about cosmetics? Is this decisive for you before buying a known/unknown product?

It doesn't matter if you know nothing about cosmetics. One of the biggest tech startups, AirBnB, which is now worth over 20Billion, was started by 3 art school graduates. They knew nothing about travel nor tech and they still managed to do it.

If you're still not convinced I suggest that you just start doing it. If you're really serious about it, by the time you get to your first sale you'll be a cosmetic expert.

So just do it.
