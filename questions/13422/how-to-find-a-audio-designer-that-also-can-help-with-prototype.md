<p>I am trying to develop a small portable speaker unit with blue tooth capabilities, LED lighting, and ideally an app to manage it.   </p>

<p>How do I find a designer (engineer?) who can:<br>
1) design the electronics,<br>
2) design the case it will be mounted in
3) build a prototype for evaluation</p>

<p>Thank you!
Ken</p>
