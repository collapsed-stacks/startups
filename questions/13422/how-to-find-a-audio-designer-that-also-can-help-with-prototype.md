I am trying to develop a small portable speaker unit with blue tooth capabilities, LED lighting, and ideally an app to manage it.   

How do I find a designer (engineer?) who can:   
1) design the electronics,  
2) design the case it will be mounted in
3) build a prototype for evaluation

Thank you!
Ken
