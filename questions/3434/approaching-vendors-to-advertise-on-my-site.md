I have built a website that will be a directory for a niche of schools. There is a page that will list them by region and each will link to their own website. 
I discovered that there wasn't a list of all these schools and as I was learning to code thought it would be a good challenge. 

What I was wondering is if I am in a position to charge the school a fee to be listed - and if so how much is reasonable. I'm based in the uk . 
The site is yet to be hosted so I obviously have no hits but the niche is large. 

The other thing I was considering is to sell a related ebook on the site.

It is, but not the way you think. Build the site, list the schools for free, send them traffic, and *then* they'll -- *maybe* -- accept to give you money. It's a big maybe, though, unless you're sending paying customers to private schools. Thus, better find other ways to monetize your site.
