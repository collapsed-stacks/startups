I have an app with different calculators usable in civil aviation. I thought to try to sell it via subscribtion, I will charge montly / yearly fee for it.

I guess price should be depending on the complexity of the App. Which measurement do you know to evalutate complexity?

Which pricing model do you know to set a regular subscription fee for the usage of the different modul of App?

Customers do not care about the complexity of their app. Its all supply and demand. So instead of trying to evaluate based on the complexity here are 2 other ways I recommend:

1. Talk to customers:
Figure out who your customers are, go talk to them, ask what tools they are using to solve this particular problem and how much would they be willing to pay for your solution.

2. Use analog products:  
This means research, find products that are solving the same problem that you are solving. Get the average of their price and add a percentage based on how easier it is to use your product according to theirs.



Lastly I don't think subscription based mobile apps are a good idea. Unless you are providing them with a backend service that does all the work, you should stick to a 1 time purchase for mobile apps.

You might want to consider in-app purchasing instead of a subscription model.  People are pretty used to their phone apps being free or so near-to-free as to have only trivial cost.  Involuntary ongoing costs (subscriptions) are practically unheard-of.

There is a big difference, from the customer's point of view, between a mandatory subscription and the option to spend a few bucks for a token which grants n uses of an apps advanced features.  

Just make sure that your basic app's functions (the ones that don't consume tokens) are valuable enough to get customers to download it in the first place.

--- Edit ---

As interactive conversations in comments are discouraged, let me clarify what I was saying above in response to the comments below...

The only type of in-app purchasing that I use is consumable, and I often forget that other types are available.  I find that allowing users to purchase uses of my apps' advanced features in small bundles (5, 10, 25 uses) is received with much resentment than when I even mention the subscription word.
