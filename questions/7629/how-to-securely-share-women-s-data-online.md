<p>I am working on <a href="http://www.inspuratesystems.com/tuitionteacher/search.php">a startup in Pakistan</a> that allows you to search for a teacher online. The search results show contact number of the person so they can be contacted for hiring.</p>

<p>One issue that I am facing is if women provide contact numbers in my country, they might be harassed using phone. How can I avoid it? Shall I remove the contact number to be compulsory for women? Thanks.</p>

<p>Why don't you implement a system where the pupil must send a request to the teacher.</p>

<p>The teacher can access to the full profile of the pupil, if he/she accepts the request, then the contact may be etablished, else if, profile's information stays invisible</p>

<p>An other option is to don't specify genre of the teacher. Just describe her as "Math professor at university, speaks english, [blablabla...]"
And show the genre or photo after the request was accepted.</p>

<p>One option is to offer some other, safer form of communication that the teachers can use without giving out their phone number. After the teacher feels safe with a particular person, he/she could give his/her phone number.</p>

<p>Your site could offer that safe communication via instant message, audio chat, or video chat. That could be combined with a rating system; students with low ratings (because they're new) would be limited to the type of communication and the number of different people they could contact each day.</p>

<p>I wasn't a fan of either of the two answers here so I'll submit my two cents.</p>

<p>Let it be known -- In America, basically every teacher in the country has work contact info publicly available (unemployed or employed - some have work phones even when they aren't currently in an administrative position). </p>

<p>When I'm faced with issues like these, I like to think of hacks that mitigate damages and increase the disincentives of any potential threat.</p>

<p>Is there any way you can mix the contact details for male and female teachers? Perhaps this means removing any flags for gender, essentially removing the search capacity to target females.</p>

<p>You don't have to be a genius to know it's easy to aggregate female contact numbers online - it's just your job not to aggregate it for them.</p>

<p>Cultural disclaimer: When I visited India, I was blown away by the sexism in the country, and imagine Pakistan isn't much different (I was lucky enough to visit the Wagah Border!) -- my point is that unless you're making a hiring directory to find female teachers (which is by definition, sexist), you should take into consideration the points I have listed below. Note: this is by and large a cultural problem, not one pertaining to startups, but I'll answer all of the professional concerns I have with actually building the software:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Make it very easy to remove your contact info if you are a teacher</p></li>
<li><p>Make adding a contact phone optional. Email should always suffice for positions like this, and it's far less aggressive / open to spam.</p></li>
<li><p>When you enter a marketing stage, be sure to target specifically towards school districts and places where the teachers know their data is being presented. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Bonus points if you decide to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Require verified authentication to view contact information of a teacher</li>
<li>Allow teachers to maintain their own profile and privacy settings</li>
</ul>
