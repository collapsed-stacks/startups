When launching a tech company, what is the most important thing to create: the final product and then launch it or create some expectations on people and them launch the product?

I would say that this is a question that is completely product dependent.

Some industries are more important that  others, and I think it's fair to say there is currently a strange bias placed towards launching early.

I strongly believe a product must serve *full market purpose* in order to *gain a market share.* If your product isn't solving a problem when you're releasing it, **why are you releasing it?**

From my experience, you are perfectly fine to release a product once it solves the problem. Then you can release additional updates to *solve it better.* this way you continue to capture market share while gaining credibility with your clients.


Edit: to more directly answer your question, you need to build customer confidence by meeting deadlines and achieving *progress.* If you're showing you are making that progress, the expectations build into the satisfaction that comes from launching the product.


Therefore the final product is more important than the spoken word, but the customer confidence is often directly proportional to the success built vertically from the company's product.

I once read about a multiplier effect between the value of a good idea versus the value of good execution. They're both important, but the actual execution ( product development, market strategy) are what have the most company value.
