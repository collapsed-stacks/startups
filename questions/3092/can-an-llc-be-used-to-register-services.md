Can an LLC, using an EIN*, be used to register services such as a merchant account, bank account, phone, internet, PO Box, etc. instead of registering the services to you in your name with your SSN?

*NOTE: An LLC doesn't normally come with an EIN, so a request for an EIN would need to be submitted

I know this may vary depending on the service, but when the part-time receptionist named Suzy calls in to order new service for a large company, the service isn't registered to Suzy, is it? Suzy may not work there for forever. Doesn't it get registered to the company?

Yes. That is the entire point, in fact. (Or one of them anyway.)

A registered business is legal entity just like you and me, with the ability to sign contracts, buy things, own things, sell things, hire people, etc.
