I have founded an LLC with a partner and want to bring in two more co-founders for a n% of the company. How would I go about doing this legally, what document would I need to accomplish this?

<p>You are unable to issue legally recognized shares in an LLC structure. I recommend looking into other business structures that permit such issuance.</p>

<p>The document is an operating agreement</p>
