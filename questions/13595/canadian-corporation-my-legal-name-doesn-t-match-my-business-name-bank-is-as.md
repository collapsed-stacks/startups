My full legal name is JOHN DOE TREMBLAY, however i always use only JOHN TREMBLAY. All my bank accounts are under the name of JOHN TREMBLAY, but my ID cards are using my full name JOHN DOE TREMBLAY. So when i incorporated my business, I also used the name JOHN TREMBLAY, which means my business currently has John Tremblay listed as president.

I'm currently trying to remotely open a US bank account with BMO Harriss. The process was almost completed, but i'm stuck in the compliance review because my legal name doesn't match the president's name.

Following is an excerpt from the feedback received:

> “The Articles provided show the name of the director as JOHN
> TREMBLAY.” “The Driver’s License, Social Insurance card that was
> provided has his legal name as JOHN DOE TREMBLAY. “ · “Therefore, the
> Articles of Incorporation provided needs to be “amended” as to how the
> legal name shows on his driver’s license.” o Please provide an
> amendment clarifying your identity with your full legal name.

What exactly is an amendment to the article of incorporation and how do I do this? Can I do it myself or do i have to meet a notary?

Isn't there easier option to solve this problem, without having to pay fees and face government delays? Can't the business produce a resolution allowing JOHN TREMBLAY to act on behalf of the business?

Thanks!
