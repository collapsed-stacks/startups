<p>My full legal name is JOHN DOE TREMBLAY, however i always use only JOHN TREMBLAY. All my bank accounts are under the name of JOHN TREMBLAY, but my ID cards are using my full name JOHN DOE TREMBLAY. So when i incorporated my business, I also used the name JOHN TREMBLAY, which means my business currently has John Tremblay listed as president.</p>

<p>I'm currently trying to remotely open a US bank account with BMO Harriss. The process was almost completed, but i'm stuck in the compliance review because my legal name doesn't match the president's name.</p>

<p>Following is an excerpt from the feedback received:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The Articles provided show the name of the director as JOHN
  TREMBLAY.” “The Driver’s License, Social Insurance card that was
  provided has his legal name as JOHN DOE TREMBLAY. “ · “Therefore, the
  Articles of Incorporation provided needs to be “amended” as to how the
  legal name shows on his driver’s license.” o Please provide an
  amendment clarifying your identity with your full legal name.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What exactly is an amendment to the article of incorporation and how do I do this? Can I do it myself or do i have to meet a notary?</p>

<p>Isn't there easier option to solve this problem, without having to pay fees and face government delays? Can't the business produce a resolution allowing JOHN TREMBLAY to act on behalf of the business?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
