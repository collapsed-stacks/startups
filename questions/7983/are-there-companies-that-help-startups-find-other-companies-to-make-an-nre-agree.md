<p>An NRE (Non-recurring engineering) agreement, in my understanding, is an agreement where one company pays another company to develop a product for them. I want to look for some way to find companies that may be interested in paying us to develop a product similar to what we're currently working on. Is there another term for "NRE Agreements" I can look up? Are there consultancies that help companies find symbiotic matches like this?</p>
