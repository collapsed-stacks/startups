The long and short of it is, you want someone to provide you with a list of companies/people who will buy your products.  That's really *your* job as an entrepreneur, not anybody else's.  Even if such a list were available, I doubt it would be free.  Why?  Well, someone had to do the hard work of putting that list together in the first place, and I doubt they'd do it just to be a nice guy to people they don't know.

What you're asking for is like the guy who decides to go fishing and expects to just show up at the lake to collect up the fish other people already caught for him instead of doing it himself, one fish at a time.  Maybe he'll get a bite and maybe he won't.  That's the risk - and the reward - of fishing.

It's up to you to figure out who your target market is and then find ways to contact them.  There's nothing wrong with doing it one potential customer at a time, if need be.  That's what makes being a business owner so difficult.  But it's also the risk - and reward - of being a business owner.

So many people think it's simple to get a business off the ground -- it isn't.  It takes hard work, dedication, risk-taking, and long hours, all with no guarantee you'll make it.   

Only *you* know what it is you're selling, so only *you* know who would be the most interested in buying it.  So in reality, only *you* can put together the list you're asking everyone else for.

Time to get your hands dirty, my friend.  You have the whole world wide web at your fingertips...
