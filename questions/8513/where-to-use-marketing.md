Im working on a small startup that is based in Croatia, its a restaurant reservation service similar to OpenTable.com 

Now Im wondering where should I addvertise mostly (facebook, Instagram, Google, maybe even make some sort of a short animated video and put it on youtube as an add, or just to pay big newspaper companies to make an article about us). 

If I was to chose just one of these I should put all my marketing money into that one, or should I use all of them and spread the money (equaly) and see which one of them generate the most users/feedback.

 How much do you think I should invest in marketing (monthly) since the audience in croatia is about 2.8 million people according to Google and Facebook.<br /> But then again I will have to addvertise in other EU countries (mostly germany, Italy, Austria, Slovenia, Hungary, Czech etc..) by the beggining of summer (arround end of may generaly speaking). Any advice would be helpful, I like to hear other peoples opinions. (Sorry for any grammar/spelling mistakes, eng is not my native language)

First of all, marketing is a bit more wider and complex than just advertising (the top of the iceberg). So, a **Marketing Plan** is the right tool to start, because it IS what will actually answer your question. I did a research, and didn't perfectly verified it, but looks like this How-To answers how you could do a **Marketing Plan**: http://www.wikihow.com/Create-a-Marketing-Plan

Going deeper in your question's answer, the main things in the marketing plan that will answer your question are:

 1. Your target public: their profile, uses, preferences, and, more specifically:
 a) WHERE THEY USE TO FIND INFO; 
 b) and WHAT MEDIAS THEY ACCESS.
 2. Your goods and services, goals, mission/value statements, etc.
 3. Your brand standards and foundations, that central thing your brand "sells" and communicates (status, quality, price, etc)

Having reflected about this, and knowing the audience and values of each media option, you will naturally answer to your question.
