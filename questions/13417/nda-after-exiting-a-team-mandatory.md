I just left a team because of various reasons. Now they want me to sign an NDA to ensure I won't talk about it. There are no prior contracts or even verbal promises about the kind of participation in the future company. Neither have I ever promised to sign an NDA. 

Do they have a right to enforce me signing an NDA or is that just putting pressure on me when they say that?

I'm talking about German law, again, it's just a loose team until now, no legal basis. Would it change if there was a legal basis for the team?

I know nobody here can give me legal advice, but since the stakes are pretty low or non existent, I'm willing to take the risk. Currently my approach is to just let it sit and not sign anything until they give me a good reason to believe that I have to and I'm not sure I'm on the right track doing so.

They have no right to enforce you to sign such a thing, and cannot force you to sign it.

They're hoping you'll sign, of course. It might be handy for them because they may need to justify down the road that they've been properly protecting their IP. This could occur during due diligence while raising funds, for instance.

Ask them "For what reason should I do sign that?"
Their answer should contain the EUR-sign and a reasonable number in front of that.
