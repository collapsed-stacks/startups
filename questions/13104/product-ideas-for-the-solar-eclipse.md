I happen to be in the region where the solar eclipse would pass in August. About two million people are estimated to come to this area. 

The opens a unique opportunity to do some short lived business. Apart from Air B&B, Lyft and Uber, what products and services can I sell during this high traffic? 

Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.

I suspect this question will be closed because (1) it's asking for a list, and (2) it's asking for other people to come up with ideas for you.

However, I'd recommend selling / renting some essentials:

 - food
 - water
 - parking
 - glasses you can use to look directly at the sun
 - bathroom access
 - your Wi-Fi password (you can change it to something simple for the day, then change it back)

People might also like joke products such as "solar eclipse sunscreen", which would be SPF 1.
