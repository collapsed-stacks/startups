<p>I happen to be in the region where the solar eclipse would pass in August. About two million people are estimated to come to this area. </p>

<p>The opens a unique opportunity to do some short lived business. Apart from Air B&amp;B, Lyft and Uber, what products and services can I sell during this high traffic? </p>

<p>Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>I suspect this question will be closed because (1) it's asking for a list, and (2) it's asking for other people to come up with ideas for you.</p>

<p>However, I'd recommend selling / renting some essentials:</p>

<ul>
<li>food</li>
<li>water</li>
<li>parking</li>
<li>glasses you can use to look directly at the sun</li>
<li>bathroom access</li>
<li>your Wi-Fi password (you can change it to something simple for the day, then change it back)</li>
</ul>

<p>People might also like joke products such as "solar eclipse sunscreen", which would be SPF 1.</p>
