<p>I am a software developer by profession. I am working full time. I recently hired a web designer to work full time on an idea I had (I pay his salary from the money I earn from my day job). While the idea is being developed, I find my self spending my earnings than generating any cash flow. I don't feel this is a good business model. Can anyone suggest me a possible business to get into with the skills of the designer and me to generate cashflow?</p>

<p>Honestly I think you are spending money. I don't know what kind of business you are developing but as Software Developer as well, I can tell you. Don't waste money like that.</p>

<p>I would mind to define 100% what exactly you want to do and if you really need a designer, pay for a specific job as freelancer, not full time. For example, if you need a layout for your website, pay just for it.</p>

<p>Again, think about if you really need this and think about other companies in the world, Google, Facebook, they had terrible designs at the beginning, what matter is if you have a good product to offer, a good experience, not the fancy stuff ;)</p>
