<p>I'm currently working on an iPhone productivity app that will be released soon. I also plan to release the app for iPad and Android. Should I launch the iPad and Android version as soon as possible after the iPhone app or should I establish the iPhone app first?</p>

<p><strong>Launch strategy:</strong> </p>

<p>If you are dedicated that you want multiple versions early on, try to launch iOS first with both iPhone and iPad support. Try to get it featured from Apple Store. The reason is, Apple has a significantly higher chance of featuring an app that is only exclusive in their platform. Its not important when you release the Android app as long as its after you get featured in iOS store. </p>

<p><strong>What I recommend:</strong> </p>

<p>Do not use launch strategies, big launches, PR, social media etc.. Just build something, launch it. Get feedback, iterate and continue on this loop until you have something great. Do this while you are only on one platform, you need to find the right product first before trying to push your product to a lot of people.</p>

<p>Hope I was helpful</p>

<p>Think is goes without saying that you need to launch something as soon as your in the position to do so.  Once you've done that, unless you were using a cross-platform development environment, I would recommend you learn as much as you are able to from the launch before moving onto future releases on new devices, platforms, etc.</p>

<p>I've read, through my own research online, that certain types of apps would do better with a soft launch in a small region. Instead of opening your app to widespread critique all at once it gives you the chance to beta test and improve your app before the rest of the world gets a hold of it.</p>

<p>That's what we plan on doing with our app: releasing to just the Canadian Play Store initially. Then based on the feedback we see we will improve the app and eventually release to the App Store and the rest of the Play Store.</p>
