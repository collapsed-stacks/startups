Well i have this very big problem going around my head all day. I got a project about a social media platform for something really specific. And founded interested investors here on South America, the problem is i tend to see social media platforms as US based in order to be successful; I kind of think that we should convince our investors to move us to the US and look up for other potential investors there (so its very high risk), but one of my partners (co founder) thinks we should launch here (with operations based in our country), so we get into this argument where i think whenever the platform is released, we will be against the clock before some US based copy is launched and we got dumped right away, while he thinks with a good marketing plan we could reach US users without a problem and is not needed for us to risk so much.


So as you can see i am in a dilemma, i also think renting US servers without being able to be physically close to them it's a huge pain in the ass, we expect high traffic and South American servers don't convince me at all... Maybe i am overthinking, but i see the US as the land to be the successful by the reach you can pull in there. But at the same time i am thinking investors could be scared off with such high risk. More than anything its my idea of a US based clone that will take us of the market.


Any constructive opinion or feedback will be much appreciated.
