<p>I heard you need a licensing attorny but in my state " oklahoma" i can't find one near me. Could i just use a patent attorney to help go over contracts, agreements and terms?</p>

<p>Most patent attorneys (those who write patents) do not do licensing.  Attorneys who do patent licensing generally don't write patents.  Those are very different skill sets.</p>

<p>I wouldn't restrict yourself to an attorney in your state.  You don't need to meet in person and can do everything over phone and email.</p>
