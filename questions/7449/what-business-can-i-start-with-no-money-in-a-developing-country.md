<p>I have been working as computer technician, IT consultant and 1st level system administrator for about 6 years. I am also quite good at cooking, and I have 7 years of experience working as waiter and pizza chef helper in many restaurants in the south of Italy and overseas. </p>

<p>Here is the scenario. I am nearly 28 years old, and a year ago I gotten streaked out by a rare illness called pudendal neuralgia, and as result of that I had to give up at my job since this illness no longer allow me seat, pain is something unthinkable and inexplicable at the same time.</p>

<p>It led me to dry out my entire bank account in not even 8 months between medical bills and medicines. </p>

<p>I am Italian and my girlfriend is Mexican living in Mexico. I got sick and tired of being here in Italy living with my family, doing nothing the whole day long and be apart from my girlfriend. </p>

<p>So I decided to relocate to Mexico City for good, but I have little no money and no chances of getting any office jobs (remember I cannot seat), and for the very same reason I have no chances of getting virtually any jobs that involves heavy body work.</p>

<p>I had an idea to build my own website where I offer individuals and small businesses technical support, network and storage services, website building and selling hosting services for whatever company. </p>

<p>My question is, how would I promote this kind of service / website in a city of 26000000 people? </p>

<p>Also, what else can I do that could bring me a little income with little no investment required? When I am saying "little no investment" I am referring to something around $2000 maximum, possibly less.</p>

<p>My girlfriend suggested we should put up our own small laundry business, where I could have a little corner and offer customers computers and smartphones repair, and of course help out with the laundry business.</p>

<p>Please I truly need your help. Any advices or ideas will be more than welcomed. I must to take action right now and regain ownership of my own life.</p>

<p>Regards, </p>

<p>Pietro </p>

<p>For starting a business you need capital, for sales and marketing as well as for hiring technical staff. Since you don't seem to have that, Why don't you model yourself as a consultant(as you said you have 6 years of experience), and offer your services to companies in the city you are living in. Also start a website on what are the services that you are offering, if you can afford a domain, go for it. Otherwise a blogspot would be fine, make sure you have pages on google plus, facebook and about.me as well. create a page in github webpages if you can. Other way is signup in freelancer or odesk to check for similar types of roles you are interested in. cheers :)</p>

<p>I would look up CPA Cost per action, its a very profitable method to make money online, you just buy ad space on instagram accounts on shoutcart.com , and promote links for trials or products or whatever they want you to promote, very little investment and much to gain</p>
