We would like to have a better payment solution and since we are offering services to the globe, is it worthwhile to setup a US company in order to use US based payment solution like Stripe? 

Especially we need to use subscriptions based billing which none of our current local payment providers is doing (or very expensive)

Are there any caveats? e.g. tax

<p>The benefit of online payment gateways like Stripe, Paypal, Braintree, etc. is that you can make and accept payments from anywhere in the world and they'll handle the conversions for you - see <a href="https://stripe.com/blog/new-currencies" rel="nofollow">Stripe's blog on their new currency conversion system</a> if you're keen on using them. Plus, they'll store credit/debit card details which is a massive bonus and one less thing for you to worry about.</p>

<p>However, although Stripe accepts payments from users worldwide, they currently only accepts businesses to open accounts from <a href="https://stripe.com/global" rel="nofollow">18 countries</a> (as of March 2015).</p>

<p>It doesn't make sense to setup a US company just to use Stripe though, you can use them wherever you're based.</p>

<p>With regards to taxes, your company pays the income tax as usual and, as far as I'm aware, there's no benefit or financial gain by setting up your business in America. Just sounds like hassle to me!</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
