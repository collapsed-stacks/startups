I have a set of very basic questions, for which I am struggling to find the right answers.

I am starting an online travel portal, through which a customer would be able to book flights, book hotels, book buses, etc.

1. What is the business model of online travel portal?
2. What is the revenue model of online travel portal?
3. How do these sites make money when customer books from their sites?
4. How they approach any hotel to integrate with them ?
5. What should be things to keep in mind while starting an online travel portal ?


If I could get relevant knowledge about it, it would be very helpful.
Thanks.

Approaching hotels: select travel operator or select the country ->type of hotel -> shortlist by guest feedback.</p>
