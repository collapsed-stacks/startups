I'm doing research on a specific very large, international company based in Asia.  I need to find out as accurately as possible, all of the subsidiaries and wholly owned companies of the parent company.  Additionally I need to find the all the web sites associated with the parent company and subsidiary companies.

 Any suggestions as to a good place to start? Specific resources for this type of research?  Thanks.

I would recommend starting on their corporate website. There are a lot of information you can get out of there. Start looking for pages like *about us*, *history*, or *Investors* on the footer of the website. This is where most business put these links. You will get a lot of information there. 

You can also try googling it, as simple as it sounds. Try these footprints:

* "Company" subsidiares
* "Company" subsidary
* "Company" business acquire
* "Company" buys business

I am confident that you will be able to find what you are looking for. Keep an eye out for press releases and business websites that publish news. Most (if not all) of these websites will point to a source. If you can't find any links within the articles, be sure to check the sources portion.

Google the company name and you will get most of the information. Try Linkedin, here you will find at least one connection working in that company or subsidiary and then try to get as much as information you can get from that connection.
