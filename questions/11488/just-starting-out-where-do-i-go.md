<p>Im a college student who is very skilled in software, electrical, and mechanical engineering. When i finish school i would like to have my own company with some (1-3) employees. I have many product/business ideas that are small problems that have already been solved but have pain points that i can solve. </p>

<p>My question is how do i get started creating demand, and visibility for my product, and how do i start in general.</p>

<p>Resources are welcome!</p>

<p>The online business i want to create revolves areound an IDE that can be accessed online. The problem im going to solve is that the current online ides arent practical. The space to type is too small and theres no package navigation. They dont have a file system either.
