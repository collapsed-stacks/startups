I have a product and want to get funding using ICO with the chosen crypto-currency. 

 1. How is this possible? 
 2. Is there any roadblock that using crypto-currency than real funding? 
 3. What is the advantage and disadvantage of using crypto in your product?
 4. What is example startup that has used crypto?

I'm curious because I'm building POS System that may accept bitcoin in the future. So I'm investing in research and development at the moment.

Your question is way broader to answer. I want to pick the 3rd point only.

**What is the advantage and disadvantage of using crypto in your product?**

We both know. don't we? Crypto has potential. The blockchain is the future of currency. But nobody knows if it would be Ether or bitcoin or ripple. Or something else will come.

For example, if cryptoruble comes to the existence, it would encourage other governments to launch their currencies. 

So, the first thing, we don't know everything about it. Second, it's hell volatile. You need enough guts to play with it.
