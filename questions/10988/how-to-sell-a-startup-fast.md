<p>I'm talking about a B2B tool that has a potential to quickly gather lots of business customers and their data (sales). The thing is it is prone to be overtaken quickly by some competitors already in the space. That's why I think the best strategy would be to sell it quickly to someone who has the bandwidth to run quickly with it. </p>

<p>What are the best strategies to find buyers/VC's and communicate the intent at the right time?</p>

<p>UPDATE</p>

<p>I know M&amp;A agents but only in the range of 20M - 200M, what are the other options?</p>

<p>A VC isn't going to buy your business from you.  They buy equity in companies that they believe have potential, and frequently as part of their investment, they receive seats on the board of directors or some other means of exerting a little control and oversight of their new investment.</p>

<p>The problem is, <strong><em>you</em></strong> already recognize the weaknesses in your business model going forward, so why wouldn't a potential investor or buyer also see it?  And once they recognize that issue, what would their motivation be for putting money into it?</p>

<p>So, that being said, why are you worried about competitors "overtaking" you?  There are some advantages in having competitors, you know:</p>

<ol>
<li>They help drive consumer awareness of the market by way of their marketing efforts, which collaterally helps you as well.</li>
<li>They drive innovation in the market, giving you motivation to build and offer better products and services.</li>
<li>They keep you on your toes and don't allow you to become too comfortable or complacent, which is the bane of every business.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Any market worth being in will have competitors.</em>  My advice is to stop focusing on the negatives of this and find a way to draw distinctions between what they offer and what you can do better, faster, or cheaper.  Be thankful that there's someone else out there who can help you highlight why people should do business with you rather than the other guys.</p>

<p>Business is a Darwinian process, and if you think you're going to come up with an idea and have it all to yourself, think again.  If you focus on what makes your company great then competition doesn't matter, and you'll be happier for it.  Have faith in what you do, and don't be deterred just because someone else tries to copy you.</p>

<p>I hope this helps.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>I'm talking about a B2B tool that has a potential to quickly gather lots of business customers and their data (sales).</p>

<ul>
<li>"has the potential to quickly gather lots of..." - until you actually gather the customers and their data, your startup is not attractive for selling, probably for copy-cats too. If you can show some traction - huge user database, monthly growth in signups (or anything relevant to measure the profitability potential of your tool), only then you can go out there and find corporations that would like to buy your product.</li>
</ul>

<p>One other remark, even if a company buys your startup, you would probably still need to stay on the team for at least a year or two. If the business needs you than, be sure you'll have a vest and cliff in place.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>Steps to find buyers and communicate the intend:</p>

<ol>
<li>Conduct a research to identify what companies need your technology or your user base and/or data - the potential buyers.</li>
<li>Check on Linkedin who are the decision makers in these companies such as CEOs, Partnership Managers, or other executives, etc.</li>
<li>Check your network of contacts to see who can make a "warm intro" to that relevant person. Success chances are much higher with an introduction.</li>
<li>Once you identify a list of people you need to be introduced to and a list of people who can potentially introduce you to them, design your email message. You need a short text to introduce yourself and your company + describe your traction, ideally attach a pitch deck.</li>
<li><p>Then, approach your potential introducer to ask for the "warm intro" - make sure this person has a good relationship to the person you need to be introduced to. In the message you have to add that short "intro text" so that if that person agrees to make the intro - he/she would just need to forward your message by adding 1 sentence on top of it.</p>

<p>*important - with email intros always use the double-opt-in principle and make sure the person who introduces you to the relevant contact does the same: <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/blog/double-optin-intro/" rel="nofollow">https://www.cbinsights.com/blog/double-optin-intro/</a></p></li>
<li><p>If you can't find someone on your network to introduce you - try cold emailing and try hard. You will probably get a lot of rejections and even worse - "no replies", before you actually get to a call/meeting.</p></li>
<li>Industry related conferences and events are also a nice place to meet those decision makers.</li>
<li>Once you get to the meeting - you have to be very well prepared - you have to be the expert of your product, topic and niche that you belong to. Show some numbers, some traction, a working prototype - anything that proves your concept.</li>
</ol>

<p>Like traditional lead generation, the new model is founded on demonstrating expertise and building trusting relationships — but these goals are accomplished online. While online marketing will continue to evolve, here are ten proven lead generation techniques that are working for professional services firms today.</p>

<p>First though, let’s talk about one of the oldest strategies in online marketing, email marketing:</p>

<p><strong>Email Marketing</strong></p>

<p>Email marketing is one of the few online marketing channels that has stood the test of time. In fact, email is 23 years old this year, and it still trumps the top spot on many B2B marketer’s lists of B2B lead generation strategies. One of the biggest trends in email marketing at the moment, that has generated great results for many B2B businesses, is marketing automation.</p>

<p>Not sure what the fuss about marketing automation is? Read this. In short, marketing automation tools are effectively hybrid email marketing tools that connect with your CRM to enable you to automatically send highly targeted emails to leads that are personalised specifically to them.</p>

<p>When Thomson Reuters upgraded to a marketing automation solution, their revenue increased by 172%. Another company increased their revenue by 832%(going from $80,000 in debt to $2 million in revenue) in just three years. While traditional newsletters and email marketing are still important, the ability to capture more data on users and use behavioural-triggers has enabled B2B marketers to get a lot smarter with how they target users in the inbox.</p>

<p><strong>Lead Generating Website</strong></p>

<p>Most professional services websites are not designed to generate leads. As a matter of fact many are almost “anti-lead generators.” Jargon-filled, firm-centric website abound in the professional services — and they are completely passive and unhelpful. If visitors do not understand what you do or what problems you can solve for them, they will go elsewhere.</p>

<p>Contrast this with a lead generating website that is designed to make it easy for clients to understand your value proposition, download valuable information and request a proposal. The impact on online lead generation can be dramatic. Listed below are some of the top b2b websites with lead generation capabilities:</p>

<ul>
<li>Alibaba</li>
<li>eWorldTrade</li>
<li>Global Sources</li>
<li>Manta</li>
<li>DHgate</li>
</ul>

<p>I would personally recommend eworldtrade since they are <strong>offering up to 10 free b2b leads to all new signups</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Content Marketing: From Blogging to Microsites</strong></p>

<p>By creating a total of 48 infographics, videos, and Q&amp;A blog posts targeting C-level prospects of large market cap financial institutions, the public accounting firm Crowe Horwath generated $250,000 in revenue attributed to content marketing.</p>

<p>If 6-figure growth doesn’t get you excited, perhaps 10-figures (a billion) will. In 2012, Xerox created a microsite offering relevant tips to business owners. The result? 70% of the companies targeted interacted with the microsite, adding 20,000 new contacts to their pipeline, 1,000+ of which scheduled appointments. The value of those appointments exceeded $1.3 billion in pipeline revenue.</p>

<p>Given the broad scope of content marketing, a good question to ask is what type of content should B2B companies be focusing on to generate leads? Well, you could go by which tactics are most commonly used by other B2B companies (displayed below). The risk of this approach is that, by definition, you’ll be doing what everyone else is doing.</p>

<p>While there is some wisdom in following trends, there’s a good argument to do exactly the opposite of what other marketers are focusing on.</p>

<p>“Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect.” – Mark Twain</p>

<p>Whether you’re a contrarian marketer or prefer to stick to what’s working for others, a good content marketing strategy requires a degree of diversity and experimentation to understand where the biggest growth opportunities are for your business.</p>

<p>So, by all means, experiment with the common and uncommon tactics. Whether you use microsites, blogging, research reports, or infographics, the important thing is to test what does and doesn’t work so that you can gradually refine your lead generation over time.</p>

<p><strong>Search Marketing</strong></p>

<p>Organic search marketing is arguably one of the most valuable long-term strategies for generating B2B leads.</p>

<p>About 5-6 years ago, I was working on the SEO campaign for a major business stationery brand. It was one of my first ‘big campaigns’ that I was allowed to manage in my previous job.</p>

<p>While I can’t take the credit (their in-house SEO team and previous agencies had laid a great foundation for us), I watched the site’s revenue from SEO increase by over £4 million, just from a handful of keywords reaching #1 on Google. Getting to #1 in Google is a lot harder today than it was five or ten years ago, and it can barely be summarised in a few sentences.</p>

<p>If I were to attempt it, though, I’d probably say that good SEO in 2015 is largely a bi-product of doing things well in other areas e.g. design, conversion rate optimisation, content marketing, and social. While there are exceptions, this is increasingly looking like the rule.</p>

<p><strong>Social Media</strong></p>

<p>Calling social media an effective B2B lead generation strategy is a controversial discussion to be starting.</p>

<p>While social media scored very well on both of the aforementioned ‘studies’, we can just as easily find reports where social media channels are regarded as the least effective lead generation strategies.</p>

<p>The bottom line is, social media isn’t inherently a poor channel for B2B lead generation. The reason social media is sometimes rated poorly on these aggregate studies is because most B2B companies have an ill-fitting social media strategy, to put it politely.</p>

<p>While tens of thousands of companies blast out self-promotional drivel, a minority of businesses use it generate and nurture millions of dollars worth of leads. In this instance, it’s best to learn from the minority rather than the majority.</p>

<p>One of the most obvious ways to generate B2B leads from social media is using LinkedIn. An commodity risk management company managed to generate over $2 million in pipeline value through their lead generation strategy.</p>

<p>Another consideration is that social media is an integral part of content marketing, and to some extent, search marketing. How successful will your blogging or infographics be if no one’s following your company’s updates on social media?</p>

<p><strong>Integrating it all together</strong></p>

<p>It’s said that success leaves clues. Well, when a $37 billion company generates a 5,100% return on investment on a million-dollar marketing campaign, it might be a pretty good clue. From a $1 million investment in an integrated marketing campaign that included display ads, email marketing, campaign websites and content marketing, the healthcare technology company Optum generated $52 million in new business. So, what’s the clue?</p>

<p>I believe it’s this: exceptional lead generation results come from a relentless willingness to experiment with different tactics, and to combine tactics across multiple channels.</p>

<p>Only by experimenting, can you truly know what does and doesn’t work, and when you know this, you can use your time and budget more effectively to generate higher returns on your investment, and better lead generation results overall.</p>
