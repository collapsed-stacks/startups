We're at about 35 employees with 3 offices in the east and west coasts. We don't even have a company directory, just a shared contact book. I realized i don't even know everyone's name in my office.

We're actively hiring so, I thought it might be a good time to establish a private company social network with apps like Yammer, Chatter, or Socialtext. Wondering if this is the right time?

What are some other strategies to enhance company culture and get new people acquainted better and stay up to date with projects and events?

We started using slack.com with three people and found it incredibly helpful.

The right time, though, is when you have someone willing to set it up, invite everybody and do the work to make it a place people see value in.

Definitely keep your pitch simple. Don't even imply that someone would have to log in to get work done. Keep it optional for a month or maybe forever and start to put valuable resources into it. Great links, internal documents, helpful discussions, Q&A/FAQ, and a bio for early adopters will act as magnets to pull people in. You could even start interviewing team-members and publish exclusively on the network.
