<p>I try to avoid team as much as possible in my startup. But being alone though I was without difference of opinions, I am watching my productivity going to zero. After six months now, I just sit in front of computer and waste time in thinking. Why is this happening to me?  I was able to do things nicely before six months and I was alone at that time. I am not finding someone who would be working with me from my locality. Tough time. How to get past? </p>

<p>It's known negative feature of solo development. </p>

<p>There're two factors:</p>

<ul>
<li>Social</li>
<li>Nothing new</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Social</strong> factor is about absence of like-minded people around you. The need of social beings, of people, is to share with each others with their life events, to discuss it. If you haven't that people, the development process would be boring.</p>

<p><strong>Nothing new</strong> is about your brain wants to see the actual results of your work rather than to build them for a quite long time. So you have to reform your development process to see the "progress bar" of your expected results. It's about self-motivation.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>
