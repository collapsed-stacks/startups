I've looked at tools like Sensor Tower, or App Annie. But they usually require you to fill in keywords to get some data on how competitive they are.

What I'd like to do is just get a list of keywords that have high search volume but low competition (this would be long-tail keywords of two,three words). Is this possible?

I found a tool that might do this but it looks a bit shady. Are there any accredited tools that do this?

I'm using https://www.google.com/trends/ and https://adwords.google.com/KeywordPlanner for this purpose.

Take in account that usually mobile search shorter and simpler than web.
