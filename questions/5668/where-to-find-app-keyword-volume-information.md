<p>I've looked at tools like Sensor Tower, or App Annie. But they usually require you to fill in keywords to get some data on how competitive they are.</p>

<p>What I'd like to do is just get a list of keywords that have high search volume but low competition (this would be long-tail keywords of two,three words). Is this possible?</p>

<p>I found a tool that might do this but it looks a bit shady. Are there any accredited tools that do this?

<p>I'm using <a href="https://www.google.com/trends/" rel="nofollow">https://www.google.com/trends/</a> and <a href="https://adwords.google.com/KeywordPlanner" rel="nofollow">https://adwords.google.com/KeywordPlanner</a> for this purpose.</p>

<p>Take in account that usually mobile search shorter and simpler than web.</p>
