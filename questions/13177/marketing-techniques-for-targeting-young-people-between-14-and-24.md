I've built up a social network that could, at least in my opinion, revolutionize the whole social networking industry because it has innovative functions and market research has shown that people find it amazing. 
My problem: I'm just 16 and I don't have any money that I could spend on advertising. Therefor I've spend a lot of time making my product as engaging as possible and I'm trying to get in a viral growth engine so that the users share the app by themselves.

I'd like to target especially the generation Snapchat, that means young people between 14 and 24.

Do you guys know any special techniques, ways that similar startups have achieved growth or special strategies to acquire users in this target group for nearly no money?

Thanks for every answer!

<p>Getting it to be advertised world-widely, without a budget sounds ambitious :)</p>

<p>You can take a look at <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/george-beall/8-key-differences-between_b_12814200.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">what is known about the Generation Z</a>, which I assume is the one you try to reach. </p>

<p>Common ways tried in the past to go viral is to have your product used or mentioned from a celebrity that is appealing to your target (YouTube one perhaps?). If your product is as superior as you mention, it shouldn't be hard.</p>

<p>Try to find lead-users, a group that would reap the highest advantage/payoff of that network and convince them to use it. These are the early adopters that will bring the other users. Example: instagram started with foodies and models, now everyone is there.</p>
