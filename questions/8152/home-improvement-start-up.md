<p>I have a home improvement business and I'm trying to take it to the next level. I have local clients that support me and give me referral business. If there are any tips or models I can follow it would be very helpful.</p>

<p>I have some experience of these kind of businesses actually.
The answer is PR!</p>

<p>Not sure what country you are in, but look up 'Pimlico Plumbers' in London. They have made a massive business without advertising. Get your website together, add regular case studies. Make sure your site mentions the areas where you work a lot so it shows up in results. Write a press release saying how you are pushing your business forward with a photo of you in front of your van and send it to all of the local newspapers, newsletters etc. Never miss an opportunity to do this. When you buy a new van write a story about it with the van dealer 'local business chooses local van dealer'. When you tak on an apprentice, 'local firm creates jobs'. Journalists are lazy, they love a preprepared story.</p>

<p>Get on Twitter. Use your real name and link to your website. Search for things like 'having trouble finding a good builder' and reply to them with some help.</p>

<p>Last one never ever forget to call back or keep a meeting. This matters to busy people more than price</p>
