(okay, I realize this is not entirely related to startups, but this community was the most business-centric that I could find on the SE network)

I am running a small one-stop agency based in Romania. What I mean by one-stop is that we basically provide all the online services needed for small and medium-sized companies, including branding, content writing, web development and social media marketing.

We have plenty of local clients, but I figured that if we could land some American contracts then we would be able to make top dollar while also being relatively cheap for the potential clients.

How should we start looking for clients in the United States?

I think direct marketing would not work for you, if you have no references from the US market.

The first things that come into my mind, is as sub-contractor or product based acquisitions.

**Sub-Contractors:** Just ask some US web developer firms, if they are in need of low-priced additional capacities. Also you may ask some other companies related to web development (Marketing agencies, Designer studios etc.)

**Product based Acquisitions:** Invest some time and afford into a product (awesome magneto Plugin? Simple Web Service?). Target it on the US market and try to distribute your web dev service as addition.

Of course you can go the hard way and try to acquire some freelancer jobs, but as you do not have a office (or legal representation) there, I personally would avoid that.

Try to find "sales as a service" firm.

**Sales as a Service (SaaS)**  
The SaaS model is a new concept that brings outsourced sales solutions into your business.

**Here are five key benefits of Sales as a Service:**

1. Lower overhead cost.  
Sales as a Service teams do not require you to provide phones, laptops, office space and other resources.

2. Deployment of a larger multi-faceted sales team.  
For the cost of hiring one senior sales person, a company can get access to a full Sales as a Service team

3. Elimination of fixed payroll and benefits costs.  
With Sales as a Service companies pay only for the services rendered and do not have to add individuals to payroll, benefits and travel programs, which reduces cost of sales.

4. Profit from years of established relationships.  
Sales as a Service brings a wide variety of contacts and relationships that can be leveraged to deliver faster results than one person bringing only his or her individual contacts.

5. Increased Sales coverage.  
Sales as a Service allows for a company to expand its reach more quickly than it could with one in house individual.
