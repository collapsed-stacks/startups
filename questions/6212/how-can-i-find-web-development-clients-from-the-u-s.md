<p>(okay, I realize this is not entirely related to startups, but this community was the most business-centric that I could find on the SE network)</p>

<p>I am running a small one-stop agency based in Romania. What I mean by one-stop is that we basically provide all the online services needed for small and medium-sized companies, including branding, content writing, web development and social media marketing.</p>

<p>We have plenty of local clients, but I figured that if we could land some American contracts then we would be able to make top dollar while also being relatively cheap for the potential clients.</p>

<p>How should we start looking for clients in the United States?</p>

<p>I think direct marketing would not work for you, if you have no references from the US market.</p>

<p>The first things that come into my mind, is as sub-contractor or product based acquisitions.</p>

<p><strong>Sub-Contractors:</strong> Just ask some US web developer firms, if they are in need of low-priced additional capacities. Also you may ask some other companies related to web development (Marketing agencies, Designer studios etc.)</p>

<p><strong>Product based Acquisitions:</strong> Invest some time and afford into a product (awesome magneto Plugin? Simple Web Service?). Target it on the US market and try to distribute your web dev service as addition.</p>

<p>Of course you can go the hard way and try to acquire some freelancer jobs, but as you do not have a office (or legal representation) there, I personally would avoid that.</p>

<li><p>Profit from years of established relationships.<br>
Sales as a Service brings a wide variety of contacts and relationships that can be leveraged to deliver faster results than one person bringing only his or her individual contacts.</p></li>
<li><p>Increased Sales coverage.<br>
