<p>So arround 2013 the company I worked at as a sales man at the time has gone in two seperate pieces (son and father had a fight and son decided to go his own way into the business) so I decided back then to go with the son and pawed him a way into large companies.</p>

<p>The business is gumming rollers for all kinds of industries (tobaco, wood, paper etc.) and my job is to find buyers for restoring those rollers, so I travel arroun the country (mainly 3 big cities with the biggest industries) and go to different large and small companies trying to land a deal.</p>

<p>I usually bring bruto gross of around 35.000,00â‚¬ every month sometimes more sometimes less. So now when you account that I get more than 70% of business to the company, is it fair that Im only treated as a normal worker, and not a partner, should I say that I want my % from each months net income and not the paycheck. </p>

<p>You know that partnership involves way more things than just selling the actual product/service, right? </p>

<p>It involves putting money in, discussing strategy, fighting legal battles, hiring/firing people and etc.</p>

<p>Yes you're bringing cash in but how difficult would be to another person do what you do? I'm sales exec myself and believe me, everyone is replaceable - no matter how many deals you can close.</p>

<p>If you want to make more money, no problem with that. Try to negotiate bigger salary, benefits and commissions. But don't go the partner way like that, <strong>asking</strong> your current employer.</p>

<p>If you think you can do what your boss does, then prepare your way out - with a solid business plan. And then, when you become successfull, you will be in a better position to partner and negotiate with anyone you like.</p>

  <p>If partnership were easy, father and son would be together now.</p>
