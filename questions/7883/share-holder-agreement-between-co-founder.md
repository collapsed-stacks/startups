<p>Is it common to have co-founders to sign a agreement to protect the early stage startups, e.g.</p>

<ul>
<li>prevent selling of personal owned equity without board approval</li>
<li>prevent diluting of share without all the people agree</li>
<li>non-compete agreement if the co-founder leave the company</li>
<li>..</li>
</ul>

<p>Are there such a good template to follow?</p>

<p>Yes, co-founders do sign an agreement to protect their idea and startups. Some things on which they agree upon are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Equity Ownership and vesting</li>
<li>Capital Split (while bootstrapping)</li>
<li>Defining the Roles and responsibilities</li>
<li>Concurrent Non-complete  (in case a partner is consulted by any other business about the company.)</li>
</ul>
