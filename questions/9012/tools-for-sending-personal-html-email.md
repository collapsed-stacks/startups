<p>I'm the owner of a personal travel consultancy, clients call us for help and we send them results via E-Mail. (So we don't have Newsletters or similar)</p>

<p>What I need is a tool to send E-Mails which look professional and create them quickly, Outlook doesn't style the HTML correctly and tools like <strong>MailChimp</strong> are not good if there is only one recipient.</p>

<p>Are there better tools out there?</p>

<p>If you need a free solution, try <a href="https://beefree.io/" rel="nofollow">https://beefree.io/</a></p>

<p>I used it a couple of weeks ago to create an email and works a treat. You'd have to be able to copy the resulting HTML into an Email Client. I think you can do that in Outlook?</p>

<p>If I was you, I would create my email template HTML on a HTML editor, then test it on the website <a href="https://www.emailonacid.com/" rel="nofollow">Emails On Acid</a> to ensure the look on the other email softwares.</p>

<p>Then I'll use this template for my professional emails.</p>

<p>PS : the HTML in emails is nether the same on all the mail softs / websites.<br />
If your template looks good on the majors (like Gmail, Outlook, Hotmail, Mail (Mac OS), Thunderbird and Yahoo) it's fine</p>

<p>You could just download a template on Envato and fill it with your content.   </p>

<p>I used that with thunderbird 4 years ago, don't remember what was the setting for that but if you add the code to the html view then switch to normal view it then becomes stylized content filling in the template.</p>
