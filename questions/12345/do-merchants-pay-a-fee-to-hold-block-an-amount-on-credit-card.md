not sure this is the right forum but sometimes businesses can block/hold/reserve an amount on your credit card without actual money leaving my bank account (e.g. as a deposit). 
Do you know how much it usually cost the merchant to do so (if anything)?

The internet is full of advice on what to do to avoid this as a customer - but noone can tell me what it costs. Thank you in advance.

You're referring to a pre-authorization on a credit card.  There may some fees associated with the transaction but it's all dependent on the payment processor and type of transaction (e.g. online, in-store, etc).

For example, Stripe does not charge a pre-auth fee:
