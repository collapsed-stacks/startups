<p>Let's assume the following scenario.</p>

<p>A company has a pre-money valuation of $10 million. An investor wants to invest $5 million and end up owning 33% of the company. Under this deal the ownership split is</p>

<ul>
<li>Founders - 67% </li>
<li>Investor - 33%</li>
</ul>

<p>The investor reveals a clawback provision which says <code>if you reach milestone X by 6 months then my share in the company becomes 25% and the founders own 75%</code>. If the founders reach the milestone and the ownership changes like so -</p>

<ul>
<li>Founders - 75% </li>
<li>Investor - 25%</li>
</ul>

<p>-would that mean that since the investor only received 25% of the company for an investment of $5 million, the valuation of the company is now $20 million ($5 mil * 1/0.25) against the $15 million post money valuation that was initially calculated ?</p>

<p>My hunch is that, that is not how it works and valuation does not change due to this clause.</p>

<p>What are your thoughts ?</p>

<p>Imagine we each put $100k cash into a venture and each get 50% of it too.</p>

<p>Next we agree that who every wins a coin toss gets 100% of the equity.</p>

<p>I win and you're out $100k.</p>

<p>Next you offer to buy the company back at its cash value, and I agree to sell it to you.</p>

<p>How much cash did I get back in total?  </p>

<p>Point is that clawbacks impact the value of what you own, not the value of company.</p>
