I'm a web developer by trade, which might be part of my problem.

I run an online web site. It's a custom PHP web site. To update any of the web site I would need to edit HTML, and deploy the code via a deployment script.

I have an expensive web developer who can make changes upon request, but it feels like that would cost too much over time.

Basically, I'm at a delegation stalemate, and the marketing site has not changed much in three years because of it.

How would you overcome this? Would it be to make the web site into a CMS-backed site that our content editor (non-developer) could edit? Or hire a cheaper web developer?

If you are a Web developer, you should be able to do that yourself. However, there are a few different scenarios to consider. 

 1. How often do you need to update? 
If you won't have regular updates, you might want to avoid moving to a CMS, since you would most likely need to hire someone to do it anyway. 

On the other hand, if you need regular updates, that might be worth it. 

 2. If you find a cheaper developer, can you guarantee that he'll deliver the quality you need on time, instead of getting lost in the code? 

In the end it's your decision, and only you will know what's best for your company, but these are things to consider.
