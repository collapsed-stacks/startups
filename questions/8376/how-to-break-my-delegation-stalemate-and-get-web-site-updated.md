<p>I'm a web developer by trade, which might be part of my problem.</p>

<p>I run an online web site. It's a custom PHP web site. To update any of the web site I would need to edit HTML, and deploy the code via a deployment script.</p>

<p>I have an expensive web developer who can make changes upon request, but it feels like that would cost too much over time.</p>

<p>Basically, I'm at a delegation stalemate, and the marketing site has not changed much in three years because of it.</p>

<p>How would you overcome this? Would it be to make the web site into a CMS-backed site that our content editor (non-developer) could edit? Or hire a cheaper web developer?</p>

<p>If you are a Web developer, you should be able to do that yourself. However, there are a few different scenarios to consider. </p>

<ol>
<li>How often do you need to update? 
If you won't have regular updates, you might want to avoid moving to a CMS, since you would most likely need to hire someone to do it anyway. </li>
</ol>

<p>On the other hand, if you need regular updates, that might be worth it. </p>

<ol start="2">
<li>If you find a cheaper developer, can you guarantee that he'll deliver the quality you need on time, instead of getting lost in the code? </li>
</ol>

<p>In the end it's your decision, and only you will know what's best for your company, but these are things to consider. </p>
