<p>Facebook began in Harvard, and then <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2004/3/1/facebook-expands-beyond-harvard-harvard-students/" rel="nofollow">expanded to others universities</a>, step by step, this was a master move from M.Zuckerberg. </p>

<p>In this context of expansion of a web-app, if I begin in a "X" country and my startup (web-app like google, trello, instagram) is successful:</p>

<p>How can I expand to others countries, in the sense of being effective in my entrance to the foreign society?</p>

<p>I'm thinking of expanding to other countries because in the same country is easier to communicate an idea, i.e., local radio, local newspaper, local webpages, local persons networks, etc.</p>

<p>Here's a general idea using the concept of generic <em>areas</em> as opposed to whole countries. But first, let's make some simple assumptions:</p>

<ul>
<li>All of the areas use the same language</li>
<li>For each area you want to expand into, there will be a sizable number of people in your target market who know someone from an area that you are already active in</li>
<li>Your target markets in each of the areas generally have similar interests</li>
</ul>

<p>Okay, so given these, we can focus on actually getting your webapp out there:</p>

<ol>
<li>Try to choose areas where there is already a visible amount of interest. If there are no areas with interest yet, perhaps you need to better market your product in the area you are already deployed in.</li>
<li>Prioritize deployment into new areas by interest level, target market size, and the "connectedness" of those new areas into areas where your product is already gaining traction.</li>
<li>Make your product available for free, with additional options or features available with a subscription. For instance:
<ul>
<li>Google Apps: free for individual users, paid plan allows businesses to manage all of their users and use their own domain. Paid plans also add additional features and space.</li>
<li>Trello: basic features are available for free, additional features and data management is available with their paid plans.</li>
<li>GitHub: free for all users, private repos cost $, enterprise deployments on their own infrastructure cost $$$.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>See if you can get your expansion mentioned in a local news/blog/aggregator site. Alternatively, if you are adding multiple areas at a time, see if you can get mentioned in a large tech media site (<a href="http://techcrunch.com/" rel="nofollow">TechCrunch</a>, <a href="http://lifehacker.com/" rel="nofollow">Lifehacker</a>, etc.) or popular news aggreagators (really just <a href="http://slashdot.org/" rel="nofollow">Slashdot</a> and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/" rel="nofollow">Hacker News</a>).</li>
<li>Consider just making your webapp available to all users everywhere from Day I. Whether this is a good idea or not depends on your actual app, but seriously think it through.</li>
</ol>
