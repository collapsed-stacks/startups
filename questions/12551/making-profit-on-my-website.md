Just a quick post... I'm a little confused by your website, to be honest. As a user, I can't tell if it's a music blog, a shop for apparel, a political blog (see the Hero Rats or American Airlines posts), or a promotional site for up and coming artists. 

The layout's not the problem, although it could do with some tweaking, it's more the content. I'd suggest focusing on one thing. If your aim is to make money, then focus on apparel.

Talking of apparel, your shop seems a little disjointed. The Skully and Varsity Jacket are wildly different designs to the FPC and Chuck Norris designs. Personally, I'd discontinue the latter and just push the LH brand for now.

Final suggestion for now, if you're wanting to start a blog, please (please, please!) proof-read before you post:


    "Definatly worth a look if your a aspiring entrepreneur"
                            should be
    "Definitely worth a look if you're an aspiring entrepreneur"
