I just started an startup month ago with team of 10 members , I got an high end project, We are in middle of documentation i provided him complete application development documentation which includes almost every application development process and pricing . But client's want an separate documentation on how we provide application support after development , DFD on same .

I don't have anyone on team who can do this type of documentation , even i have invested all into office and etc. 

So kindly anyone provide me any templates or what points comes under providing support after development.

Your prospect is likely expecting a document that clarifies how you intend to provide maintenance and support in the future. I take it this is an enterprise client or a business that is large enough to have a few buying processes in place.

Key things I'd look at in that position off the top of my head:

- How long do you commit to maintaining and supporting the software? Is there a limit beyond which you're no longer willing to work on it? (Think Win XP.) If so, is it acceptably long?

- Process and costs when I report a bug? Is it something you'll fix for free or charge or is it on my dime? Assuming the former (and I would insist it should be the case), for how long?

- Assuming you don't want to commit your life to fixing bugs, you'll add a maximum number of man hours or man days per month. I might refuse if I've a big enough check book and am able to arm wrestle the point in ink. But assuming I'm OK with the idea or let go, how many? Do I get to keep these man days when I don't use them? (If not, do I at least get to keep the previous month's credits?)

- After that period elapses or beyond that limit, how much will you charge for bug fixes?

Other things I'd look at include:

- Process and costs when I request an enhancement or a new feature? For how long?

- Process and costs when I need documentation updates? For how long?

- Process and costs when I need extra training for new staff? For how long?

Think of it this way: the person who is sponsoring you to whoever signs is taking ownership. He or she doesn't want any loose ends or surprises down the road, because their job is on the line. So write a reassuring doc that lists what can go wrong, what action steps you're taking to avoid that they do, and what the processes are to ensure things go smoothly once you've shipped.

Also, keep in mind that your prospect will have a squadron of lawyers dive into your proposal. So ask an attorney for some extra guidance IMO. And come back to them down the road to vet or amend the draft you wrote - it's a lot cheaper than having them write it from scratch.
