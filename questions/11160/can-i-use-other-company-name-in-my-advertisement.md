For example, if I produce mouse specifically for Apply computer name, can I say "this product is for Apple computer" with its (Apple) logo?

Can Apple prevent me from using word Apple and its logo when advertising my product. If that its the case the how can I tell my customers that my product is for Apple computer?

Generally speaking, using another company's name without authorization [is considered fair use](http://www.inta.org/INTABulletin/Pages/NotAllIsFair(Use)inTrademarksandCopyrights.aspx) but using its logo, characteristic elements of its visual identity (e.g. its typography), or implying its endorsement without consent is not. Put another way, don't be misleading about your relationship with a third party. (*Particularly* when the [third party](https://gamingreinvented.com/nintendoarticles/top-ten-nintendo-fanworks-cancelled-due-legal-complaints/) is a [large firm](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/a-broke-fan-owes-5400-for-trying-to-throw-a-pokemon-themed-party) that can [lawyer up](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20100510/0043149349.shtml).)

For Apple specifically, make sure you double check if you might need to get permission from them if you'd like to use their logo. As a guess, you almost certainly need an agreement in place, and you'll likely need some kind of certification to boot if you're developing Apple-compatible hardware and want their logo on your packaging. If it's iOS related check Apple's [MFi program](https://developer.apple.com/programs/mfi/), as it might answer your question. If it's Mac related, look for other programs that might apply instead.

Last but not least, check with a lawyer if in doubt. (IANAL)
