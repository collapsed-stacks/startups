<p>I have a startup S-corporation, which I expect will operate for several months "at a loss", before it starts earning good money.</p>

<p>I initially [under-]funded it as "initial purchase of shares" with my personal savings, and I also made my kids minority share-holders.  There is still a lot of un-issued stock left.</p>

<p>I would now like to use some of my own savings to add funds to the S-corp, to cover its expenses and hire employees.  What is the best way to do this, such that it reduces my &amp; S-corp's taxes (possibly by initially resulting in a loss against my overall income), and generally makes the most sense?</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Buy more shares from the S-corp?</strong>  I don't like the aspect that my purchase
of more shares would likely reduce the % ownership of my kids.  Could
I "drastically overpay" for only 1 share to keep the ownership
percentages approximately unaffected?  I am also afraid that this may
increase the valuation and basis for my kids, possibly requiring them
to pay taxes?</li>
<li><strong>Loan it money?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Other options?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>To be honest, all the options above are valid (though you would have to check on the tax rules). However, if your only concern for purchasing more stock is that it will dilute your kids' shares, you have a few options.</p>

<ol>
<li>You said that there are un-issued shares. you can "buy" some in your children's name.</li>
<li>You can buy them all in your name, and either gift them to your children, or assign it as inheritance.</li>
</ol>

<p>Lending might be a bit more complicated (I'm no expert), since you would most likely have to have a contract and such, and that may prove to be more of a hassle farther down the road, since your company will essentially owe you money, and you will have to include that in reports and the such, as well as possibly pay taxes for the amount received when you get repaid, since it was income.</p>
