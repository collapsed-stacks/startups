<p>I own an LLC in Oklahoma. In 2016, I purchased the other member's share/rights/interest per the rules defined in our Article of Organization. </p>

<p>I am now the only member (although I plan on hiring contractors in the near future). My accountant says I must file for a new EIN because 50% or more of the business membership has changed. I tend to agree with him on that point as this seems to be the case per the IRS. </p>

<p>He had also said that I have to change the name of the LLC since the previous LLC "dissolved" when I bought out my parter. Is this correct? I cannot find anyone saying this online. </p>

<p>I prefer not to change the name as I already own a website, business cards, posters, expensive logo, etc and already have a positive local reputation. I would not have bought his share and would have dissolved the company instead otherwise. </p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p><strong>Here's the source for why I believe I do in fact need a new EIN, but does not address my name change question:</strong></p>

<p>Partnerships
You will be required to obtain a new EIN if any of the following statements are true.</p>

<ul>
<li>You incorporate.</li>
<li>Your partnership is taken over by one of the partners and is operated
as a sole proprietorship.</li>
<li>You end an old partnership and begin a new one.</li>
</ul>

<p>You will not be required to obtain a new EIN if any of the following statements are true.</p>

<ul>
<li>The partnership declares bankruptcy.</li>
<li>The partnership name changes.</li>
<li>You change the location of the partnership or add other locations.</li>
<li>A new partnership is formed as a result of the termination of a partnership under IRC section 708(b)(1)(B).</li>
<li>50 percent or more of the ownership of the partnership (measured by interests in capital and profits) changes hands within a twelve-month period (terminated partnerships under Reg. 301.6109-1).</li>
</ul>

<p>For good reasons: it's incorrect. For precisely the reason you spell out among others:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I prefer not to change the name as I already own a website, business cards, posters, expensive logo, etc and already have a positive local reputation. I would not have bought his share and would have dissolved the company instead otherwise.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The company did not "dissolve", it changed hands. No name change or rebranding is necessary.</p>

<p>(If it was, you'd have problems all the time in publicly traded companies.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My accountant says I must file for a new EIN because 50% or more of the business membership has changed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not 100% sure but intuitively this is <em>also</em> wrong for the very same reason. Your company did <em>not</em> dissolve. Its owners simply changed. Yet your accountant seems to be processing it as if it had been dissolved and recreated.</p>

<p>Double check though because I'm not US based.</p>

<p>And if that last point is correct, seriously consider getting a new accountant.</p>
