<p>based in the west coast now and looking for a developer to join my team for a digital health startup. What's the best way to go about posting and recruiting someone who is skilled and interested in growing with a startup? we would anticipate an initial side project and then potentially coming on full time if we can get traction.
Thanks!</p>

<p>I would suggest taking a look at <a href="https://www.f6s.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">F6S.com</a> if you are looking for developers with a startup mindset.</p>

<p>There are job sections where you can place your requirements and compensation, including offering equity; such job listing is currently free.</p>

<p>There are also articles giving advice on how to proceed in the different stages of your startup.</p>

<p>It provides opportunities to network, for example you may be seeking a mentor, or Business Development specialist, to make contact with now for a more formal arrangement in the future. </p>

<p>There is also an aggregation of different programs available to startups in terms of free / reduced cost offers by service companies, which could help get you started, and also funding opportunities (in return for equity of course - nothing is free).</p>

<p>On the recruitment side, you can seek a co-founder, technical resource, marketing specialist etc.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: I have no affiliation with F6S.com; I do have a profile on the site, as a Lead Developer / CTO.</p>

<p>The best way is try local meetup groups and contact the developers there. It's <strong>very hard</strong> to convince someone on the Internet about your business, you should do it <strong>face-to-face</strong>.</p>

<p>I am a developer myself and I have received several startup invitations. It's the cheapest and most effective way if you don't have money to pay for salary.</p>

<p>Also try CoFounderlab and Founderdating websites - there are plenty of people that are looking to fulfill these roles for equity.</p>
