Android apps take about an hour, while iOS apps take about a week to deploy. What are tips and tricks to achieve the benefits of continuous deployment when it is technically really hard to achieve?

<p>The release cycle of mobile is one of its downsides compared to the web, but there are a few things you can do to make it better:</p>

<ol>
<li>If you're building an app that you use yourself ("dogfooding"), then you can do continuous delivery within the company by regularly delivering new builds to all co-workers (internal builds don't have to go through an app store). </li>
<li>Even with a native mobile app, some of the content can be determined dynamically by your servers, which you can update any time. See <a href="http://engineering.linkedin.com/mobile/mobile-ab-testing-linkedin-how-members-shape-our-apps" rel="nofollow">Mobile A/B testing at LinkedIn: how members shape our apps</a> for more info.</li>
<li>You can take idea #2 even further by using a WebView (i.e., a web browser) within the mobile app for rapidly changing parts of the UI. This has downsides, such as slower performance and a look &amp; feel and interactions that won't quite feel native, but if you need to iterate quickly, it can be worth it. </li>
</ol>

Since, for native apps on app stores there is a review process for getting approved I am not sure if a true continuous integration will be feasible.
However, one potential way to achieve that is using a mobile site instead of an app. Where the app just is a way to access the site. This way, whenever you make any changes to the website you can deploy it to everyone.
