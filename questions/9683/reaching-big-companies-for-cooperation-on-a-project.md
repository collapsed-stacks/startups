I want to apply for a scholarship which supports innovative technology projects. My problem is that one of the requirements is to have a letter of intent from a company, stating that they are interested in such product/service.

My idea is related to insurance business and the only option I see is to contact some big insurance company. I don't know what would be the appropriate way to do that. I do no have a lot of experience with this, but I imagine that reaching a decision maker in a big company is not easy. 

What would be the best way to reach companies and propose a cooperation on such project? I will propose a considerable discount on the solution once it is completed and I will not require any financial support from the company during the development, but I am still not sure whether big firms are normally interested in such projects.
