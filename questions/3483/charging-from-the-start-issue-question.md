I am running a website in a country that links companies with foreign models. There are several successful sites that make a lot of money by charging companies to post modeling gigs.

I have added many features that blow my competitors away, but I do have a problem.

I want to charge for my service from the start, but Companies will not pay to post gigs if there are no resumes on my site and models will not come to the site if there are no modeling gigs. 

What is the best thing to do in this type of situation?

This chicken and egg problem is one that is typically solved by identifying value that you can deliver to one or the other side of the equation that makes the site worth going to *without* the opposite side.

(Usually it's the demand side, which is to say the models in your specific case.)
