That would completely depends on the mobile app.

But whatever it is, think of it as "low".

Get real here... There's an entire industry out there (sports clubs) where the deal is to offer quarterly or yearly access to sports facilities. At the core of their business model are the scores of initially motivated users who stop using the facilities after a few weeks.

You may or may not have also noted that women magazines tend to put e.g. tasty desert recipes forward in the winter, and diet and fitness tips as summer approaches. I wouldn't be the slightest bit surprised if your sales figures reflect that.

Wearables such as Apple Watch might change that somewhat if Jacques Attali's [brief history of the future](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Brief_History_of_the_Future) continues to spectacularly pan out (that wikipedia article is missing a key mention, btw, namely hypersurveillance, which is basically big brother all over, done by public and private actors, and which we are evidently and steadily heading towards). But I sincerely doubt they will.
