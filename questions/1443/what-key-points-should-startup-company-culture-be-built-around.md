<p>Every startup company has a different culture, what are the elements of those companies and what are the elements which all startup companies should have?</p>

<p>Here are a few that top my mind! Hope it helps at all :-)</p>

<p>Do:</p>

<ul>
<li>Integrity, humbleness, no tolerance for confidentiality breach for example.  Generally a good approach to build your team around people who are content in who they are and do not feel the need to run their mouth to people (I've been one of those people, then attracted people like me, and it turned out to be a huge disaster). </li>
<li>a high level skill set</li>
<li>the confidence to share ideas and critique others in a respectful way</li>
<li>somebody who shows leadership potential and can make individual decisions, but obviously prefers getting feedback from more than him/herself</li>
</ul>

<p>Don't:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Demand leadership, leadership has to be received and not demanded. Accept that your employees will be much smarter than you, and learn from them to become a more effective leader instead of taking the wheel and steering great people in directions they feel wrongly about.</p></li>
<li><p>hire people who don't believe in your mission statement.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Good luck! I'm a 6 year CEO of mid-sized business now launching a startup.</p>

<p>I'm going against all these answers from my experience with a handful of very different startups, all very succesful. I've seen humble and arrogant teams, teams with a lot of rules, teams without any rules, and so on.</p>

<p>There's some psychology about this as well, iirc the Hartman model, applied to companies. Basically you want all different personalities in your company - but all companies have a preference. For example, the police is usually a more 'lawful' company, and the hospital is more 'about people'. Sometimes this has to do with the work/market, but not always.</p>

<p>So, my answer would be: apart from the no-go area's, anything goes -- as long as you all agree on what the culture should be.</p>

<p>No-go area's all boil down to 'selfishness', such as Greed and Political games. F.ex. playing people against each other for personal gain. As long as everyone is part of a team, you're good - if you're breaking the team, you should go.</p>

<p>I would recommend starting with basics that are important for all businesses to function best:</p>

<p><strong>Dos</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Cooperation</li>
<li>Trust</li>
<li>Humor</li>
<li>Sharing of Ideas</li>
<li>Hard work</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Don'ts</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Rank based</li>
<li>Intensives to keep secrets (Includes in company completion that effect important things like pay)</li>
</ul>

<p>The culture will also change based on who you hire. Employees set the culture find employees who do what you need how you need at it should fall into place. </p>
