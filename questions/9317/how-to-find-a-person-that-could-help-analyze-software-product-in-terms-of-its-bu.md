<p>I have an idea for a SaaS project. However, I am a software engineer, and so is my partner. I need someone who could help me understand what kind of hidden aspects there are, where to find the right investors, what are the costs of development and infrastructure needed to run the service, etc.</p>

<p>Another problem is that such a project would need validation, however, this is an idea that is completely new, and the market is not aware yet of its need for this service. How does one validate something like that? Or, how would one attract investment for such a project?</p>

<p>Kickstarter campaigns are good ways to validate a product in the current market, you will require an mvp (minimal viable product) and a marketing campaign </p>
